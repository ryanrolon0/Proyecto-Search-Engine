The central theme of the book is fearlessness. The back cover says nihil timendum est, meaning nothing is to be feared. Each of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 learned this Fearless Philosophy in Southside Queens. The 50th Law illustrates universal laws by supplementing anecdotes from 50's life with historical examples from Malcolm X, Miles Davis, Sun Tzu, François de La Rochefoucauld, Machiavelli, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Thucydides, Dostoyevsky, Charlie Parker, and the Baron de Montesquieu. #See Things For What They Are (Intense Realism) #Make Everything Your Own (Self-Reliance) #Turn Shit Into Sugar (Opportunism) #Keep Moving (Calculated Momentum) #Know When To Be Bad (Aggression) #Lead From The Front (Authority) #Know Your Environment From The Inside Out (Connection) #Respect The Process (Mastery) #Push Beyond Your Limits (Self-Belief) #Confront Your Mortality (The Sublime)
