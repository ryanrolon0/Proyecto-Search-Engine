The hero of The Good Shepherd is Commander Krause, the captain of a US Navy destroyer in World War II. Krause is in overall command of an escort force protecting an Atlantic convoy in the Battle of the Atlantic. He finds himself in a difficult position. The voyage in question occurs early in 1942, shortly after America's entry into the war. Although he is an experienced officer, with many years of seniority, this is Krause's first wartime mission. The captains of the other escort vessels are junior to him, and much younger, but they have been at war for over two years. His relative inexperience troubles him. The hero broods over his career; his wife left him partly because of his strict devotion to duty. He is troubled when the press of duty forces him to neglect his prayers. (Unlike most of Forester's other heroes, Krause is devout.) And he is troubled by recollections that the Navy review board had twice passed him over for promotion, returning a judgement of fitted and retained. His promotion to Commander only came when the United States entered the war, leading him to fear that he may be unsuited to his command. The book illustrates the difficulties of the Atlantic war: the struggle against the sea, the enemy, and the exhaustion brought on by constant vigilance. It also details the problems of the early radar and ASDIC equipment available and the poor communications between the fleet and Admiralty.
