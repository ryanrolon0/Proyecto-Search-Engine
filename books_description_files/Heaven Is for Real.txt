Todd Burpo, a Christian pastor, says that during the months after emergency surgery, Colton began describing events and people that seemed impossible for him to have seen or met. Examples include his miscarried sister, who no one had told him about, and his great grandfather who died 30 years before Colton was born. Colton also made other extra-biblical claims that he had personally sat in Jesus' lap, while the angels sang songs to him, as, for example, that he saw the Virgin Mary standing beside Jesus in Heaven.
