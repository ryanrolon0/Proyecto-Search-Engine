The story begins in December 2001. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon meets with old aide Phil Thomson, a government official. Thomson proposes to Vince the creation of a covert group consisting of McMahon's most refined wrestlers, knowing their exaggerated, constantly touring lifestyle will provide excellent cover. McMahon accepts the deal, and recruits John Cena, Triple H, Dave Batista, Chavo Guerrero, Torrie Wilson, and finally himself as leader. By March 2006, the team has formed a tight unit, and is given its latest assignment, to break into a methyl-amphetamine development lab that is financially supporting terrorists in the European regions. When one of their own is taken prisoner, the wrestlers must stage a rescue which could endanger their careers and their lives.
