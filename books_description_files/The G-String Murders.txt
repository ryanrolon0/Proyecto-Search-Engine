Gypsy Rose Lee narrates her way through a tale of a double murder, backstage at the "Old Opera" burlesque theatre on Forty-Second Street, New York. In a world populated by strippers, comics and costume salesman. A world where crime is part of the norm and where women struggle to earn a living and have gangster boyfriends. The narrative is a "wise-cracking" and humorous tale of murder in a burlesque house, and with the unusual weapon of the title.
