The book is a non-fiction travel book, narrated in the first person by the independently travelling author. Three different journeys from the period 2001-2003 are described in three main chapters: The Utterly Deep South While traveling in Patagonia the author manages to get a discounted "last minute ticket" to a cruise to Antarctica. He has to wait a couple of weeks in South America for the cruise to begin, and spends the time hiking in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile and near El Calafate in Argentina. The main part of the chapter is dedicated to describing what visiting Antarctica is like. In and Out of Africa A travelogue from two months of independent travel ("[backpacking]") in Southern Africa. The trip begins and ends in Cape Town, looping through South Africa and its neighbouring countries, most of the time visiting national parks and small towns. Summer in the Pity A month of travel on and along the Trans-Siberian Railway, starting in Vladivostok and ending in Moscow, with several stops in between. A part of the distance is done by boat, from Kazan to Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga River.
