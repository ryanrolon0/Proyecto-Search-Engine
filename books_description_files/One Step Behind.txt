Two young women and one young man, inexplicably dressed as the nobility of Sweden did during the reign of Gustavus III, are found dead, all slain with a single bullet, their bodies half consumed by animals in the wilderness. Wallander is horrified when he makes a connection between the crime and his close friend Svedberg, and after the latter is found savagely murdered in his own apartment, the tormented detective finds himself up against a deranged, merciless killer who remains just one step ahead of him.
