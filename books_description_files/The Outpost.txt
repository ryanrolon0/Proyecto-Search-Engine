The novel is divided into 3 sections: Legend, Fact, and History. In Legend, the characters tell stories of what they were doing before they arrived and about people they met and things they did. The storytelling is interrupted by an alien invasion of the system, to which the heroes react. The History section sees everyone gathered back at the Outpost to share their stories and find out the fates of the others. *Catastrophe Baker and the Dragon Queen *The Last Landship (Hellfire Carson) *The Greatest Painting of All Time (Little Mike) *The Short, Star-Crossed Career of Magic Adbul-Jordan (Big Red) *When Iron-Arm McPherson Took the Mound (Big Red) *The Night Bet-a-World O'Grady Met High-Stakes Eddie *Catastrophe Baker and the Siren of Silverstrike
