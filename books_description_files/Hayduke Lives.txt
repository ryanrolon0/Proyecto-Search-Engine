Hayduke Lives! picks up after the (literal) cliffhanger at the end of the previous book and chronicles George Washington Hayduke's escape from Federal agents and his return to the deserts of southern Utah and northern Arizona. It also reunites Hayduke with the outlaw-heroes from The Monkey Wrench Gang as they battle the world's biggest walking dragline and a Mormon preacher in another attempt to save the American Southwest. Both books have been reprinted numerous times due to their popularity.
