What started as a travel log becomes an adventure of tragedy, triumph and fierce loyalty, as two very different writers with differing beliefs confront their pasts, their faiths and each other in an 800&nbsp;km (500&nbsp;mi) journey on foot along the Camino de Santiago, in pursuit of their own brand of redemption. Laced with raw humor, heartache and lashings of local vino, Best and Bowles combine candor and courage to capture the essence of modern day pilgrimage.
