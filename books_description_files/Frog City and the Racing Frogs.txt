Frog City and the Racing Frogs centres on Todd Tinpot, a frog who needs to win Superfrog in order to avoid being evicted from his home. However he has never trained or raced before. He gets some help from Boris at the gym but can never seem to do well in races. Sly's henchmen almost kill him in one of the races and, as this resulted in Todd missing three races, Todd got a free entry into Superfrog. Todd knew it would be hard to win so, together with Gecko, he times each route to find out which is best. Todd and Gecko are right and, on the day of the race, Todd takes the route they planned, wins the race and stays in his home
