He asks Spirou and Fantasio to join them. Thus, the two go to the Australia, accompanied by Seccotine, which was essential. When they arrive, Donahue informs them that the Count was killed by miners. After investigation, they discover that the Count did not die but the heroes find him in bad shape, face to face with Sam, a gangster who grows rich by holding prospectors to ransom. Sam ends up dying when his truck explodes because of a bottle of nitroglycerin. Thanks to the aboriginals, of which they were allies, Spirou, Donahue and the Count put in rout Sam's men who are trying to eliminate Fantasio and Seccotine.
