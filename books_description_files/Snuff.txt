Commander Sam Vimes is forced by his wife, Lady Sybil, to take a vacation with their son, Young Sam, at her family's mansion Crundells. After a short time of enjoying his vacation, he discovers that the rural community has a dark past with the resident goblins, humanoid lifeforms that live in caves nearby. Vimes finds out that the son of Lord Rust has been enslaving goblins to force them to work on his tobacco plantations in Howondaland, allowing him to manufacture cigars cheaply that are then smuggled to Ankh-Morpork. After teaming up with the local constable, a young man called Upshot, Vimes manages to arrest those responsible for the crime. In the end, thanks to his wife's organizational skills and powers of persuasion, goblins are recognized as citizens by all major nations and rulers. While Rust's son flees abroad, Vetinari considers having him removed.
