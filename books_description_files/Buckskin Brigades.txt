The book references a journal entry from Meriwether Lewis during the Lewis & Clark Expedition. In a July 27, 1806 entry, Lewis describes how he had killed a Blackfeet Native American chief during the expedition, and in another entry in the journal he mentions a white man living with the Blackfeet tribe. Part of Hubbard's story is based on this white man, referred to in the book by his Native American name, "Yellow Hair". After the death of the Native American chief, Yellow Hair attempts to protect his adopted people from fur traders. Yellow Hair is sent to join the fur traders and learn how their future operations will affect his people. The white fur traders are portrayed as evil savages.
