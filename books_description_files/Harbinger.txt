The U.S.S. Enterprise is damaged after being the first ship to travel to the edge of the galaxy. They are traveling through the Taurus Reach and are surprised to find a new Federation facility, Starbase 47 A.K.A. Vanguard. Captain James T. Kirk is puzzled at this place for many reasons, including it being so near the xenophobic Tholian Assembly. Kirk has his ship dock for repairs. The Tholians, the Orions, and the Klingon Empire all believe there is much more to the establishment of this odd new starbase and there is.
