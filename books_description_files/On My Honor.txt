It is about two boys, Joel and Tony, who are friends despite their very different characters. Tony, who is adventurous, challenges Joel, who is more responsible and cautious, to climb a large and dangerous cliff called Starved Rock. Joel knows this is unsafe and does not want anyone to get hurt, yet does not want to seem like a coward in front of Tony. Tony suggests a swimming race in a forbidden river, despite the fact that he's not a good swimmer. Joel tries to dissuade Tony from doing so as the river has very strong currents, but eventually agrees to the race. Joel ends up winning the race, but when he turns to look back at Tony, he finds that he has disappeared. Joel tries to find Tony in the river, but gets sucked into a current himself. However, he grabs a log, and manages to pull himself to safety. Joel lives with the horrible secret until Tony's and Joel's families finds out.
