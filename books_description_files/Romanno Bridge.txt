The book is a sequel to Greig's second novel, The Return of John MacNab. It reunites the main characters from the previous book, and teams them with a half-Maori rugby player and a busker from Oslo, in a quest for the Stone of Scone. The action takes place mainly in Scotland, but it also includes sections set in Norway and England. Like The Return of John MacNab, this novel is something of a homage to the stories of John Buchan, although the connection is not made explicit this time around.
