Set in the year 2007, the former Soviet Union is engaged in a civil war; an island penal colony in Indonesia has become a major hub for the world's black market; the United States is engaged in a high-tech war against a guerrilla army in southern Mexico, and a draft has been reinstated. Amid the turmoil of the new century, a young man, Greg Kovinski, and his anti-war activist friends come into control of enough riemanium to build a bomb. As he struggles to "do the right thing," the city of Oakland rises in revolt akin to the Paris Commune and a revolution begins.
