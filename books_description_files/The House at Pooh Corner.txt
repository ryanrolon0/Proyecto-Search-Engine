The title comes from a story in which Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet build a house for Eeyore. In another story the game of Poohsticks is invented. Hints that Christopher Robin is growing up, scattered throughout the book, come to a head in the final chapter, in which the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood throw him a farewell party after learning that he must leave them for good soon. It is made obvious – though not stated explicitly – that he is starting school. In the end, as they say good-bye to Christopher Robin, they realise they will never see him again. Pooh and Christopher Robin say a long, private farewell, in which Pooh promises never to forget him.
