The book deals with the rebellion of the Cretans against the Ottoman Empire in the year 1889. It is thought that the book is titled after Kazantzakis' father Michalis Kazantzakis from whom the writer was inspired. The word Captain is not used in its naval or military rank sense, but more as a chieftain title given to prominent members of the Cretan society. Freedom or Death was added as a subtitle to the second edition in Greek released by Difros publishers in Athens in 1955 and was the preferred English (US) title. In the UK the book was published as Freedom and Death.
