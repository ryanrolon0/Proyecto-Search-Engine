The story opens in the late summer of 1955. Nineteen year old Harry Preston, having been granted an early discharge from national service with the RAF, moves to London from a small English provincial town. Fancying himself as a writer, he drifts towards the central district of Soho, where he meets an out of work actor, James Street. Street introduces Harry to the bohemian way of life and the novel recounts their misadventures.
