Álex de la Iglesia signs only two pages of this novel. In this introduction he states he's found a laptop computer lost by poet Juan Carlos Satrústegui. On it, he's read a file called Payasos en la lavadora. Since Satrústegui has entered a mental sanatorium, De La Iglesia talks with the writer's mother and decides to publish the text after correcting it. It's a parody of the old literary technique of the false document found by chance, probably influenced by the fact that, in real life, Álex de la Iglesia writes his film scripts on a laptop computer, which he's lost at least twice. According to this introduction, the restin fifteen chapters are Juan Carlos Satrústegui's autobiographic tale. Satrústegui considers himself a genius, superior over all those he comes across. But we soon realise his psychic problems (obsessions, deliria, paranoia, lack of empathy...) which get worse due to the drugs he uses in fiestas, the want of slept and the beatings he earns when dealing with the lumpen.
