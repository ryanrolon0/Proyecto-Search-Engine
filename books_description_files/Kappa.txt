A psychiatric patient has lost his way and arrives at the country of Kappa. He is treated as a special guest and talks with Kappas of many occupations. Geeru, a radical capitalist, states that the unemployed labourers of Kappas are killed and their flesh is provided for food. The patient is astonished but Geeru argues that because the Japanese women in the poorest class are obliged to survive by prostitution, the patient's opposition is sentimental. Kappa's national characteristics are materialism and nihilistic realism. The babies of Kappa control their destiny. While in the womb, the fetus can refuse life as a Kappa, and be aborted. The Maggu, the sceptical philosopher Kappa committed suicide and appears as a ghost through the person of Tokku, a poet. Maggu is concerned about his fame after his death, although he admires the writers and philosophers who has died by suicide such as Heinrich von Kleist and Otto Weininger. At last the patient is due to return to the real human world, but muses that Kappa was clean and superior to human society and becomes a misanthrope.
