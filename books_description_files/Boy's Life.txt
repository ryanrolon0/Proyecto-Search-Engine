The book deals with 12-year-old Cory Mackenson, who grows up in the town of Zephyr, Alabama. The story begins as Cory's father, Tom, watches a car drive straight into a deep lake and sink to the bottom with a passenger inside. Tom jumps in and tries to save the driver of the car, only to discover that the man is actually a murder victim. This vision, and the realization that there is evil in the small town of Zephyr, is enough to haunt Cory's father. Meanwhile, Cory has several adventures with his friends (Johnny, Davy Ray, and Ben), such as flying with their dogs on the last day of school.
