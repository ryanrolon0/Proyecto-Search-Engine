After having been berated by a Judge, Mike Hammer goes for a walk and comes across a terrified woman and her pursuer. He kills the man but the woman, terrified, jumps to her death from a bridge. Each possessed an oddly shaped green card, a clue that Hammer pursues. His friend in the police, Pat Chambers, identifies them as membership cards for the local Communist Party. Mike attends a meeting and is mistaken for a spy from Moscow. At the same time, the FBI are searching for some lost secret papers and the career of a popular politician is threatened.
