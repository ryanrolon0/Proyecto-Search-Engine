A team of web developers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula build a city-based social networking website for a small community. The system becomes a big hit, but the team is then asked to build something much larger: an Internet portal that will be monitored in Big Brother fashion by the United States government. While the group mulls its options, the members become engrossed in personal issues. Matt Severson, the owner of The Developers, is constantly chasing after Katy Terrill, a Developer and recent divorcee. Drew Davis, an original co-founder of the group, spends much of his free time as a world-renowned bingo caller. The youngest Developer, Kevin Gentry, often confuses his feelings of love for women with his appetite for fast food. Lastly, Sarina Metcalfe appears to have a fetish for Richard Simmons, while often wearing skimpy clothing during runs in subzero temperatures.
