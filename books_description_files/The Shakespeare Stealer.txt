Fourteen-year-old Widge is an orphan who doesn't even know his real name. Widge's previous master, a clergyman named Dr. Timothy Bright, taught him charactery, a shorthand language, to steal other preachers' sermons. His new master wants to use Widge's shorthand to acquire William Shakespeare's Hamlet, which hasn't been reprinted yet, for himself. Widge is given the assignment to write the play out in shorthand and sets off to London with a companion named Falconer. Falconer is a ruthless man, who is given the job of making sure that the deed is accomplished. During the play performance, Widge is so caught up in the play that before long, all he wants is to know what happens in the play. When he returns for a second try, his notebook is stolen. Widge comes back, posing as a hopeful player. He is accepted into the Lord Chamberlain's Men and, for the first time, feels like a part of a family. However, Falconer constantly presses Widge to steal the play, and Widge must decide between his master and the company.
