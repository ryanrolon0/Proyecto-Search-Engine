The story covers the last few days of term before Christmas for the students of Johann-Sigismund Gymnasium The main characters are Martin, the first student of the class, Jonathan, an orphan who was adopted by a captain, Matz, Uli and Sebastian, students from the Tertia (Year 8). There is a bitter struggle between the students at the Gymnasium and another school, the Realschule. The so-called "Realists" steal their schoolbooks containing their dictations, which the teacher's son (another classmate) was to carry home to his father. This results in a brawl between two champions of each side - Matz and one Wawerka - and a hard-fought snow-ball fight, both of which the six friends win, although they end reported by a student form the Prima (Year 13) for being late back to school. As a "punishment" they are stripped one afternoon off, to be spent with their amiable house teacher Justus at his office (coffee and cake included) where he tells them a story about his own youth and his struggle with inaccessible wardens from Prima. Other parts of the plot include: the friends playing a drama called the Flying Classroom written by Johnny and the friendship to the "Nonsmoker" (a former doctor who lives in an scrapped non-smoker railway compartment and smokes very much, and works as a pub piano player) and the Nonsmoker's own friendship to Justus (who are reunited by the boys). When Uli, the smallest boy who is often called a coward, decides at this time to attempt something which will remove his reputation as a coward. His best friend, Matz, has in the past encouraged him, until he sees Uli about to run off a gym ladder using an umbrella as a parachute. Uli crashes and falls unconscious. Justus and the Nonsmoker (who upon this reenters his medical profession as school doctor) allay their fears that he is dead, but that he has a broken leg.
