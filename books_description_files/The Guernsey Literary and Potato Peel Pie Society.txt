The book is an epistolary novel, whose main character is a female newspaper columnist. She receives a letter from a Channel Island man who has acquired a book (Essays of Elia) which contains her name and (previous) London address on the flyleaf. He writes to her, asking for help in finding a biography of English essayist Charles Lamb, and mentions that he is a member of the Island's only book club. Intrigued both by the man's love of Mr Lamb, and by the intriguing name of the book club, she enters into a correspondence with the man, which leads to an ever-growing web of letters, then a visit to the island, which ends in a permanent residence there. As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact which the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.
