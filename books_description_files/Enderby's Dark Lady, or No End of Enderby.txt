The aging poet has been hired to write the libretto for a musical about William Shakespeare and relocates to the fictional Indiana town of Terrebasse. He must work with collaborators who seem more interested in crude show-biz entertainment than Enderby's intricately rhymed Elizabethan-style verses, and the show's backer - the ostentatious local matron, Mrs. Schoenbaum. The co-star, in the Dark Lady role, is the lusciously black pop-diva April Elgar--and Enderby, consumed with lust, is soon tailoring the show to her non-Elizabethan talents. April is a well-educated daughter of a Carolinian family and is not unresponsive to Enderby's infatuation. She invites Enderby to her home for Christmas, where he must pose as a clergyman, preaching an incoherent sermon to a Baptist congregation. Eventually, the opening night of 'Actor on his Ass' - as the show is now titled - arrives and Enderby is forced to take over the role of Shakespeare. Although Anatole Broyard of The New York Times considered the book funny and clever, he concluded that it was "not as good as the previous three books."
