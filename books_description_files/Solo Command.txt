Wraith Squadron is once again tasked with destroying Warlord Zsinj. This time, they are assigned to General Han Solo, who is heading up the New Republic task force that is seeking Zsinj. At the same time, Face, who has just been promoted to Brevet Captain and given command of the squad, delves deeper into the history of Lara Notsil, finding out her secret and forcing her to abandon the group, though she would later help out the New Republic by creating an army of saboteur droids to cripple the flagship of the warlord. At the end of the book Wraith Squadron is absorbed into the New Republic Intelligence and Myn Donos, newly recovered from his depression, transfers to Rogue Squadron.
