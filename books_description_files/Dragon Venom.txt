Arlian has discovered how to kill the dragons, he now faces an all-out war between dragons and humans. The Dragon Society is split between those loyal to the dragons and those loyal to themselves. Arlian's quest for vengeance will find many secrets of the past, including the origins of the dragons greatest foes...the gods. He gives dragon venom to his stewards wife who is carrying a child. She becomes a dragonheart (a human carrying a baby dragon) and her baby becomes a god. To protect the new born god Arlian battles the dragons killing the three dragons who killed his family and turned him into a dragon heart. He becomes badly injured by dragon venom (the only substance that can harm a dragonheart) so mages cut open his heart and remove the dragon within him. He then awakens to find the young god has healed him and at long last ends his quest for vengeance. At the end of the story Arlian is joined by his closest friends and for the first time in a long time feels the emotion of love.
