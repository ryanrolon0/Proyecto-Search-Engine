Grdankl the Strong, president of Krpshtskan, is plotting to take over the American government. Unfortunately, that is hard considering the fact that Kprshtskan is so poor its airplane motto is "If it is going up it is coming down in a different place." So he sends one of his sons, Prmkt, into America to try and bring it to its knees. Prmkt eventually devises a plan that requires top-secret military technology. To obtain this technology, he enters Hubble Middle School. A science fair is held each year in Hubble Middle School, with a cash prize for the winner, so Prmkt sends notes to the ME (Manor Estates) kids, saying that for a fee, he will give them blueprints to build technical items. However, the ME kids are unaware of who writes these notes or gives the blueprints. Also, considering the fact that some of them have an IQ that can be compared to that of a horsefly, they go to a certain store in the mall called the Science Nook, where the owner, Sternabite, builds their projects for a fee. These procedures are kept secret, otherwise their projects would be disqualified from the science fair. Many people, teachers and students alike, are suspicious of these things, but due to lack of evidence, and the fact that the ME kid's parents are very powerful and are rich, so the ME kids continue to win year after year. Toby Harbinger, an average, smart kid (as noted when he was put in the Gifted Class) has a problem. His problem is that he sold his dad's autographed Han Solo blaster prop to a guy named D. Arthur Vaderian who has a partner who wears polarized sunglasses. He used the $2,038 to buy a new gaming computer, to replace the old one. His father defeats Vaderian in a light-saber duel after Toby escapes from jail with his iPhone that makes him invisible unless someone is wearing polarized sunglasses. One of the funniest and most often repeated lines in the book is "Smerk?", which is used to repel wolves.
