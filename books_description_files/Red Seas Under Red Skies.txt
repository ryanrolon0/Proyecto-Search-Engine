Escaping from the attentions of the Bondsmagi, Locke Lamora, the erstwhile Thorn of Camorr, and Jean Tannen have fled their home city. Taking a ship, they arrive in the city state of Tal Verrar, where they are soon planning their most spectacular heist yet: they will take the luxurious gaming house, the Sinspire, for all of its countless riches. No one has ever taken even a single coin from the Sinspire that wasn't won on the tables or in the other games of chance on offer there. Locke and Jean soon find themselves co-opted into an attempt to bring the pirate fleet of the notorious Zamira Drakasha to justice. This is unusual work for thieves who don't know one end of a galley from another. All the while, the Bondsmagi are plotting their revenge against Locke, the one man who has humiliated them and lived.
