The Brides of March is a bride’s eye view of same-sex marriage at a moment’s notice, with a bevy of brides, their coterie of children, donuts, newspaper reporters, screaming protesters, mothers of the brides who never thought they’d see the day, white wedding cake, and a houseful of happy heterosexuals toasting the marriage! But that was only the beginning as these private declarations of love became public fodder, fueling social commentary, letters to the editor, and the fires of political debate, when all The Brides of March wanted was the opportunity to say, “I do,” in this candid, poignant and frequently funny tale of lesbian moms getting to the church on time in Multnomah County.
