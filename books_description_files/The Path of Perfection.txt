The book presents the essence of Ostad Elahi’s philosophy. Bahram Elahi sets forth the major aspects of a system of thought which aims at bringing out the conditions of man’s process toward perfection by dealing with subjects such as the specificity of human beings, the consequences of our actions, etc. As mentioned in the Preface, this work has been conceived as a concise and practical handbook. The principles stated and the resulting concepts are developed and analysed more thoroughly by the author in other books.
