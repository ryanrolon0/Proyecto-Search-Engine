The principal characters are: Ingrey, who received a wolf spirit in childhood and spends most of the story discovering how, why and to what effect; Ijada, who receives a leopard spirit in a bungled rite; and Wencel, who has extended his life for centuries by taking over the bodies of others, mainly his own descendants, for a purpose that is finally revealed. Ingrey is sent by his lord to take custody of Ijada, who has killed an heir to the kingdom, and bring her to the capital. During their journey, Ingrey learns of the circumstances of the death and does his best to protect Ijada. They become entangled in Wencel's grand plan, which is finally nearing fruition. In the end, Ijada and Ingrey together defeat him and marry at the plot's resolution.
