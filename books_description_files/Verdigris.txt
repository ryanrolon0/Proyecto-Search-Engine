Orbiting above London is a mysterious ship, a duplicate of the St. Pancras railway station. The Doctor, with the aid of the adventurerer, Iris Wildthyme bargains to stop creatures determined to infiltrate the 1970s in the guise of characters from nineteenth century novels. The Doctor is cut off from many of his friends and allies. Iris and her companion Tom reappear in the audio adventures Wildthyme at Large and The Devil in Ms Wildthyme, and the anthology Wildthyme on Top. Iris Wildthyme would later be played in Big Finish audio dramas by Katy Manning, who played Jo Grant in Doctor Who.
