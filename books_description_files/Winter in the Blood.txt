The novel, set in contemporary times, features a self-destructive narrator undergoing an identity crisis. He lives in a Native American reservation in Montana. His tribe and his culture are clashing with a nearby white settlement and misguided legislation. He moves through his days in a mental haze and tries to console himself with sexual encounters. He attempts to deal with the memories of his father found dead in a snowdrift and blames himself for his elder brother's fatal accident at the age of fourteen.
