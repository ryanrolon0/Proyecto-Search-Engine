Bloodstone Pass combines a role-playing scenario with Battlesystem combat. In the plot, the player characters are hired to organize the defense of the town of Bloodstone Pass against an army of orcs, goblins, giants. The army also included human renegades led by a powerful assassin. The module's action focuses on leading the armies rather than having the battle occur in the background while the players adventure to find a MacGuffin.
