Bertie Wooster and Gussie Fink-Nottle swap their identities, while Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright pretends to be the faux-Gussie's valet Meadowes and Jeeves pretends to be the faux-Bertie's valet, before complications ensue. Together, they find themselves at the Aunt-ridden Deverill Hall, Hampshire, seat of the imposing Dame Daphne Winkworth, where Gussie's on-off engagement to Madeline Bassett is once again in danger, leaving Bertie at risk of becoming reattached to her. Bertie must also defend his friend Catsmeat's girl Gertrude Winkworth, daughter of Dame Daphne, from the attentions of the attractive Esmond Haddock, while avoiding fulfilling his Aunt Agatha's wish that he marry her himself... All of Jeeves' considerable powers are required to bring things to a satisfactory conclusion. The story was adapted during the 1990-1993 British TV series Jeeves and Wooster (episode #15 "Right Ho! Jeeves", fourth of season three, aired 19 April 1992 in the UK). The story contains a synopsis of Mervyn Keene, Clubman which is the most complete example of the works of Rosie M. Banks ever given in the works of Wodehouse. Its recitation by Madeline Basset leaves hearer Bertie Wooster in a state of dazed horror. At the time of writing there was bad blood between Wodehouse and fellow author A. A. Milne. The book included several satirical jibes aimed at Milne, for instance after Bertie (pressured by Madeline Basset) agrees to recite Christopher Robin poems at the village concert, he laments: "A fellow who comes on a platform and starts reciting about Christopher Robin going hoppity-hoppity-hop (or alternatively saying his prayers) does not do so from sheer wantonness but because he is a helpless victim of circumstances beyond his control."
