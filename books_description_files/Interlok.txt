The story in the novel was set in Penang in the early 1900s during the colonisation of Britain over Malaya. The story is told from the point of view of three main characters, namely, Seman, Chin Huat and Maniam. The title of the book derived its name from the English word "interlock" which corresponds with the interlocking of the lives of the three main characters of the novel in the final chapter.
