The book's main character is Eulalia, a young daughter of an abolitionist from New England, and the wife of a plantation owner named Moreland. At first indoctrinated by her father's views on Abolitionism, Eulalia initially condemns her husband's use of slaves on his plantation - even though he is behaving benignly towards them - but soon realises how well off Moreland's slaves truly are. As time passes, Eulalia also discovers a plot by a group of local abolitionists to stage a large-scale slave rebellion, with aims to "free" the otherwise-content slaves of the plantation, and to murder both Moreland and Eulalia, despite their kindness to their slaves.
