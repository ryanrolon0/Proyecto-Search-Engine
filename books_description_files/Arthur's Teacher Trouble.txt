Arthur starts a new year with Mr. Ratburn, and is given heaps of homework because Mr. Ratburn is very strict, D. W is ecstatic because she has not started school yet, and she knows that next year, she won't get any homework because the kindergarten teacher is nice. The principal announces the annual September Spellathon, and not long after Mr. Ratburn announces a spelling test to determine which two students will represent his class at the spellathon. Everybody studies, and Arthur and Brain get all twenty words right, and enter into the spellathon. On the night of the spellathon, Arthur is very nervous. Brain is first, and spells 'fear' "F-E-R-E", Prunella falls out not long after, spelling 'preparation' "P-R-E-P-E-R-A-T-I-O-N". Arthur spells preparation correctly and wins the spellathon. At the end of the spellathon, Mr. Ratburn announces that he has loved teaching third grade, but that he is looking forward to a new challenge next year, teaching kindergarten. At this announcement, D.W. faints.
