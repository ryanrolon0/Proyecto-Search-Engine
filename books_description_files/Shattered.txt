Artist Alex Doyle and his new family, bride Courtney and her 11 year old brother Colin, are moving from Philadelphia to San Francisco. Courtney's flying out ahead to get the house set up. Alex and Colin are driving there in Alex's new Ford Thunderbird. The cross-country trip starts out as a fun bonding experience, but their car is being tailed by a van; a van driven by a psychopath intent on terrorizing them.
