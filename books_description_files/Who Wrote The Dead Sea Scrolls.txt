Golb states that "Vermes could not possibly have avoided knowing of the financial agreement that facilitated the transfer of photographs" (p.&nbsp;236), and that Vermes' statement of November 8, 1991, "directly contradicted the position taken by him and the [Oxford] Centre in the [London] Times correspondence published three months earlier" (p.&nbsp;237). The chapter also describes how Vermes used the media "to promote his support for the traditional Essene hypothesis," but showed "disdain" for the similar use of the media by Dr. Robert Eisenman to promote a different view (p.&nbsp;241). *# Myth and Science in the World of Qumranology *# The deepening Scrolls Controversy *# The New York Conference and Some Academic Intrigues *# The importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls
