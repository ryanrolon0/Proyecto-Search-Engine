But then while walking through a sleeping coyote brotherhood, Hank steps on Snort's paw, which awakens the whole brotherhood, which plan to eat them. But Hank escapes with his "Priceless corncob," leaving Drover to be eaten. But then Hank realizes that the whole "Priceless Corncob" thing was a curse. So he sacrifices the corncob to save Drover's life. They return to the ranch unnoticed and find another "Priceless Corncob."
