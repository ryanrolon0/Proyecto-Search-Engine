Hutchinson emphasizes the importance that doctors played in the war. One of the major things they have contributed is the decrease in deaths due to disease. In the American Civil War the ratio was five deaths to disease for every one in battle, however during 'The Great War' the ratio was changed to ten deaths in battle for every one to disease. Hutchinson believes that three major points contribute to this protection against infectious disease: inoculations and sanitary measures; surgical skill and hospital organization increasing recovery rate; and the better food provided to soldiers.
