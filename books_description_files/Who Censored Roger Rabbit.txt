Eddie Valiant is a hard-boiled private eye, and Roger Rabbit is a second-banana cartoon character. The rabbit hires Valiant to find out why his employers, the DeGreasy Brothers, the sleazy owners of a cartoon syndicate, have reneged on a promise to give Roger his own strip. Soon after, Roger is mysteriously murdered in his home. His speech balloon, found on the crime scene, indicates his murder was a way of “censoring” the star, who apparently had just heard someone explain the source of his success. Valiant’s search for the killer takes him to a variety of suspects, including Roger’s widow Jessica Rabbit and his former co-star Baby Herman.
