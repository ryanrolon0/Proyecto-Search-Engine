This volume is set in a stock historical setting, so to speak: the universe of the Spirou et Fantasio comic strip, which was a modern setting but with some added specific flavours. Lapinot plays the part of Spirou, while a newly introduced character plays the part of his friend Fantasio. They are both pursuing a gang of mysterious thieves who own a groundbreaking scientific invention, the atom accelerator. fr:L'Accélérateur atomique
