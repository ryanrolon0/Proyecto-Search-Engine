The play tries to revisit history by portraying a stout and space consuming Sango, as a leader mindful of the wishes of the people; in his desire to please them, he set two of his most powerful chiefs against each other. The chiefs, Gbonka and Timi had grown too powerful and were becoming a nuisance to the kingdom. However, the plot ended up dividing his cabinet and many of his advisers, friends and a wife, Oya left him. Shango's friend Mogba, rather than joining the traitors, desired to redeem the battered image of the king. Mogba invoked incantations causing thunder and lightning to damage the homes of Sango's enemies.
