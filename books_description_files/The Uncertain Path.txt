Obi-Wan Kenobi has left the Jedi Order because of a civil war on the planet of Melida/Daan. He's now part of the Young and he is content with the decision. But soon everything goes wrong; once the Young unite the two factions, they start to fight amongst themselves. In the crossfire, Obi-Wan's close friend, Cerasi, is killed, and Obi-Wan feels alone. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan's former Jedi master, discovers a plot to destroy the Jedi Temple. While investigating, he receives notice that Obi-Wan wishes to rejoin the order. Qui-Gon knows that Obi-Wan would be an asset to the investigation at the temple, so he decides to return and bring his ex-apprentice back to the Jedi Order. The Young cease their internal struggle, and they succeed in uniting the Melida and the Daan under one government. With his task completed, Obi-Wan returns to the Jedi upon Qui-Gon's return. However, he is not immediately welcomed with open arms, for the Temple plot thickens when an assassination attempt is made on Yoda.
