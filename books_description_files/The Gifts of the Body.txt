The book is divided into ten short stories, the titles associated with "gifts" which are various functions of the body, both physical and emotional. These gifts are (in order of the stories) sweat, wholeness, tears, skin, hunger, mobility, death, speech, sight, hope, and mourning. Each of these "gifts" are experienced by the caregiver. The caregiver deals with various patients who have AIDS, showing the different relationships that they share, whether they be good or bad. The patients themselves are different from one another in terms of age, financial situation, attitude towards the illness, etc., showing the reader that this disease can/does affect all types of people.
