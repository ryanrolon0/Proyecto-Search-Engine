On the remote Scottish island of Skua, Perdita has been branded "the witch's daughter" by islanders. They believe her mother died cursing the sea on which they depend for their livelihood. She lives alone in a tumbledown house by the loch, never goes to school, and has no friends. One summer Janey, who is blind, and her brother Tim visit the island with their naturalist father. The children befriend the lonely girl, and together they search for rare orchids, explore the island caves, investigate a crime, and find treasure.
