Ever Bloom is a girl that has psychic abilities. Ever since her parents and little sister Riley died in an accident long ago, she has been able to see people's auras, read thoughts, and even know the contents of a book with a touch, along with a person's history. She is known as a freak throughout her school, until Damen Auguste transfers from New Mexico. He's gorgeous, sweet and can do things a normal person cannot. But that's not what attracts her. What attracts her is that Damen has no visible aura, and she cannot read his thoughts.
