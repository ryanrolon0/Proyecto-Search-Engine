In the Jungle of Nool, a jungle environment populated by anthropomorphic fauna, an elephant named Horton encounters a clover inhabited by a society of tiny beings known as the "Whos" of microscopic size. After conversing with the mayor of Whoville, Horton decides to dedicate all of his time to tending to the needs of the Whos and guarding them from the hazards of the much larger world. However, the Sour Kangaroo, doubting Horton's stories of the Whos, encourages all of the other animals that Horton is lying, and they decide to destroy the clover out of contempt. The terrified, panicking Whos are left to despair until town's mayor stumbles upon a young boy named Jojo, whose mouth he raises a megaphone to just as the animals are about to bring devastation upon all of Whoville. Jojo screams the word "YOPP!!", which is amplified by the megaphone in the nick of time. Realizing that her suspicions were incorrect, the Sour Kangaroo redeems herself by joining Horton in devoting all of her time to protecting the Whos.
