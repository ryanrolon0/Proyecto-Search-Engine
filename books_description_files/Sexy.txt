Sexy follows the character of Darren Flynn, a sixteen-year-old high school student and swim club member that questions his own sense of self and sexuality. When a teacher catches one of Darren's swim team members plagiarizing, that member is thrown off of the team. This prompts several other students to anonymously accuse the teacher of hitting on boys, which ruins the teacher's life. Darren chose not to take part in the accusations but is now torn between his moral objections and his fear of being thought of in the same light.
