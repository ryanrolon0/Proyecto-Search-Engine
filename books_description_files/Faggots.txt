The main character, Fred Lemish, is loosely modeled on Kramer. Lemish wants to find a loving, long-term relationship. But his urges are frustrated and he becomes disillusioned with the 1970s "fast lane" lifestyle that dominates the gay subculture in and around New York, as he stumbles through an emotionally cold series of glory holes, bathhouses, BDSM encounters and group sex. Lemish also expresses discomfort with the widespread use of multiple street and prescription drugs that helped to maintain the party atmosphere. Faggots details the use of over two dozen 1970s party drugs and intoxicants such as Seconal, poppers, LSD, Quaaludes, alcohol, marijuana, Valium, PCP, cocaine and heroin. Locales include Fire Island, a gay bathhouse called the "Everhard," and a club called the Toilet Bowl.
