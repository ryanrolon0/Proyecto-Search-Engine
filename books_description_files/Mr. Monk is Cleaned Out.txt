During a financial crisis, the San Francisco police department fires Adrian Monk as a consultant. Natalie Teeger learns that Monk invested his life savings with Bob Sebes, an investor who has just been arrested on charges of orchestrating a $100 million fraud. The key witness in the Sebes case is murdered, leaving Monk to consider him the prime suspect, except Sebes is under house arrest with constant guard and continuous media scrutiny.
