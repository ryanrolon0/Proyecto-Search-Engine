The book begins in 2012, after NASA has announced its intent to hold a contest for teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18. Three winners will be selected from all over the world, with the prize being a coveted spot on an upcoming mission to return to the moon. The stunt is believed to be a way of increasing both funding and public interest, but the real reason is that NASA intends to study a mystical phenomenon that was previously discovered during the original moon landing. This is the reason that NASA stopped sending people to the moon back in the seventies and that this phenomenon has a sinister edge to it. Three teenagers from Norway, Japan, and France are excited at the rare opportunity to see the moon firsthand as well as stay in the formerly secret lunar base DARLAH 2, but that excitement is short lived as they realize that this base might become their tomb.
