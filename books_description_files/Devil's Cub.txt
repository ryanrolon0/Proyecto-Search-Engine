The son of the Duke and Duchess of Avon, the Marquis of Vidal is known as Devil's Cub not only for the excesses of his father but for his own wild habits. As he is paying court to a girl of the bourgeoisie, Sophia Challoner, he also participates in a rather impromptu duel, the outcome of which forces him to leave the country. He intends to bring Sophia with him as his mistress: but her strait-laced sister Mary has no intention of allowing her sister to be ruined, and takes her place, assuming that the Marquis will let her go once the mistake is discovered, leaving him with no chance to take Sophia afterwards. But she has not yet obtained the measure of the Marquis's personality, for in the grip of fury he takes Mary off with him instead, and only when they are in France and it is too late for either to turn back does he realise that by abducting a respectable girl he has compromised her and is obliged to offer her marriage. However, Mary refuses Vidal because she believes he is making the offer from guilt and as she has fallen in love with him she finds this intolerable. In her misery, she runs away, intending to seek her own fortune. While away, she meets Vidal's father, the Duke of Avon, by chance, and takes him into her confidence without realising that she is talking to Avon - who is an old crony of her grandfather's and has come to France to investigate the rumours surrounding his son and scotch any scandal. The two reach an excellent understanding, with Avon clearly coming to respect Mary. Vidal pursues, and ultimately realizes he loves her, persuading her to marry him - in spite of Avon's dry observation that she could do better. Heyer's An Infamous Army is a sequel to Devil's Cub. {| class="wikitable" |- !These Old Shades !Devil’s Cub |- |Justin Alastair, Duke of Avon |Justin Alastair, Duke of Avon |- |Léonie de Saint-Vire |Léonie (de Saint-Vire) Alastair, Duchess of Avon |- |Lady Fanny (Alastair) Marling |Lady Fanny (Alastair) Marling |- |Edward Marling |Mr. John Marling (son of Edward Marling, now deceased) |- |Lord Rupert Alastair |Lord Rupert Alastair |- |Harriet (Alastair) Field |Harriet (Alastair) Field |- |Mr. Hugh Davenant |Mr. Hugh Davenant |}
