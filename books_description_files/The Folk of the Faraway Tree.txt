Jo, Bessie and Fanny (or Joe, Beth and Frannie) have Connie over to stay because her mother is sick. Connie is stuck up and bossy and does not believe in magic. She says that Dick (or Rick) told her all about his stay in the country. The children are overwhelmed because it does not seem like Dick/Rick to tell stories. She calls the Enchanted Wood silly, the Faraway Tree ridiculous, Moonface, Dame Washalot and Mr Watizisname stupid, Saucepan Man mad and says that magic is made up and old fashioned. The three children get mad at her for calling their friends rude names and old fashioned. After she arrives, Moonface comes. Connie does not believe that Moonface is real so he tells her to think that it is a dream. Connie soon believes them and has a wonderful time in the country. She then regrets that she has to leave. They have a wonderful time with Connie although she does lead to trouble like going up to the Land of Marvels and climbing up the Ladder That Has No Top. Good thing Moonface saves her. Another time she listens to some else's secret in the Land of Secrets. Mrs Hidden takes away her voice and the children have to get it back. Luckily, the Land of Enchantments comes after The Land of Secrets leaves. Lastly, Connie's third mistake is mistaking Dame Slap (or Snap) for Mrs Saucepan (Saucepan's mother, who is the cook at Dame Slap's school). In the end, they all have to join Dame Slap's school except Fanny and Bessie who have to help out in the kitchen because Mrs Saucepan quits when Saucepan arrives. They are rescued by Saucepan who arrived earlier and was walking around with his mother.
