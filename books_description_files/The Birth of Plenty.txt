The Birth of Plenty is an history of the world expressed in economic terms. Bernstein argues that in order to prosper, a country must possess four main attributes: property rights, the scientific method, capitalism and an effective communications infrastructure. After establishing these as the basic requirements for economic success, the book examines the historical progress of a number of countries both with and without these attributes. Bernstein further argues that the four attributes are a necessary precursor to democracy.
