Anna Madrigal's "logical" children have fledged from 28 Barbary Lane and she rattles around with her new brood until a Greek holiday and a romance whisk her away. Her daughter Mona Ramsey, now a Lady, wanders back in from the cold and briefly warms her toes in the sands of Lesbos. Michael (not often referred to as Mouse any more) Tolliver is settled with his lover Thack in their own house in Noe Valley. Having tested positive for HIV, he is coming to terms with his anticipated short time left. Brian Hawkins has given up his tomcat ways to settle down as 'house husband' and chief caretaker of adopted daughter, Shawna (aka Puppy). With Michael, he is co-owner of Plant Parenthood, a gardening nursery. Then there's Mary Ann Singleton. Ambitious and even more beautiful, she is now a TV talk show host famous in the San Francisco area. She is offered a once-in-a-lifetime job as the host of a nationally syndicated show - in New York! Mary Ann, who started the whole series and introduced us to the beauty and excitement of the Tales world, tears the band apart. The ingenue, naif, every person who wriggled into our affections by also mispronouncing Beauchamp, "BoShomp", and noticing the sprinklers on the ceiling, calls the party over and breaks our hearts.
