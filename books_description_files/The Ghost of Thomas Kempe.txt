James Harrison and his family move into a small cottage in a village called Ledsham. From the first day they are disturbed by incidents that are caused by a ghost called Thomas Kempe, James eventually learns. In life Kempe had been a 17th-century cunning man ("sorcerer") and now he wants to resume work. He attacks people whose work usurps his place, such as the village doctor, nurse, policemen, and pharmacist. He is also vicious regarding the vicar, but most dangerous regarding Mrs Verity whom he believes to be a witch. Kempe tries to make James his apprentice and James is blamed for many of the incidents. The Harrisons are among those who do not believe in ghosts or sorcery, so they blame James for a long time. The boy tries both alone and with outside help to resolve the situation but there is no way out until Kempe determines that the modern world is not for him.
