The main content of the book describes the disease that would later cause a global catastrophe: H5N1, the bird flu. In parts of southeastern Asia, the bird flu is a deadly epidemic that is feared by many. The bird flu has already spread to parts of Africa and most of Europe, because of today's transportation methods. Pandemia illustrates the possibility that bird flu will possibly mutate and spread to the rest of the world, creating a global pandemic in a matter of weeks. This causes a global state of emergency, and eventually causes the collapse of society and many economies across the world. The book's full plot features a group of teens in Saline, Michigan that must try and escape the city and head to the countryside where they can hopefully stay alive long enough in their uncle's cabin to be rescued. But in doing so, the teens must use whatever weapons they can find to defend themselves against looters, insane killers, and contagious, potentially dangerous infected. In a world gone mad, can the group find the necessities: food, water and shelter to survive?
