In 2003, a box was discovered in Sweden that contained a journal, letters, and old glass-plate negatives which belonged to Algot Sättersröm. They told a story dating back to 1903, when Algot left Sweden to live in Egypt and Jerusalem. The material was discovered by photographer Mattias Sättersröm, Algot's great-grandson. After reading the journal, letters and printing from the glass-plates Mattias decided to follow in Algot's footsteps. He enlisted the help of friend and photographer, Mark Smith to collaborate on the project and landed in Alexandria one hundred years to the day after Algot arrived.
