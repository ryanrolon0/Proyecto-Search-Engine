The book involves several young boys and girls and their role in assisting the Partisans in fighting the Germans invading Yugoslavia during World War II. There are allusions throughout to mythology such as the children's fear of the drekavac (monster) which they are told lives in the forest. The children are forced to conquer their supposed fear in order to assist the Partisans.
