For a hundred generations the worlds of Rutan and Senali have temporarily exchanged their heirs to the throne as a cultural learning experience. Now, one of the heirs does not want to come back to his planet and a war is going to happen. Only Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn can assist the planet. While trying to balance the peace between the two factions, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are nearly killed by a terrorist group, doublecrossed multiple times, and imprisoned by the people they are trying to assist. In the end, the peace between Rutan and Senali is re-established.
