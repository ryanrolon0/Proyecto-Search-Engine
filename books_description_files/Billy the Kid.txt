The book is set during World War II. It is about a boy called Billy who grew up with his hobby, football, and wanted to play for the Chelsea football team. Then his mother gave birth to his brother, Joe, who later in the story joined the army at the beginning of the Second World War. Soon afterwards, his parents receive a message that Joe has died. This happened at Dunkirk on the French coast when the Germans advanced, routing the British army. Winston Churchill urged the sending of as many boats possible of all sizes for the evacuation. 250,000 were rescued; the rest were killed (there was approximately 300,000 allies). The family were depressed to hear the disappointing news. Billy later decides to join the army, fight for his country, and then succeed in the war. He survives to become a player for Chelsea Football Club and then into old age. BBM pin - 2878235A
