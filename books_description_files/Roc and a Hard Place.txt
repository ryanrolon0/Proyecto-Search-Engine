One year after the events of Geis of the Gargoyle, Demoness Metria, whilst making her husband Veleno deliriously happy, finds that the stork will not acknowledge her summons. Seeking to summon the stork, Metria (and her worser half, D. Mentia) are sent on a quest by the Good Magician Humphrey. Metria is then given a task by the Simurgh: Deliver a bag's worth of summons to their respective citizens of Xanth in order to hold a trial for Roxanne Roc. All that remains is to find out why Roxanne Roc is being held trial as Metria meets with many old Xanth characters, Grundy Golem, Sorceress Iris, Magician Trent, Gray Murphy, Jordan the Barbarian, Desiree Dryad, and many more!
