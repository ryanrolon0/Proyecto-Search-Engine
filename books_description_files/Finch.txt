At the time of Finch, Ambergris is ruled by the gray caps, a non-human, "spore-based" species. Their "Rising" followed a destructive civil war between rival human factions. The title character, reluctant detective John Finch, is tasked with investigating a double-murder, one victim a human and the second a gray cap.
