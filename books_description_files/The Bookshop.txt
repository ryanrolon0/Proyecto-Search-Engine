The location chosen is the Old House, an abandoned, damp house said to be infested by ghosts. With many sacrifices, the business starts and grows for about a year, after which sales slump. Florence Green has a contention with the influential Mrs Gamart, who wanted to set up an arts centre in the Old House.

Eventually also the Old House is purchased and Florence Green evicted.
