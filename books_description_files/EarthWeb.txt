EarthWeb is set in a future where Earth is attacked roughly every five years by spaceships from an unknown extraterrestrial society. Named Shivas, after the Hindu Deity of the same name, the ships are very large, and become progressively more advanced. The ultimate goal of the ships seems to be the complete destruction of the Earth. A commando squad of highly trained soldiers, called Angels, work to destroy the ship, using information gathered by an extended, worldwide version of the internet.
