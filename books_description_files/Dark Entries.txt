The plot of the novel involves John Constantine being convinced to enter a reality television program which has suffered several strange hauntings, a thinly veiled satire of British programmes Most Haunted and Big Brother. This turns out to be not a television programme made for humanity, but for the denizens of Hell, and John must work out a way to escape from this.
