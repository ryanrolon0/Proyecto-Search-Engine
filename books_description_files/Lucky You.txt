Lucks intends to use the winnings to purchase a block of land to protect the animals by preventing it from being developed into a mall. Before she is able to do this the ticket is stolen by two white supremacist thugs, who have the other winning lottery ticket, but don't think that Lucks deserves to hold onto hers. The story revolves around her efforts to recover the ticket, aided by a newspaper reporter. The book parodies paranoid militia groups that believe in somewhat bizarre conspiracy theories. It also takes a satiric look at vendors in the fictional community of Grange, Florida, (based on the real community of Cassadaga) who proclaim various religious miracles. One character in the book drills holes in his palms to make it appear that he has the stigmata. There is also a woman who worships the "Road-Stain Jesus," which then becomes another tourist attraction. <!-- comment out empty section after 2 years
