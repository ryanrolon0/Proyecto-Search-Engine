The novel opens with the invasion of the Korean Demilitarized Zone by North Korea. Next is the phone call from Russian General Yuri Razov to U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Andrew Thomas, informing him of Russia's intent to recapture land lost to China in a previous conflict. The beginning of this invasion will be the use of tactical nuclear weapons to clear the way for the army. Meanwhile, a radical Russian general, Zorin, seizes control of the Stavka and gains access to Russia's nuclear launch codes. As China retaliates against Moscow, Zorin launches a counterforce nuclear strike against the U.S. missile silos, bomber bases, submarine pens, and command centers. The U.S. responds in kind, and though no cities in either country were intentionally targeted in the exchange, roughly four to seven million people are killed. A political crisis erupts as war is declared and President Walter Livingston is impeached. The novel follows Greg Lambert, the National Security Advisor to the President, in the inner governmental circles as the war begins and the Vice President is sworn in. The United States Army Reserves are called up, and Major David Chandler reports to March AFB in California, leaving behind his pregnant wife Melissa, an attorney. As the novel follows him from his leave to his assignment as a tank battalion commander, Melissa gives birth and deals with fallout and fear back home. The novel proceeds along as conventional war begins as NATO is dissolved, and the U.S. and its new allies begin the invasion of Eastern Europe and Russia. Marines land in eastern Russia and push west. But Russia has not launched all of her nuclear weapons, and threatens to launch submarine-based missiles at the quickly emptying 304-largest U.S. cities. President Paul Constanzo and the joint chiefs must wrestle with the failing economy, failing support, and all-out nuclear war, while the Army continues its advance into the heart of Russia.
