Vectors in three-dimensional space has six chapters, each divided into five or more subsections. The first on linear spaces and displacements including these sections: Introduction, Scalar multiplication of vectors, Addition and subtraction of vectors, Displacements in Euclidean space, Geometrical applications. The second on Scalar products and components including these sections: Scalar products, Linear dependence and dimension, Components of a vector, Geometrical applications, Coordinate systems. The third on Other products of vectors. The last three chapters round out Chisholm's integration of these two largely independent developments.
