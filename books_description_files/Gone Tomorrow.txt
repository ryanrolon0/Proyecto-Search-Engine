It's 2am, and Jack Reacher is travelling on the New York underground. He notices a suspicious looking passenger, who begins to tick off a majority of entries on his mental list for finding suicide bombers. When he approaches her, he says he can help but she commits suicide by shooting herself. NYPD are eager to close the file without investigating the night's events, but Reacher has other ideas. He wants to know what happened that night, and more importantly why. Is everyone as honest as they claim to be? And if so, then why are there so many questions asked, or avoided? Reacher is advised to walk away, but of course this is not an option. He's fallen down the rabbit hole, but the question is: whose hole is it? And where does it land?
