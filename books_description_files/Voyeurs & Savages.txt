Meynard, during his research on Philippine-American relations, was able to produce historical documents – an assemblage of articles, letters, pamphlets, brochures, e-mails among others. Through these documents, Meynard Aguinaldo was able to "peep" through the lives of other people, whether Filipino or American. Armando Aguinaldo, in turn – in a scene from the novel – secretly watched his nephew Meynard Aguinaldo and the daughter of Cornelius James when the dating couple were copulating inside one of the suites of his beach resort. The ending of the novel presents a scene where Cornelius James and Rowena – the grandfather and the granddaughter – was holding a "storytelling session". The exchange of stories is the bridge that fills the gap between the two people's past and present.
