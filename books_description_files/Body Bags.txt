She lands a job at Somerset Medical Center as a medical examiner's assistant, assisting in paperwork and autopsies. When a congressional aide goes insane and drops dead, the pathology team at Somerset Medical Center discover his brain infested by insect larvae during the autopsy. As more people turn up with the same disease, including one of her teachers, Jenna Blake begins piecing clues together that even the police have been missing, which draws her dangerously close to truth behind the mysterious infections and whoever is behind it.
