Flora, Ruby, Olivia and Nikki are expecting new neighbors to move into Row House number 2, formerly occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Willet. The girls are very much exited to hear that the Hamiltons, the new neighbors, have two children. One of them is Willow and the other is her younger brother, Cole. Willow seems to be a perfect person for the group of friends. But there is a big problem - Willow doesn't seem to want to be friends. But Flora thinks she has a secret and doesn't want to reveal it. This particular secret is obviously related to the erratic and senseless behavior of Mrs. Hamilton, Willow's mother. There are also other things going on in Camden Falls, the little town in Massachusetts. Nikki and a friend at the animal shelter are making a dog parade. Money collected on the parade goes for abandoned dogs. Meanwhile, there's a mystery at Aunt Allie's house. Ruby and Flora had found a closet full of baby's clothes at their aunt's abode. Since Allie hadn't yet married, let alone had a baby, the sisters grow suspicious. The next time, Ruby visits her aunt for a sleepover. She does her part snooping and finds a photograph with an attractive young man, but leaves it as Aunt Allie had caught Detective Ruby in the act. And Olivia also gets a boyfriend. Ruby and her friends Lacey and Hilary are going trick-or-treating. They can't decide what to wear! Flora, Min and Gigi had tailored costumes for the trio - the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty. But then the three girls had changed their minds so often that they ended up wearing costumes as 'Still Life' which was Ruby's idea. Ruby, Lacey and Hilary made these costumes: a bunch of grapes, a banana and a pear. Even though they had very little confidence in these costumes, it turned out to be a big success.
