Mick Devlin, an old "flame" of Nancy Drew's, asks for her support with Nellie Mabo, an Aboriginal local, who is desperate to locate a revered idol, a tjuringa board, and return it back to her clan. The Hardy boys join her in Australia, only to encounter a pair of proprietors keeping an opal mine, a blood-hungry poacher on the verge of creating a new endangered species, a rage fueled clan war over the land, the Australian outback, and a list of suspects.
