"Hekat will be slave to no man..." And thus the first Godspeaker book begins. Hekat, a girl born no better than a slave to an unloving father who beats his wife. Who rapes her on the insistence that she should birth him more sons. Who kills his own flesh and blood when it runs away, and who trades them to strange men for gold. Hekat...sold to slave trader Abajai. Once sold, she begins her journey to Abajai's homeland, Et-Raklion city in the land of Mijak. along the way, Abajai teaches her how to speak, how to dress, and how to sing and dance, and holds her away from the rest of the slaves. Her first love, he treats her as human, until she realizes too late, to him she is just a slave. A pretty slave that with some training will fetch much. Heartbroken, Hekat runs and joins Et-Raklion Warlord's army through the help of the nameless god, and pity to those who stand in her way, because Hekat will not be tamed. Hekat will be slave to no man. She is in the god's eye, precious and beautiful.
