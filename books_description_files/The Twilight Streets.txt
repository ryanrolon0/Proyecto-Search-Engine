Jack Harkness receives a message in 1941 which simply reads "Revenge for the Future". There's a part of the modern city that no one much goes to, a collection of rundown old houses and gloomy streets. No one stays there long, and no one can explain why - something's not quite right there. Even Jack himself seems unable to enter the area, feeling physically ill when he tries. Now the district of Cardiff is being renovated and opened with street parties and entertainers out in force to advertise the new area. All seems well until Toshiko recognises the sponsor of the event: Bilis Manger.
