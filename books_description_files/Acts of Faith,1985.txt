Using the 1983 race riots in Sri Lanka as a background, Acts of Faith explores social and political issues which characterize Sri Lanka and other Asian nations. The book provides a satirical critique of observed state-incited violence, manipulation of the media, caste and class rivalries. At the same time, underneath the racy humor there is a close attention to personal motivations, particularly in terms of the family structures that dominate such societies.
