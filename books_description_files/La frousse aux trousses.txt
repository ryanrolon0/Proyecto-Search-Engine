In La frousse aux trousses, Spirou and Fantasio intend to make a journey to Touboutt-Chan in order to clarify the fate of Adrien Maginot and Günter Siegfried, who disappeared in the 30s while seeking a mythical place in this area of the world, the Valley of the Outlaws. However the two journalists have trouble finding the funds necessary to the achievement of their project. They are then contacted by Doctor Placebo, who is persuaded that frightening experiences are a sure-fire cure for hiccups. He offers the two heroes funding for the trip, on condition that they take along the patients sent to them by the doctor, in the hope that their experiences will prove his theory. Guided by the native Gorpah, the two heroes and their incredible companions are confronted with soldiers, rebels and bad weather. At the climax of the adventure, Spirou and Fantasio are carried away by a torrent of water, leaving the patients cured of their hiccups, but undeniably depressed. <!--
