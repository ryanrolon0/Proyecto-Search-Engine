The war between humanity and Faerie devastated both sides. Nothing has been seen or heard from Faerie since, but in the human world some magic remains embedded in nature. Corn resists being harvested; dandelions have thorns. Trees terrorize villagers, and the town where Liza lives is surrounded by a forest that seems alive and will kill anyone who goes near. But Liza believes her father can protect their town. He does so by electing himself town leader and laying down strict rules, the most important being that any trace of magic must be destroyed, no matter where it is found. Then Liza's sister is born with faerie magic, and Liza's father leaves the baby on a hillside to die. After her mother runs away into the forest, leaving Liza with her abusive father, Liza herself discovers she has the faerie ability to see—into the past, into the future—and she must flee. With a magic shadow following her and an unwanted companion, she will try to journey to the Faerie world.
