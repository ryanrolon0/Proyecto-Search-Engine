Danny is an aging hipster in New York City who has fallen on hard times. He doesn't have a real career and he has a habit of burning bridges with old friends. His cousin Howard presents him with an opportunity to come to eastern Europe and help convert an old castle into an alternative resort. Danny has a troubled relationship with Howard. Many years before, when they were children, he cruelly left Howard stranded deep in a cave for days, traumatizing him badly, and ruining much of his childhood. But Danny is desperate for money so he decides to work for Howard, and travels to the castle, severing his relationships with his New York world. He plunges himself into the strange environment of the castle and puts himself at the mercy of the cousin he betrayed many years before. It soon becomes clear that this castle is a deeply strange place with a dark history that isn't entirely finished. It has secret passages, bizarre inhabitants, and seems to operate by different rules from the outside world. Danny, cut off from his familiar New York world, is unsure whether the castle is haunted or his own perceptions are becoming increasingly distorted. He thinks that his cousin may be out to get him and the castle may be a giant trap. When Danny attempts to escape from the castle he encounters a series of mysterious roadblocks. No matter what he does, fate seems to be directing Danny back to the castle, and towards a final confrontation with his cousin Howard. Together, they end up trapped deep within the bowels of the castle, where they are forced to re-enact the traumas of childhood. Together they must figure out a way to escape and survive.
