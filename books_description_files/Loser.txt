Jerry Spinelli's novel, Loser, takes place in a "small brick-and-hoagie town" in the United States and details the childhood of Donald Zinkoff, focusing on his life from the first through sixth grades. Zinkoff is usually the last person picked for athletic teams, his flute consistently hits the wrong note during concerts, and he is occasionally too eager at the wrong times. Donald Zinkoff is one unusual kid that some people just can't really understand, with uncontrollable laughter, uncommon enthusiasm, the love of going to school, acting childish when supposedly mature, not being good at sports, and a dream of becoming a mailman (after his father). Donald tries to fit in, but has trouble doing so. Even after being called "Loser", he goes on with life and remains happy, even though he doesn't have any friends. However, throughout the book we notice that these traits make him far more of a winner than his peers. Zinkoff is introduced to school in First grade and loves it, even though he is always seated in the rear of the classroom because his teacher sits students alphabetically. But Zinkoff hits his low point in fifth grade, when his team does not want him to participate in that year's field day because of his abysmal performance during last year's proceedings. Sixth grade is Zinkoff's first year of Middle School, where he reconnects with his former neighbor from second grade, Andrew. Andrew has changed his identity to become "Drew," a sixth grader who has confidence in the crowded halls and a cell phone in his book bag. This chance encounter sort of clues Zinkoff in as to how much of a difference there is between him and his peers. Even though they consider him to be a loser, he's not; in fact, Zinkoff has a heart of gold. This is shown through his interactions with his parents and the lonely, elderly lady in his neighborhood, as well as the hours he spends looking for a little girl from his neighborhood who becomes lost in a snowstorm.
