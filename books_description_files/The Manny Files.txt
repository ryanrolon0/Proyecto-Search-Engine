Keats Dalinger, a shy young boy, learns how to be more outgoing and self-confident after his family hires a new "manny" (male nanny). Keats is a small boy who has many troubles at school. He often watches late night TV with his uncle Max and often asks awkward questions or makes sarcastic remarks from the shows to his teacher and his classmates. He most of the time gets sent to the principal for it. The manny is homosexual, it turns out at the end of the novel, when he and Keats' Uncle Max share a kiss.
