The story takes place in a suburb of Chicago called Summit during the 1910s. Two hit men, Max and Al, walk into Henry's lunch-room, which is run by George, and order something off the menu that is not available and have to settle for pork and eggs. Al goes into the kitchen and ties up Nick Adams, a recurring character in Hemingway's stories, and Sam the black cook. Max and George soon have a conversation, which reveals that the two men are there to kill Ole Anderson, a Swedish boxer, for a "friend". Anderson never shows, so the two men leave. George sends Nick to Hirsch's boarding house, run by Mrs. Bell, to warn Anderson about the two men. Nick finds Anderson lying in his bed with all of his clothes on. He tells Anderson what has happened. Anderson does not react, except to tell Nick not to do anything, as there is nothing that can be done. Nick leaves, goes back to the lunch-room, and informs George about Ole Anderson's reaction. When George no longer seems concerned, Nick decides to leave town.
