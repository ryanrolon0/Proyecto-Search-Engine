Maestro Gabriel Atlan-Ferrara, on the eve of his possibly last performance, reflects upon his relationship with Inez Prada. Though the maestro and the diva had only met thrice in their relationship of nearly three decades, the intensity never fades. Their relationship is characterized by mutual admiration, a sense of independence and ego. Parallel to this, a fable of primeval human male and female union (re-union) is also portrayed, and the two streams blend into one at the climax, which is on the border of realism and fantasy. The maestro's favorite work, The Damnation of Faust by Hector Berlioz often comes up as a backdrop as well as a metaphor.
