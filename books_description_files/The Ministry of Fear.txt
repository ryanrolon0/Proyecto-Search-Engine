In London, during the Blitz, Arthur Rowe wins a cake at a charity fête. He doesn't know the cake was given to him by mistake and contains a secret message. From the very moment he takes his prize, Rowe is caught up in an international spy ring acting on behalf of Nazi Germany. The action plays out as bombs pound the city, and who is friend and who foe becomes increasingly uncertain. The novel title was later used by Irish poet Seamus Heaney as a title about his time in school. fa:
