13-year-old Ally lives at a campsite called The Moon Shadow where she is homeschooled by her parents along with her 10-year-old brother Kenny. Although they don't have phone reception and have barely seen any TV in their lives, Ally loves The Moonshadow and her dream is to find one of the Messier Objects. She then discovers that her family is going to move to the city and she will be put in public school. Meanwhile, 13-year-old Bree is the most popular girl in her school and proud of it.

She and her 10-year-old sister, Melanie are going to move to The Moon Shadow and take the place of Ally and her family as the caretakers of the campsite.
