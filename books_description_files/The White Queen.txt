The story follows Elizabeth's life from her first meeting with Edward, through to his death and its aftermath. The mystery of the Princes in the Tower forms part of the action, with the novel questioning whether King Richard III had reason to have the boys killed. In the novel, young Prince Richard is not sent to the tower; Queen Elizabeth instead substitutes a page boy for the prince, who escapes and lives under an assumed name. The novel ends in 1485, just prior to the Battle of Bosworth.
