The Palmer family are going on a trip to the Magpie Islands. During their trip, Mrs. Palmer breaks her ankle and has to leave with Mr. Palmer to go to the hospital in Beaverville, California. They make the decision to leave the kids by themselves. Jonathan and Abby are by themselves when Moose, their dog, starts barking frantically, trying to get Jonathan and Abbys' attention. The ground starts rumbling and shaking. It then starts to pour down rain on them. For Abby, the situation was difficult due to her accident when she was two years old, leaving her legs partially paralyzed. She uses her walker during the day, and she usually crawls at night. Jonathan and Abby are frightened, but Jonathan tells Abby to not worry and that everything is going to be all right. Abby is distressed, but she tries to calm herself by singing some songs that she knows. The earthquake stops, but the water is very high and there are trees down. The kids get on trees so they can stay afloat on the river. Jonathan and Abby then go down the river to see if they could get to shore.
