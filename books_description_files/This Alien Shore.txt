The plot of this book is based in a far-future where interstellar flight caused mutations in the race as a whole. Some were minute differences, some to the point of grotesque. This eventually leads to the cessation of interstellar flight, stranding a majority of the population from their culture and supplies that were rooted on the Earth. This causes worlds to reinvent themselves and some to come out stronger. Eventually, one planet discovers a method of interstellar travel that does not cause the adverse effects. They create a company called the Outspace Guild. Due to the mutations, the Guild is the only one that can use this method of travel, and this quickly becomes a monopoly. Throughout this time, computers have advanced to a point that they are necessary for all facets of life. It is introduced early in the book that each person is entitled to a computer installed at birth. Unfortunately, it is impossible to reinstall different computers due to the complexity of the nervous system and how it so intricately ties into your body. In this future, it is extremely important to make sure that the hardware installed is some of the best. The government in this future have guaranteed that all persons shall be entitled to hardware, but the rich will tend to make sure to upgrade this for their children to guarantee them a better lifestyle. The computers that are integrated into the body can help to regulate bodily functions, such as a regular release of adrenaline at a scheduled time, as well as set up tasks and reminders for the mind. Viruses have become more dangerous as the computer can control your base functions and thus makes you vulnerable to attack on a much different level.
