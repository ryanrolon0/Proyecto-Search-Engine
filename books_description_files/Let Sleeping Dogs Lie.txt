Murder after murder at the chicken house is occurring, and Hank and Drover are beside themselves trying to find just who it is. But all investigating takes a back burner when Hank, out working traffic, sees Beulah and Plato in Billy's pickup. He tries to show off and annoys Billy, which results in him using the truck door to knock this four-legged nuisance over the ditch and "there were five draws to that stupid canyon, and I hit every stinkin' one of 'em" and after a nutty interrogation of Dogpound Ralph, Hank heads home to get bawled out by Loper. After a while he stakes out the chicken house and finds it was a hypnotizing skunk who has been doing the killing. After a brief scare during which Hank is accused of being the killer and is locked up, he breaks away and leaves, and saves Little Alfred from a hooking bull, and Sally May forgives him, and so the story ends.
