Buck Duane is the son of a famous outlaw. Though an outlaw is not always a criminal, if the Rangers say he is an outlaw, its just as bad - he's a hunted man. After killing a man, Duane is forced to 'go on the dodge'. Duane turns up at an outlaw's hideout, still revolting at the idea of outlawry. Worse still, all the men he kills haunt him, for years. At the outlaw hideout, he meets a kidnapped, beautiful young woman and desires to see her free. In the second part of the book, Duane joins the Rangers, who want him to clear the frontier of outlaws, in return for the Govenor's pardon of his illegal deeds. The book takes place in Texas, which is known as the Lone Star State. Buck Duane is made a Texas Ranger toward the end of the novel. The title also highlights the social isolation of the main character. It was adapted as a radio series in 1933.
