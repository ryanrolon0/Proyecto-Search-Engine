Fabulous Histories tells the story of two families -- one robin and one human -- who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the children and the baby robins learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practicing kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to "universal benevolence" as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of eighteenth-century children's literature, “in its depiction of eighteenth-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s Fabulous Histories was the most representative children’s book of the period."
