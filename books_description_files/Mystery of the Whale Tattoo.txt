This story is set in and around Bayport as well as briefly in Mystic Seaport. The boys are hired by a traveling carnival to spot pick-pockets. This ties in well with their other job where the boys try to help their detective father by tracking down the location of an informant trying to sell information about a valuable object that has gone missing. The main lead is that the person has called from a public telephone on the fair grounds. All of their eventual suspects are noted for having tattoos of a whale on them.Chet Morton also uses his new hobby, scrimshaw, to piece up members of the gang.
