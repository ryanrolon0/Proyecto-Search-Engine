Falsehood in War-time identifies the role propaganda plays in World War I, in general and specific terms. Ponsonby states that the book was not written to blame nor expose any individual or authority over another; it was written to inform and disillusion the masses. General ideas of propaganda that nations used were: *Depicting the enemy in a negative light *Provoking patriotism *Exaggerating victories, concealment or minimization of defeats, and the continuous exposure of enemy atrocities in order keep up morale *Asserting that they (the nation) did not want war *Having the information come from “intellectuals and literary notables” Ponsonby lists over 20 different falsehoods that “pretty well cover the ground.” He doesn’t condemn lying during war-time, saying without lying there would be “no reason and no will for war,” and shows how it must (is) be used through his examples and explanations.
