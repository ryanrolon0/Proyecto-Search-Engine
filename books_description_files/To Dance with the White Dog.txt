Sam Peek happily resides in Hart County, Georgia as a pecan farmer and local celebrity featured in many gardening/horticultural magazines. He and his wife Cora are both in their 80's, and have just celebrated their 57th wedding anniversary. Cora dies of a heart attack. Sam and his family are deeply grieved over this, and his daughters begin to obsess over his safety and his life. Not long after Cora's death, a mysterious white dog that only Sam can see appears near the house. He thinks it is just a stray, but daughter Kate and his other children don't see it and think he's going crazy. Even Sam's favorite son James can't see the dog. Nobody believes Sam except Kate's son Bobby. After a series of events, the family begins to see the white dog. The day before Sam's death, the dog disappears, and it is thought the dog was Cora in another form.
