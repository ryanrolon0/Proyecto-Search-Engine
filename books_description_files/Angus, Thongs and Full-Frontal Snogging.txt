The story is told through the journal of a teenage girl named Georgia Nicolson. Georgia is growing up in England with her best friend Jas and the rest of the Ace Gang, a group of best friends who share secrets, have sleepovers, and talk about boys whom they have snogged. She lives with her mother, father, her mad little sister Libby and her half Scottish Wildcat, Angus, whom the family found on a small family holiday to Scotland. Angus gets into trouble from Mr and Mrs Across the Road, the Prat Poodles, and his Kitty Girlfriend Naomi. Georgia falls for a boy named Robbie and her best friend Jas falls for Robbie's brother Tom, But Robbie starts to go out with a "wet weed", Lindsay, a year older than her. Eventually the two of them fall in love, and Georgia is hoping to start a relationship with Robbie, the sex god. The stories then continue on in the other books, following Robbie and Georgia's growing relationship until Robbie, Georgia's "first love" moves to Kiwi-a-go-go land (AKA New Zealand) to snogg Wombats. Soon Georgia falls for the "Italian Stallion" Masimo. As the series progresses, readers wait in anticipation to see who Georgia chooses in the end; Robbie, Masimo, or the one who really and truly loves her Dave (the Laugh). We follow through Georgia's mad adventures through 10 books.
