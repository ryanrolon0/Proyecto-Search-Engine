The story opens when Joe from a single parent family, a music lover and with a knack for curiosity - meets 16-year-old Candy on the streets of London. He soon learns that Candy is not only a runaway from her home town, but also a teenage prostitute and heroin addict. He immediately becomes infatuated with her. The pair begins dating cautiously, visiting London Zoo once, and Candy comes to see a gig that Joe and his band, The Katies, are playing. However, Candy's pimp, Iggy, feels that Joe Beck is a threat, worrying that Joe will reduce the business Candy takes in and thus reducing Iggy's income. When Joe finds Candy beaten, the pair attack Iggy and leave the city to hide and ease Candy off heroin. Iggy subsequently kidnaps Joe's older sister Gina, and uses her as a bargaining chip, claiming to plan to return her if Candy is returned to him. The novel climaxes when Iggy, Candy, Joe, his sister and his sister's boyfriend encounter one another at the family's remote country house. Candy stabs Iggy in the neck and the main story concludes. Candy is sent off to a rehab center for adolescents and Joe has a final meeting with her. Candy apologizes for everything and gets taken away. Joe is left wondering over her whereabouts and if he will ever see her again. The last chapter briefly explains that Joe's band received a record deal and had recorded Joe's song that he had written for Candy. They called several times for his permission to record it, but he never returned the calls. Although Joe was not at all upset by this, Candy very much was. This led to the last scene having Candy cry in Joe's arms, asking why their song was recorded. Did he have something to do with it? Left hanging on the streets all alone when Candy leaves, Joe is baffled, heartbroken, and still deeply in love.
