The story involves a girl named Clare who dances. Her best friend is Rosella. Her family's dream is for Clare to be in City Ballet, a program for very skilled dancers. There are only 16 positions in City Ballet. Things take a turn for the worse when her instructor tells her she's too tall, not only to be in City Ballet (although if she weren't as tall, she would have named it in), but to be in her own dance school! She is very upset at this. She is invited to dance with the adult class, where the adults dance, just to dance, but thinks the adult class is stupid. When her grandfather has a stroke, he loses the ability to talk and move his right side. When Clare finally steps up to take the adult class, everything changes.
