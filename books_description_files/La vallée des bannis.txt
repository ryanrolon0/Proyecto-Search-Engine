In La vallée des bannis, carried away by a furious torrent during their passage through Touboutt-Chan (from the previous story La frousse aux trousses), Spirou and Fantasio regain consciousness in the hostile environment of the "Valley of Banishment", their destination. Fantasio is soon infected by a mosquito carrying a virus, making him act extremely crazy. He runs off into the wild, and Spirou is forced to begin exploration of the area with only Spip as a companion. Spirou discovers the tragic destiny of the first people exiled in the valley, and while searching for other survivors and a way leading out of the valley, seeks a way to secure Fantasio's return and cure his state of madness. <!--
