Actress Lucy Waring leaves London to join her married sister Phyllida Forli in Corfu where the Forli family own three houses—two of them modern. One is occupied by the Forlis, the other rented out to Godfrey Manning who is taking photographs for a coffee table style book. The third, the much older Castello, is rented to actor Julian Gale and his son Max who is a musician. Julian Gale has two godchildren, twins Spiro and Miranda, who work in the Forli's houses. The idyllic scene is shattered when Spiro is reported drowned after falling overboard while out at night sailing in Godfrey Manning's boat. One theme running through the book is the idea that Corfu is the setting for The Tempest. Another theme is that of a dolphin which will approach humans. The book was serialised in the British magazine Woman's Journal. Julian Gale and the play Tiger, Tiger (with a different author) are also mentioned in The Wind Off the Small Isles (1968) by the same author.
