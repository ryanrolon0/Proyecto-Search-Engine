Caprona is a city-state in the Italy of Chrestomanci's world (World Twelve A), which was never united as a nation-state. The city is said to be losing its "virtue," a process which Chrestomanci blames on the malevolent influence of a mysterious enemy enchanter, making it vulnerable. Florence, Siena, and Pisa aim to capitalize on this weakness by uniting against Caprona in an attempt to conquer it. Chrestomanci has advised each spell-house that Caprona could regain its virtue if the true words to the Angel of Caprona, both a hymn and a powerful spell, could be found. The search is not helped by the deadly (and rather Shakespearean) rivalry between the two spell-houses, each quick to blame the other for the city's misfortunes. The story is told through the eyes of the young Tonino Montana and his brother Paolo. They are both members of Casa Montana, one of two spell-houses in Caprona, the other being Casa Petrocchi. The two spell-houses are deadly rivals; the two families are both convinced that the decline of Caprona is all the fault of the other spell-house, and refuse to work together under any circumstances. Tonino is, unknown to himself or the rest of Casa Montana, a talented enchanter; however, he is unaware of his ability, and prefers to spend his time reading. Paolo is more outgoing and friendly, and does better at school. When representatives of both houses are called to the Duke of Caprona's palace, they both go. Whilst there, they meet members of the Petrocchi family for the first time, and they also encounter the Duchess, a powerful woman who appears to be the true ruler of Caprona.
