Fifteen-year-old Manhattanite Elizabeth (who goes by the name of Daisy) is sent to stay with cousins on a remote farm in the English countryside during the outbreak of a fictional third world war (WWIII) of the 21st century. Though enthusiastic about moving away from an evil stepmother who is with her child, Daisy is homesick at first. This only lasts for a short while before she and her extended family become close, and Daisy begins to embrace her new home. Daisy soon finds herself falling in love with cousin Edmond and, after realizing that the affection is mutual, begins a relationship with him. Meanwhile, the family receives news that Daisy's aunt Penn is stranded in Oslo. During this period of time, terrorists attack from an unknown enemy who later occupies England. The war becomes increasingly difficult for Daisy and her family as it affects their lives to a greater extent, eventually leading to food shortages and lack of other resources. One day, the farm is taken over by soldiers who separate the boys from the girls by sending them away to live at separate homes, and then separate farms. Daisy and Piper are forced to put survival as their top priority and cannot look for the male members of their family. After the war ends, Daisy must deal with putting the pieces of her life back together and overcoming the terrible experience of war as she reunites with the forever changed members of her family, including a physically and emotionally scarred Edmond. The Meg Rosoff written young adult novel How I Live Now has been made into a film by Director Kevin Macdonald featuring Irish actress Saoirse Ronan playing the role of Daisy, with George MacKay as Edmond, Tom Holland as Isaac and Harley Bird as Piper. How I Live Now is currently in post production and is set for a 2013 release.
