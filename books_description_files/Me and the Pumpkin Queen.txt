The plot centers around an eleven-year old girl named Mildred whose mother, a former "pumpkin queen", died in Mildred's sixth year of life. Inspired by an image of her mother "wearing her Pumpkin Queen crown," Mildred tries to grow giant pumpkins in order to win a contest at the Circleville Pumpkin Show.
