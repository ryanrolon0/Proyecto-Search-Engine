Obi-Wan Kenobi is back in the Jedi Order. But now everything is different: his master Qui-Gon Jinn is sure he will become a great Jedi Knight, but he is not sure that Obi-Wan should still be his Padawan. Now they must unite forces to investigate the recent attacks on the Jedi Temple, including a failed assassination attempt on Yoda. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon team up with Bant and the recently rescued Tahl. They soon learn that Xanatos is the mastermind behind the recent Temple attacks, and that he has converted Obi-Wan's former rival, Bruck Chun, to his cause. Furthermore, it is uncovered that Xanatos is planning more attacks, namely on the reactor core of the Jedi Temple. Bruck Chun also kidnaps Bant. In order to continue funding Offworld Corporation, Xanatos demands vast supplies of Vertex, an expensive crystal worth high monetary value, in exchange for the temple's freedom and the release of Bant. Qui-Gon locates Xanatos and duels with him, while Obi-Wan hunts down Bruck. Xanatos escapes, but not before setting the Temple on a course for destruction. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Bruck fight in the Room of a Thousand Fountains, where Bant is being held. During the duel, Bruck slips, and ignores Obi-Wan's offer of forgiveness by choosing to fall to his death. Bant is rescued, and Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon soon locate the source of Xanatos' time bomb: the Fire Crystals locked in the reactor core. Although the Temple is free, Xanatos is once again at large. Qui-Gon has only one lead: Xanatos could be on his home planet, Telos. Obi-Wan decides to join Qui-Gon on his quest, even though the two are not master and padawan anymore.
