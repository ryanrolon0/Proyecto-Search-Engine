The book tries to show that the Wolf from The Three Little Pigs does not necessarily have to be "Big" and "Bad." The wolf justifies his journeys to the little pigs' houses as needing to ask for some sugar to bake a cake for his dear Granny's birthday, his "huffing and puffing" as him having a cold and "sneeze[ing] a great sneeze", and his eating of the pigs as not letting good meat go to waste, since the pigs die in the sneeze anyway. At the very end of the book, it is revealed that the wolf has been telling the whole story from prison telling the reader that "he's been framed", having been caught during his 'attack' on the third pig's house due to his rage after the pig insulted his granny and rudely dismissed his polite requests for sugar.
