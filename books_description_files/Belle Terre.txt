The Enterprise is leading thirty-thousand colonists on a six month trip to establish a strategically important colony. Just after they make their first attempts at settling in, Spock discovers a nearby moon has two important features. It is made of a very valuable ore and is also unstable. If it blows, all the colonists will be killed.
