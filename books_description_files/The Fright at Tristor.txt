The plot of The Fright at Tristor begins with a mention of the brutal murders occurring in the hamlet of Tristor, in the northern reaches of the Theocracy of the Pale. The townsfolk fear that they may be the next target of these attacks. The party has been hired to investigate, a reward being offered if they can stop these murders occurring. Some believe the source of the attacks to be a band of orcs following a mysterious entity known as "The Watcher." When outlying farms are attacked outright, it is up to the adventurers to halt these killings and save the town.
