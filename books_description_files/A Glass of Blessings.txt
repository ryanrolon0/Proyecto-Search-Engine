The central character and narrator, Wilmet Forsyth, is a married woman with a comfortable though routine life. She does not need to work and enjoys a life of leisure. When not lunching or shopping she occupies her time, somewhat guiltily, with occasional "good works", particularly at the instigation of her slightly eccentric do-gooder mother-in-law. She becomes drawn into the social life of her church, St. Luke's. After a church service one day she renews her acquaintance with a close friend's attractive but ne'er-do-well brother, Piers Longridge. She develops a romantic interest in Piers, and begins to believe that he is her secret admirer. The admirer is in fact her close friend's husband. Wilmet fails to realise that Piers is gay until she becomes aware of his relationship with Keith, a lower-class young man. The subject of homosexuality is not infrequent in Pym's work, but it is usually referred to in oblique and subtle ways. This novel is surprisingly frank about the subject, especially for a comedy of manners published in 1958. The reader can reach no conclusion other than that Piers and Keith live together in a romantic relationship.
