The story begins with Olwen and Guardian, who live alone on the planet of Isis, manning the Isis Light, the means with which they communicate with Earth. It is Olwen's 16th birthday (10th on Isis), and Guardian tells her that settlers are coming from Earth. Olwen is in distress thinking that these settlers will ruin her perfect world. Guardian explains that she must wear a special protective suit to protect her from the viruses and bacteria the settlers might be carrying. One of the younger settlers, Mark London, falls in love with Olwen, and Olwen wishes Guardian to allow her to see Mark without her suit. Guardian refuses. One day, Mark overhears Guardian discussing some of Olwen's blood samples with Dr. Macdonald and he thinks Olwen might be in trouble so he climbs up towards her house. He suffers an accident and falls from the top of Lighthouse Mesa because of Olwen's appearance. Later, Guardian tells Olwen the truth about the death of her parents, and that her mother gave care of Olwen to him. To keep Olwen safe, he changed her genetically, so the ultraviolet rays from Isis' sun, Ra, would not harm her, so she could climb to the heights, as Isis is a planet of mountains. When the settlers see Olwen as her true self, they are disgusted, and Olwen refuses to wear the suit or see any of the settlers again. Then there is a solar storm and Olwen goes out and rescues a young boy, Jody, who was outside in it. The settlers do not know how to react. The story ends with Olwen deciding to leave the settlers' valley, Cascade Valley, and live in isolation with Guardian and her "dog" which is really a dragon, Little Hobbit. We also find out that Guardian is actually a robot called DaCoP (Data Collector and Processor).
