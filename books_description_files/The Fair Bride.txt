A priest finds himself on the run from the Spanish Republicans, who accuse priests of indoctrinating their followers against them. The priest slips into a cabaret to hide and meets a young girl, an entertainer in the club. His commitment to the priesthood is wavering due to the persecution he suffers and he begins to fall for her. Both of them wind up being arrested. Meanwhile, both sides are searching for a sacred relic that is believed to have miraculous powers - it is said to have helped defeat Napoleon. Each side wants it for its own reasons. The relic ends up in the priest’s possession.
