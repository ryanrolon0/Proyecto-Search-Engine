The book is a transcript of a sermon given to the Connecticut General Assembly, on May 8, 1783. At the time, Stiles was the President of Yale College. The sermon draws parallels between the United States and the Biblical nation of Israel. Stiles refers to the US as an "American Israel, high above all nations which He hath made, in numbers, and in praise, and in name, and in honor", suggesting that the American people are like the Chosen People of Israel.
