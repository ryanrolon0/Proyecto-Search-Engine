The work includes twenty-seven photographs, taken by the author in the course of research for the book. Lamont describes the difficulty authors often encounter in writing and publishing critical books on the Church of Scientology: "Books about Scientology have a greater permanency than newspaper articles and therefore it should not come as a surprise that vigorous smear-campaigns have been conducted against the authors of such investigations." Lamont later goes on to chronicle some of the harassment suffered by author Paulette Cooper after the publication of The Scandal of Scientology, including recounting parts of Operation Freakout. Lamont also goes into the inherent motivation for profit within the organization. The book also details L. Ron Hubbard's actions later in life: his retreat to sea, isolated lifestyle in California, and death.
