Ellery Queen investigates a murder that took place a number of years ago and has blighted the present-day lives of members of the Fox family. "For the twelve years following the death of Davy's mother Jessica, and the trial of his father, Davy Fox has suffered inner torture. Davy knew he loved his wife ... as well as he knew he was going to kill her. He didn't know just when it was going to happen -- but when a man is born to be a murderer, it's only a matter of time before he claims his birthright. Love turns out to be a matter of life and death -- and it's up to Ellery Queen to make the choice!"
