In The Belt of Great Cold, Fantasio made the eccentric purchase of an old ship on which he, Spirou and Spip go on a journey by sea. They end up arriving in a zone in which the climate resembles the North Pole, but the three scientists living the close island explains to them that this “belt of cold” is caused artificially and that the island is fictitious also. Thus, these scientists build an interplanetary vessel in order to flee the Earth, whose great powers try to exploit their genius with fine soldiers. Mercenaries occur, with the orders of the commander Alexander, in order to take them along, but Spirou and Fantasio manage to slow down them sufficiently a long time and the scientists flee in their making believe that they all are died. <!--
