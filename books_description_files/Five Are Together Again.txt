The children are supposed to be staying at Kirrin Cottage but as soon as George's mother and father's maid Joanna catches scarlet fever, the Five are sent to live with an old friend, called Tinker, and his famous scientist father. When Tinker's (who appeared in 'Five Go To Demon's Rocks' (1961)) father's top secret papers go missing, it is left up to the children to find the thief, whoever he is. There are some circus folk camping in Tinker's field.
