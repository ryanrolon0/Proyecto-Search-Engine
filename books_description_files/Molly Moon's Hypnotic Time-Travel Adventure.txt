Molly is trying to fit in her new life as the daughter of a billionaire (Primo Cell), but things aren't going so well. This is mainly because her mother is depressed about losing her 11 years of her life to hypnotism. She walks around the property miserable and all she does is sulk. Molly tries to help her but is soon subjected to the mystery of her missing pug. While looking she is hypnotised and taken to another time. She is taken to India in 1870, and taken to a fine red fort. Her escort, Zackya, is getting more and more nervous as they approach the main room. Then she has the displeasure of meeting the Maharaja of Waqt, a fat scally man, who wishes to kill her to stop her from wrecking the plans made in the last two books, since the Maharaja is the mastermind who hypnotized Cornelius Logan in the first place to hypnotize Lucy and Primo Cell. Taken back into the 1870s, Molly makes a new friend named Ojas who helps her, Rocky, and Forest defeat the mad Maharaja and save time as we know it. The Maharaja kidnaps a baby Molly, three-year old Molly, six-year old Molly, and 10-year old Molly by time traveling. It reveals her Uncle Cornelius was actually hypnotized as a young boy by the Maharaja and that Molly has a twin brother. es:Molly Moon viaja a través del tiempo sv:Molly Moons hypnotiska tidsresa
