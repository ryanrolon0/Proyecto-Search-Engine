One of Harding's Pleasure & Profit Books. Deadfalls and Snares, first published in 1907, is an instructional book for trappers on the art of building deadfalls from logs, boards and rocks, and making snares and toss poles, for catching all types of furbearers, such as skunk, opossum, raccoon, mink, marten and bear, and coop traps for catching wild turkey and quail. The author states that thousands of trappers around the world use deadfalls, snares and other homemade traps, but among American trappers there are many thousand who know little or nothing about them. The book contains 50 line drawings of differently constructed deadfalls made of logs, boards or stones, coop or pen style traps, trigger designs, and snare sets. There are also chapters on skinning, stretching, handling and grading fur pelts, plus a listing of Newhouse steel traps, available in the early 1900s. The building, baiting and setting instructions are written by various American and Canadian trappers who are named only by their country or state of residence.
