Tanis, the Shadow Years is set in the five years before Dragons of Autumn Twilight where the Heroes of the Lance split up and look for signs of gods returning and a new evil stirring in the world. Tanis leaves Solace with Clotnik after the promise that the dwarven juggler can lead him to his long-lost human father. On the way they are trapped in a grass fire but manage to save themselves and a mage, Kispha. Kispha is injured and dying and offers to help Tanis find his father in the mage's own memory as long as he saves Brandella and bring her back.
