Dr Cooper meets with a man at the Langley Memorial Art Museum in New York. He wishes to hire Dr Cooper to retrieve valuable artwork from Central America that were recovered from the tomb of Toco-Rey, an Olteca king who died nearly 1200 years ago. Dr Ben Cory was sent to find the city, following a map left by Jose de Carlon, who rediscovered the city in 1536, but whose men succumbed to madness shortly thereafter. Cory is also missing.
