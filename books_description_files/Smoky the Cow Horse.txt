The story details the life of a horse in the western United States from his birth to his eventual decline. It takes place after the 1910s, during which the West dies away and there are cars. Smoky is born in the wild, but is captured and trained by a cowboy named Clint. Clint is taken by Smoky's intelligence and spirit, and uses him as his personal steed. Under his guidance, Smoky soon becomes known as the best cowhorse around. Unfortunately, Smoky is among a number of horses stolen by a horse thief. When Smoky refuses to allow the thief to ride him, being loyal only to Clint, he is beaten repeatidly in punishment. Developing an intense hatred for humans from this treatment, Smoky eventually attacks and kills the thief. When Smoky is eventually captured by local authorities, his now violent and aggressive demeanor prompts his use as a bucking bronco at a rodeo. Under the moniker of "The Cougar", Smoky becomes the most famous rodeo attraction in the South West, and people come from miles away to attempt to ride him. Years of performing at the rodeo eventually take their toll on his body and spirit, and he is left a shell of his former self. As he is no longer of any use as a rodeo horse, he is renamed "Cloudy" and used as a riding horse, and then later sold to an abusive man who starves him. It is during this time that Clint is finally reunited with Smoky. While in town on business, Clint spots and recognizes the horse. After having Smoky's current owner arrested for his acts of cruelty, Clint reclaims him and takes him home with him. Although Clint initially despairs at the condition Smoky is now in, his careful treatment of the horse eventually begins to show results. In the end, Smoky has completely recovered his former health and personality. An illustrated edition was issued in 1929.
