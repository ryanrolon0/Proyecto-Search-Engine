The principal characters are Maxim Kammerer and Toyvo Glumov, both working for an organization which investigates "Unexplained Events" ("UE"s). Their investigation of a series of events leads them to believe that they are witnesses to a new action by the Wanderers. After much investigation, the UEs are discovered to be the work of a secret society called the Ludens. The Ludens are born human, but possess latent mental powers far beyond those of normal humans. They view themselves as a distinct race, and claim to have "different interests" from humanity at large, in some instances claiming to be above traditional human morality. The Ludens routinely conduct experiments on humans and alter their minds in order to further their own means. Kammerer and Glumov's investigation unmasks the Ludens, and they are made public in what would later be called "The Great Revelation." At the end of the novel, the Ludens discover that Glumov himself has the capacity to become a Luden, and Glumov must decide whether or not to join their race. Glumov at first states that to join the Ludens would be a betrayal of his family, friends, and civilization. The book ends on a sinister note, with Glumov becoming a member of the Luden group, the implication being that he was coerced. Indeed, the story is told as Maxim's memoir, his sole intent in writing it being to clear up the story of Glumov: another source (in the fictional setting) had implied that Glumov was in the Luden group all along.
