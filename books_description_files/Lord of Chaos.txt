The deposed Queen of Andor, Morgase Trakand, goes to Amadicia to seek aid in returning to the throne. However, she is as good as taken captive by the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, Pedron Niall. In response to the declaration of amnesty for men who can channel by Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, Mazrim Taim, a previous False Dragon who had wrought destruction in the Borderlands, swears allegiance to him. Rand has Mazrim Taim lead and train the newly-established Asha'man at the so-called Black Tower. Rand is diplomatically courted by both the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar, who send an envoy to Caemlyn, and the Aes Sedai of the White Tower, who send an envoy to Cairhien. In Emond's Field, Perrin Aybara, making his return to the series after his absence in the previous book, feels the pull of ta'veren upon ta'veren and heads to Caemlyn to join Rand. Wrongly thinking the Salidar Aes Sedai few in number and cowed, Rand sends Mat Cauthon to retrieve Elayne Trakand and win the allegiance of the rebel Aes Sedai. Mat discovers that Egwene al'Vere has been named the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, and when she sends Nynaeve al'Meara and Elayne to Ebou Dar in Altara to search for a ter'angreal with which to break the Dark One's control of the climate, Mat goes with them. Shortly after Perrin joins up with him, Rand is secretly kidnapped by Elaida's Aes Sedai, who begin journeying back to Tar Valon. Along the way Rand is tortured severely and constantly, which has long-lasting effects on his psyche. Learning of the kidnapping, Perrin leads a mixed force of Rand's followers after the Aes Sedai, leading to the climactic Battle of Dumai's Wells. At the end of the battle, the rebel Aes Sedai are forced to swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn while the surviving White Tower Aes Sedai, who kidnapped Rand, remain captives.
