Isaura, daughter of a Portuguese worker and a freed black woman, is an enslaved girl that endured hard times before she was freed and finally married her star-crossed lover, Álvaro. Meanwhile she suffered greatly at the hands of Leôncio Almeida, the landlord of a plantation and main antagonist in the plot, who wanted to make her a concubine. She even became briefly engaged to the humpback dwarf Melchior and almost married him to avoid prostitution, before Álvaro came in her aid.
