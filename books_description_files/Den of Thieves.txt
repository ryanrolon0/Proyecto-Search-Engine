Because of this, many of the servants and actors have to leave and find work elsewhere, including Cat. Her friend Pedro is going with the Signor, and Cat is too proud to ask anyone for help. Due to this she is left in the streets and falls prey to a book selling fraud. Later she is rescued by Frank and Mr Sheridan. Mr Sheridan decides to send her to Paris to work as a spy, as he thinks she's perfect for the job. So Cat travels to Paris under the pretence of a girl learning ballet, and hates it. She and Frank are soon tangled up in a revolt. They manage to escape, but the thieves have taken their money and clothes.
