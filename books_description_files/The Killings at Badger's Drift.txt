In the fictional village of "Badger's Drift", the elderly Miss Bellringer insists that her friend, Emily Simpson, did not die of a heart attack as her doctor claims, but was in fact murdered. An autopsy soon proves her right, as a mix of red wine and hemlock is found in the dead woman's system. While the village descends into panic, the murderer strikes again, claiming the life of Mrs. Rainbird, before leaving her corpse to be discovered by her son Dennis, a local undertaker. As Barnaby investigates, aided by Sgt. Gavin Troy, he uncovers a connection between an older crime and the current killings at Badger's Drift.
