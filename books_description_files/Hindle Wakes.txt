The play is set in the fictional mill town of Hindle in Lancashire in England, and concerns two young people who are discovered to have been having what would now be called a "dirty weekend" during their holiday, during the town's wakes week. Their families pressure them to get married, but the young woman refuses. She is disowned by her people but manages to get her job at the mill back. It seemed quite a controversial and subversive piece at the time it was written.
