The story tells a child's experience in the Blitz during World War II and his rescue from an air-raid shelter. Suffering from a wartime childhood and post-war shortages in London, Timothy has little to enrich his early youth. Everything changes when his glamorous older sister Kath invites him to spend the summer in Heidelberg, Germany. Kath, who left home long ago to work for the American Army, introduces her sixteen-year-old brother to a lifestyle that is deliriously fast, furious and extravagant. Dazzled by the ingulgent habits of the American forces, but at the same time sensitive to the broken spirit of the German community beneath this sparkling surface, Timothy will find that his summer holiday is in more ways than one an unforgettable rite of passage.
