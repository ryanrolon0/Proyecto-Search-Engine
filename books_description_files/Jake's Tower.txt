Every day life for Jake is a struggle due to his mother's horrible and violent boyfriend, Steve. To escape his problems, Jake dreams of having his own tall tower where he can be peaceful and safe. In his pretend tower he daydreams of his father, who gave him a hug and a fluffy duck when he was born. Though certain he will never see him again, Jake believes that he might somehow get to meet him one day. But when the struggle gets too much for him and his mother, they run away from Steve to Jake's grandmother (his father's mother, Mrs Judd). She never believed that Jake was her son's son until she meets him and, seeing the resemblance, she helps protect him from the danger that he is involved in. However, Jake's mother insists on fighting for Jake's custody, resulting in a case conference between Jake's mother and his grandmother. Meanwhile, Jake bestfriend Kieran, a boy at his school and they agree to go to and from school with each other. When Kieran is sick one day, Jake takes a shortcut, only to be apprehended by the one person he did not want to meet - Steve. Steve grabs Jake, but immediately releases him when Jake's teachers come out. However, when his teacher leave, Steve starts to intimidate Jake again. Jake manages to escape to his grandmother's house, where Mrs. Judd manages to get rid of Steve when he follows Jake. The following day Jake returns home from school while Mrs Judd and his mother are at his case conference. Suddenly the door opens - standing at the living room door is Jake's father.
