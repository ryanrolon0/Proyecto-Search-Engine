In the autobiography, the British aristocrat recounts her colourful past. Such as her marriage to Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, her association with Nazi figures and her subsequent three year internment under Defence Regulation 18B. She also recounts her frienships with leading literary figures sich as Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, John Betjeman and Lytton Strachey. In the 2002 edition, she describes several events which occurred following the original 1977 publication. Such as the grief she experienced after her husband's death, her brain tumour as well as her reaction to international events and public figures. She also writes about her "secret" missions to Germany before war broke out, when she helped set up a radio station to raise funds for the BUF.
