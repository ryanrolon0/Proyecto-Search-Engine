Ghost in the Machine picks up where Skeleton Creek left off, with Ryan and Sarah trapped in the Dredge. They escape and return home, after finding out about the Crossbones, a secret society that protects the Dredge. Ryan learns that his father, Paul McCray, is one of the last ones alive. When Sarah and Ryan return home they attempt to find out as much as they can about the Crossbones. This includes, spying on Ryan's dad, interviews with Henry, Paul's best friend, and encounters with Old Joe Bush, the horrifying ghost of the Dredge. In the end, Ryan and Sarah discover that the Dredge is filled with millions of dollars worth of gold and that Henry is really insane and has been disguising himself as Old Joe Bush.
