The Forge of Fury is a dungeon crawl, a site-based adventure describing the stronghold of Khundrukar. The great dwarven smith Durgeddin the Black founded the secret stronghold within a great underground cavern system two hundred years ago when he and his clan were driven from his home by a horde of orcs and trolls. The orcs discovered the location of Khundrukar a century ago when they captured one of Durgeddin's clansmen, and raised a great army that stormed the stronghold and slew the dwarves, allowing its five levels to fall into ruins as goblins, orcs, and other monsters used the place as a base. Legends tell of the extraordinary blades Durgeddin forged in anger, enticing the player characters to come to the ruins of Khundrukar in search of these weapons.
