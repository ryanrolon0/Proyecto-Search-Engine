In a number of episodes Conan, now in his mid- to late-twenties, is followed from the end of his career as a mercenary soldier for King Yildiz of Turan to his initial adventures in the black kingdoms of Kush. In between he visits his native Cimmeria and the far north then makes his way southward where, in Argos, he gets his first taste of life as a sea rover as the right hand man of the pirate queen Bêlit. Chronologically, the eight short stories collected as Conan of Cimmeria fall between Conan and Conan the Freebooter.
