Translated from the blurb issued by Dargaud to publicise the new album: :"Embarked on board a vessel under the command of Singh'a Rough'a, Valérian and Laureline at last enter the Great Void, the unknown space where the end of the universe is in formation. There, always in search of the disappeared Earth, they will confront the Wolochs, terrifying stone monsters that reign there as impassive masters."
