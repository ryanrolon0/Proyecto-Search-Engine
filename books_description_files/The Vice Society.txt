Ex-detective George Williamson receives a letter advising him that the death of his wife seven years previously was not suicide (as the inquest had suggested). Rather, it was murder and the solution to that crime is allegedly the same as another crime currently being investigated by Williamson’s rival (and ex-boss) Inspector Albert Newsome. As the two investigators race to solve the strange case of a man who fell out of a window in Holywell Street, it becomes clear that the criminals behind both deaths are more powerful and dangerous than anyone could have expected. The key to all investigations proves to be a single name; “Persephone”.
