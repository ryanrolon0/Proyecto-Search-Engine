Upon giving birth to a son, John, a tiny doubt in Luz's mind takes root and soon grows into an obsession, and thus begins Luz's quest for her past: was she indeed, as she had always believed, the daughter and grand-daughter of a family loyal to the dictatorship in Argentina, or was she in fact one of the country's missing children, one of the desaparecidos whose whereabouts were in many cases never discovered. Luz (whose name means "light" in Spanish) seeks her true identity with great courage, bringing to light the darkest corners of the society in which she has been raised, and of which, until now, considered herself a participant. Her search will lead to the discovery of a country divided by a brutal, criminal regime, which caused its own citizens to vanish, hiding them and, worst of all, forgetting them. Luz, on her road to the truth, shines a light in the shadows covering the horrors in this poignant novel that recounts beautifully, from an opposing viewpoint, a tale from Argentina's recent past: the story of the grandchildren of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo).
