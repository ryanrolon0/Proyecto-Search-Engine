On New Year’s Eve, a wild storm hits northern California. In San Francisco, amongst the chaos and damage, three people's worlds collide. Quinn Thompson will allow his barriers to fall, built so carefully following his wife’s death. Maggie Dartman finds friendship amongst the wreckage and for Jack Adams, a carpenter who repairs their homes, the chance to unburden his secrets. In the aftermath, Quinn builds a 180-foot yacht which he plans to sail around the world and escape the pain. But with his new friends beside him and the outlook on life brightening, Quinn begins to feel hope once more and that miracles really do happen in all different kinds of ways.
