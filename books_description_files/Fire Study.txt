Yelena and friends set off to capture Cahil and Ferde, the soul stealer, only to find that they are not the biggest threat to Sitia anymore. A clan of magicians using Blood magic is trying to take over the Citadel and they will kill anybody that stands in their way. But with the possibility of someone close to her being a traitor and the added stress of finding out what it means to be a Soul finder, Yelena may not be able to stop the Fire Warper from taking control of Sitia. Especially when her loyalty is tested and she may have to pick a side with the possibility of a war between Sitia and Ixia on the horizon.
