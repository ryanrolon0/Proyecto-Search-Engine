Lauren Conrad's second L.A. Candy book opens with the red carpet premiere of season two of the red-hot reality show starring Jane Roberts. But everything isn't as hunky dory as Jane's smiles make it look for the photographers. After Madison's nasty betrayal of her last season, Jane has decided that sticking by her true friends is key. Not dating is equally as important, because boys lead to trouble with a capital T. Of course, when a couple of boys who Jane has history with show up, she conveniently forgets all about her big plans. At the same time, her best friend Scarlett is having boy troubles of her own, namely with her very jealous boyfriend, Liam.
