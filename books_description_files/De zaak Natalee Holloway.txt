In the introduction to the book, Van der Sloot states, "I see this book as my opportunity to be open and honest about everything that happened, for anyone who wants to read it." The book presents Van der Sloot's account of the night Holloway disappeared and the media frenzy which followed. Details of his encounter with Holloway at the Carlos'n Charlie's nightclub in Oranjestad, Aruba is covered in explicit detail. He admits to lying in the past and apologizes for his actions, stating that he "found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time, and took a wrong decision." However, he insists that he did not break the law and is not a murderer.
