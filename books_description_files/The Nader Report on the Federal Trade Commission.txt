It is important to note that this report is based on the FTC as it was in the 1960s. During this time, the FTC was under scrutiny for major weaknesses. One year after the Nader Report was published, the ABA Commission to Study the FTC also issued a report criticizing the FTC, exploring whether or not the FTC should be abolished. The main arguments of the Nader Report were: * The FTC is ineffective. * The FTC is passive about its duties, is not proactive about discovering violations, delays actions to an unreasonable extent, and has ineffective enforcement practices. * The FTC should prioritize problems that have a high area of impact (e.g., many potential victims, particularly vulnerable victims, extraordinary cost to the victims). * The FTC needs to improve detection of such problems, particularly through direct grassroots involvement and active investigation. * The FTC needs to resolve the fundamental process and power issues that prevent it from taking action in a timely manner. * The FTC should not be a "friend" to business; it needs to be feared, and it needs to provide strong disincentives to businesses for committing violations. * The FTC should not be able to hide behind secrecy and powerful political and business relationships.
