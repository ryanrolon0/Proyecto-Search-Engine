The novel is set in Portugal in the summer of 1938, during Salazar's dictatorship. Pereira, an old journalist of a Portoguese newspaper - the Lisboa - who loves literature and pratically spends all his life for it, reads an essay written by a young man about death. He calls the young man, whose name is Monteiro Rossi, to ask him to write "advanced obituaries" about great writers who could die at any moment. Not having ever been much concerned with politics, Pereira's world is turned upside down when he begins to get to know the distracted and leftist youth. The articles he receives from Monteiro Rossi (and pays him for) have a definite leftist slant and are completely unpublishable, but something continues to attract Pereira to him, perhaps the fact that his wife died before he could have children of his own. His visit to a clinic to help his ailing heart puts him in contact with a doctor, with whom he becomes close friends and discusses the doubts he is beginning to have about his isolated and apolitical life. In the end fascist police visit Pereira and beat to death Monteiro Rossi. With the help of a phone call from his doctor friend, Pereira manages to slip an article about the murder and condemning the regime into the newspaper he works for.
