The story opens with the Diamond Brothers being hired by the American crime author Joe Carter, who finances Lenny Smile's children's charity Dream Time. Lenny Smile apparently died in a tragic accident when he was run over by a steamroller just before Carter was due to meet him for the first time. The American wants them to find out what really happened to the reclusive philanthropist he so much admired. He shows them his only photograph of Lenny, in which the man's features are blurred. Tim and Nick interview Lenny's two assistants at the charity offices and his neighbour, and visit his grave. At the cemetery, Nick spots someone who looks like the Lenny Smile in the photograph, and wonders if he could still be alive. They visit the Steamroller driver who is in a mental hospital, but due to Tim's words, like 'The clues are a bit thin on the ground,' the man loses more of his sanity. The brothers discover that a balloon seller advertising the Russian circus may have witnessed the accident, but when they go to the circus to speak to him, Nick again sees someone who looks like Lenny Smile, and they find the balloon seller has just been stabbed to death. Tim foolishly picks up the knife and the circus performers assume he is the murderer, partly due to Tim trying to correct a clown's grammar. A bizarre chase across the fields ensues, before a Police Car driven by Snape saves the Brothers. After hearing that the charity is under investigation for fraud, Nick finds out about the missing investigator and decides to visit the grave of Lenny Smiles again. It is there he realizes that the corpse is not of the Lenny but the investigator. In a thrilling finale at the London Eye, Nick deduces that 'Lenny Smile' is simply an assumed name that could be used by Lenny's 'assistants' as cover for their own crimes. They then reveal the compartment was bugged, and the Police are in compartments on either side.
