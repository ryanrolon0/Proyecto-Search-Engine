In this novel humanity is under assault by an overwhelming technologically superior alien race called "Waisters" who are threatening to exterminate the human race. Unlike his later books which focus on humanity's technological evolution and how it affects the definition of humanity, Aggressor Six is a piece of military science fiction. However this novel is set apart from other military science fiction novels in that it maintains Wil McCarthy's adherence to technical scientific realism, particularly during the combat scenes. One major point of the story is that the aliens are technologically far more advanced than the humans, meaning the standard naval models of combat used in many science fiction works would be impractical, requiring a re-examination of how space combat will occur. It also examines the idea that aliens, if encountered, will be truly 'alien'- driven by desires and motives which will not be immediately obvious to humans.
