Claire Weiss was killed in 1995. Although she doesn't remember too much of what happened, she does recall that she was murdered by two thugs while she laid with her soon-to-be husband Matt in bed. After her death, she was stuck in purgatory. While in purgatory, she discovered that every nine years after a person dies, they can returned to earth around Halloween and live as a mortal. Then, if the Spirit American (that is what ghosts preferred to be called) can help someone on Earth, can can have another nine days as a mortal before they were sent back to purgatory. So she waited nine years to come back to earth in order to discover why she was murdered. Before she returned, she was given a case worker named Bonnie and an emergency phone number in case she needed to contact her. The night she returned to Earth, she reconnected with Jake Faron. The two then work together to discover the truth about Claire's death as well as enjoy the heavenly pleasures Earth has to offer. then had sex with him and came hugely!
