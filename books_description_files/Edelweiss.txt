Kazushi, Appo, Pierre and Daigo are four average high school students. They are bored of their life and want to find a girl that can be their girlfriend, but no girls accept them. One day they hear about a exchange program to an all-girls school on a deserted island and they have no doubts on going there. Once they arrive, they discover the school's secret: it teaches the secrets of alchemy and how to handle them. Later, they meet the girls and have to help them, as each one has a problem that can't be solved by them.
