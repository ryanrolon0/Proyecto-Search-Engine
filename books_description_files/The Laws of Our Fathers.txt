When last seen in Turow's The Burden of Proof, Sonia Klonsky was a prosecutor in Kindle County Courthouse with a failing marriage, an infant daughter, and a single mastectomy. She becomes the narrator here. Now she is a Superior Court Judge presiding over the murder trial of one Nile Eddgar, who is accused of arranging the murder of his ghetto-activist mother. The story is told in two parallel narratives, one regarding the current trial and the other taking the reader through the 1960s. Many of the minor characters in The Laws of Our Fathers also appear in Turow's other novels, which are all set in fictional, Midwestern Kindle County. es:The Laws of Our Fathers (novela)
