Amityville, New York. Once the Dutch Colonial house on Ocean Avenue had been the scene of a gruesome possession that sent its owners fleeing for their sanity and their lives. For years, it had remained abandoned, without any sign of disturbance. Then 11-year-old Kooch Webster dared his buddy Lester to sneak into the house. They only wanted to steal some junk to make a little pocket money. But something terrible still lurked within the crumbling walls—a monstrous evil that threatened to destroy not only the boys, but anyone who came in contact with them. Insidiously, the evil within the house spread into the community; a pawnbroker who bought the boys' stolen goods was found brutally slain, a priest disappeared mysteriously after visiting the house, and soon Kooch, Lester and their families were caught in an unrelenting web of terror for which there was no rational explanation, and no possible escape.
