In the story, a 12-year-old boy from New York named Daniel Chang wakes one night to what he thinks is a clap of thunder, only to discover some days later he is possessed of superhuman abilities of nearly god-like proportions. He and his best friend, Paulie, are then sought out by a survived branch of The Knights Templar and befriended by another host of The Power, an old man known only as Voice. Power is an 80-chapter paperback and also exists as a full-length screenplay.
