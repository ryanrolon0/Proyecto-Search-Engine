A girl named Camilla Cream loves lima beans but doesn't want to eat them because she wants to fit in. One day she wakes up to discover stripes on her body. Her parents then call the doctor, who then issues his verdict: she can still go to school. Unfortunately, once there, the other kids taunt her by calling out colors so that her color changes. She is then sent home because the faculty is worried the stripes are contagious. The doctor also bring in other doctors to examine the case. He gives her bitter pills to take before bed. However, after taking a pill, she wakes up to find herself transformed into a pill. The doctor calls in experts, and by this time, Camilla is recognized by the media as the "amazing transforming kid". While the experts talk to each other, thinking if it's a virus, bacteria or fungus, the infections grow on Camilla, and this continues until Camilla's face is not recognizable and grows roots, berries, crystals, feathers, and a long furry cat tail. When a spiritual counselor confronts Camilla, telling her to "become one with her room" she does exactly that, and melts onto the walls of her bedroom, taking control of the bed, the dresser and two picture frames as her face. Then, an old woman visits her and offers her lima beans. At first she rejects, still feeling self conscious, but before the woman leaves she has second thoughts. The lady then throws the beans inside her mouth. The walls then swirl and Camilla forms into a girl again.
