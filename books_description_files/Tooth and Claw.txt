The book's plot is similar to that of a Victorian romance, with the obvious difference that the protagonists are not human beings but dragons. It has been compared to Anthony Trollope's novel Framley Parsonage. The novel begins with the death of the patriarch of a family of dragons. The novel follows the lives of his children, along with other characters.
