Together again in the summer holidays, the Five Find Outers are finding the hot summer rather dull - until they learn that Peterswood is apparently the headquarters of a gang of poachers who are carrying out burglaries outside of the village. It appears that the gang may be passing messages to each other in Peterswood. Fatty's voice has broken, and this allows him to use a wide range of new adult disguises. Fatty tries out various new disguises including that of an old balloon selling woman, and finally disguising himself as an old tramp who spends his afternoons sitting on a bench in the middle of the village. The children discover that the old man was being used by the gang to pass on messages. The children learn that the gang plan to meet at a waxworks hall, to discuss their next robbery. Fatty disguises himself as Napoleon so that he can listen in on the gang's meeting. Mr Goon, however, has the same idea and disguises himself as a policeman. Unfortunately, during the gang meeting, Mr.Goon sneezes, giving the game away - but Fatty is caught instead. The gang tie Fatty up and lock him in a cupboard before leaving to carry out their latest jewellery robbery. Mr. Goon leaves Fatty locked in the cupboard to teach him a lesson, but luckily Larry returns to the Town hall and frees him. The children believe that Mr Goon has solved the mystery before them, as the jewel thieves are arrested. However, a pearl necklace they stole is missing. The grand mystery has a grand ending, then.
