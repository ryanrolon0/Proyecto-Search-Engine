Twelve-year-old Rose Larkin is an orphan whose parents have died when she was only three years old. Rose originally lived with her grandmother. After her grandmother dies, she is sent off to live with relatives in Ontario, Canada. After being miserable about the way her cousins treat her, she flees down into a root cellar. There, Rose is transported back in in time to the 1860's and the American Civil War.
