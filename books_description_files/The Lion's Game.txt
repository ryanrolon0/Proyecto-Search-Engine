The book opens with Corey, his new FBI boss Kate Mayfield, CIA agent Ted Nash and FBI agent George Foster (both introduced in the previous Corey novel, Plum Island), awaiting the arrival of a defecting Libyan terrorist, Asad Khalil, at John F. Kennedy Airport. However, even before the Boeing 747 from Paris has landed, it becomes apparent that something is unusual about the flight.
