Carrie Pilby's eponymous main character is a 19-year-old genius who graduated from Harvard College early and has no idea how to fit in, date, or talk to other people after college. She believes the majority of people in her hometown, New York City, to be sex-obsessed, immoral, and hypocrites. She felt the same way about students who did dangerous things in college, like drinking to excess and having sex, and as a result felt very isolated, although she confesses that she reluctantly lost her virginity to a professor there. Her therapist in New York gives her a five-point plan to test her very black-and-white beliefs, including going on dates and attending parties. She meets a cast of characters who challenge her beliefs, and she even becomes attracted to a man who espouses views she despises. Ultimately, the main character faces the universal coming-of-age decisions about which tradeoffs, if any, are acceptable to make in order to fit into society.
