0 wants to go in the Apple Tree but lots of numbers come before her. After all the numbers except 0 are up the Apple Tree, bumble bees come and say that its their tree. The bees fly around them causing every number (Except 10 who is hiding) to fall down. 0 now knows where she should be in the Apple Tree and 0 joins with 10 to make the number 100 and all of the numbers come back out and cheer for 10 & 0.
