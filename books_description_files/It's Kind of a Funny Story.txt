Craig, the protagonist and narrator, is a 15 year old teenager who lives with his family in an upper-middle class Manhattan neighborhood in New York City. He attends the prestigious Executive Pre-Professional High School, having studied arduously to win admission. Once admitted, however, he becomes overwhelmed by the school's intense academic pressure, as well as his unrequited love for Nia, his best friend Aaron's girlfriend. His stress eventually manifests itself in an eating disorder, depression, use of marijuana, affected sleep habits, and suicidal thoughts. After he stops taking medication prescribed by his psychiatrist, his depression builds up until, unable to fend off his suicidal ideation, he calls 1-800-SUICIDE and is admitted to a nearby psychiatric hospital. He meets many other patients, some friendly, others reclusive or delusional, and is supported and encouraged by his family and school principal once they learn of his hospitalization. Craig meets Noelle, a female patient who coped with a history of sexual abuse by cutting her face with scissors. In isolation from the outside world, and with help from Noelle, Craig confronts the sources of his anxiety and regains his health. During his recovery, Craig experiments with art, specifically stylized maps, and discovers he has a great deal of natural talent and ability. Once Craig has recovered, his counselor suggests he transfer to an art school, a thought that excites Craig. At the end of the novel, having undergone a mental "shift", he returns home. He narrates that his brain now tells him that he wants to "live", and he says he now wants to "do". He then begins to list the things he wants to do, such as eat, sleep, run, walk, kiss, and read, among others.
