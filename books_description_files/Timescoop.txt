The novel expresses Brunner in a lighter mode than other novels of the period such as Stand on Zanzibar and The Sheep Look Up. The original cover copy said, "He summoned the monsters of the past to help him rule the world." Actually, protagonist Harold Freitas III is merely looking for a publicity triumph, and the "monsters" are duplicates of his own ancestors, brought forward to 2066 by a newly invented time machine. The ancestors have some difficulties, amusingly described, in adjusting to 21st-century mores. Freitas and his sentient computer SPARCI save the day.
