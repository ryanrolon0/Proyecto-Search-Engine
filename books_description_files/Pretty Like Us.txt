Beauty McElwrath dreads going back to school this year. She has no friends to speak of and her teacher is also her mother’s boyfriend. She dreads it even more when she meets Alane Shriver, who suffers from an aging disease. Beauty ends up making fun of her, just like people have made fun of Beauty in the past, in order to try to gain friends. She runs away from school twice to forget some of the mean things that she is willing to do in hopes of gaining friendship. Her mother, grandmother and teacher all encourage her to make friends with Alane, but Beauty fears the disapproval of her classmates. She must realize that she wants to be friends with Alane on her own. She eventually makes friends with Alane through an illegal midnight drive to the beach and an incident with a wild pig running into Beauty’s mother’s prized car. However, Beauty is embarrassed by being friends with Alane when they are at school and says she is sorry about her actions in front of the entire classroom in order to regain Alane's friendship.

Meanwhile, Alane gets sick and Beauty finds out that not only does Alane look very old, her body itself is very old and she is slowly dying. Beauty both finds and learns how to deal with losing her best friend; and Alane finally found a friend and fulfills her own dream by the end of the both, with a little help.
