Moomintroll and his friend Sniff go into the forest and find a mysterious path. They follow it and meet the Silk Monkey. They go pearl fishing, and then discover a cave. However, they get scared when they visit the cave later and see a comet drawn with the pearls, which the Muskrat tells Moomintroll may destroy the valley. So they sail to the observatory in the Lonely Mountains to ask the Professors if the comet will destroy the Earth. They are attacked by crocodiles who are distracted by their trousers. They then meet Snufkin, who joins them, and Sniff has a run-in with a giant lizard after he tries to steal its garnets. The boat gets stuck in a cave and they almost fall into a dark hole when they are rescued by a Hemulen with butterfly net. They find the observatory, and the scientists tell them the exact time that the comet will arrive. Moomintroll saves the Snork Maiden from a deadly bush, then she and her brother Snork join them on their way back to Moominvalley. They buy gifts in a store, then attend a dance in the forest. The comet heat dries up the sea, and the group has to cross on stilts. On the way they meet another Hemulen, who follows them home. Moominmamma has baked a welcome home cake. The family flees to a cave, along with the Muskrat, Silk Monkey, and the Hemulen. However, the comet misses Moominvalley. The friends rejoice.
