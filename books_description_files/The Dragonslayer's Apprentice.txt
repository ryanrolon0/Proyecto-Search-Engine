The novel is written primarily about a girl called Jackie, later revealed to be formally named Jacqueline, who has convinced a man known only in the book as "the Dragonslayer" to allow her to be his apprentice and to work with her along with his taciturn assistant, Ron. At the beginning, the Dragonslayer repeatedly thinks he should not have accepted her as his apprentice, believing himself mad to have taken on not only a woman, but a teenage girl, but as the story progresses, he becomes more comfortable with her and sees she really is not bad at the job of a Dragonslayer. The Dragonslayer, after he had already accepted Jackie as his apprentice, learns from Jackie that she is the daughter of a noble family who ran away because she was far too bored doing lady-like things all day. He believes most of her story, but right away thinks that she is actually from a royal family, a princess; he also manages to confirm and let Jackie know he knows, without outright asking or saying such. Near the end of the novel, the Dragonslayer and Ron are quickly told by the country's palace's chamberlain that Jackie is indeed a princess. She is allowed to receive her Dragonslayer's cape from her father, the king, and he expresses his pride and that of the kingdom in her for becoming the first female dragonslayer ever. In this book, dragons do not breathe fire, but do give off a black vapor that people usually think is smoke. The author also alludes in passing to the idea that advanced people are should be more perceptive and need to say less to communicate more, as Ron does.
