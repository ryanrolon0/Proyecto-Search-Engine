The book's narrator, Jim Burden, arrives in the town of Black Hawk, Nebraska, on the same train as the Shimerdas, when he goes to live with his grandparents after his parents have died. Jim develops strong feelings for 햚tonia, something between a crush and a filial bond, and the reader views 햚tonia's life, including its attendant struggles and triumphs, through that lens. The novel is divided into five books, some of which incorporate short stories Cather had previously written, based on her own life growing up on the Nebraska prairies. The volumes correspond roughly to the stages of 햚tonia's life up through her marriage and motherhood, although the third volume, "Lena Lingard," focuses more on Jim's time in college and his affair with Lena, another childhood friend of his, who is also 햚tonia's friend. The five books, in order, are: # The Shimerdas - the longest book within the novel. It covers Jim's early years spent on his grandparents' farm, out on the prairie. # The Hired Girls - the second longest section of the novel. It covers Jim's time in town, when he spends time with 햚tonia and the other country girls who work in town. Language, particularly descriptions, begin to become more sexualized, particularly concerning 햚tonia and Lena. # Lena Lingard - this chronicles Jim's time at the university, and the period in which he becomes reacquainted with Lena Lingard. # The Pioneer Woman's Story - Jim visits the Harlings and hears about 햚tonia's fateful romance with Larry Donovan. This is the shortest book. # Cuzak's Boys - Jim goes to visit 햚tonia and meets her new family, her children and husband.
