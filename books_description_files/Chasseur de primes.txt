Following a short introductional treaty on the general status of bounty hunters in the Old West, we get introduced to the titular character, Elliot Belt, a notorious and unscrupulous representative of his trade. His current target is Tea Spoon, the Cheyenne caretaker of the horse ranch of Bronco Fortworth, who is accused of stealing the rancher's price stallion, Lord Washmouth III; the bounty has been set at a dizzying $100,000. Not caring about whether or not Tea Spoon is innocent, Belt takes up the task of hunting him down, while Lucky Luke tries his best to stop him. Eventually, Elliot Belt himself ends up on the wrong side of the law as he nearly triggers a war with Tea Spoon's tribe to get his hands on the bounty, and now he is pushed into the role of the hunted.
