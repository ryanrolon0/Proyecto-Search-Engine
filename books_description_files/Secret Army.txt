Back in England, CHERUB campus has been established and Marc, PT, Paul and Rosie are in the first of two teams of six recruits currently being trained. Luc and Joel two new characters and the other two members of Group A. However, Henderson is warned that unless the first group of recruits pass a difficult training course, the programme will be shut down for good. While Group A learn to parachute and undertake a mission on British soil, Henderson must win the support of his commanding officers, while placating his unstable wife Joan.
