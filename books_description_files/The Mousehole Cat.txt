One very stormy winter, none of the fishermen of the village of Mousehole () in Cornwall have been able to leave the harbour for a long while and the village is near starvation. Tom Bawcock and his loyal black and white cat, Mowzer, decide to brave the storms and set sail to catch some fish. When the boat hits the storm, it is represented by a giant "Storm-Cat", which allows Mowzer to eventually save the day by soothing the storm with her purring. This purring becomes a song and while the Storm-Cat is resting Tom is able to haul in his catch and return to harbour. When they arrive back at the village, the entire catch is baked into a "Star-Gazy" pie, on which the villagers feast.
