Joachim buys a magic advent calendar on November 30 and every day, a piece of paper falls out of the door of the calendar. Each page tells the story of Elisabet Hansen, who chases a toy lamb that has come to life from an Oslo department store. While chasing the lamb, she meets the angel Ephiriel; the shepherds Joshua and Jacob; Caspar, the King of the Orient; and the cherub Impuriel.
