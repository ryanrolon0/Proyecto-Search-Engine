Joe Stoshack's biggest love is baseball. He knows everything there is to know about the game -- except how to play well. When he takes a job cleaning a bunch of junk out of his neighbor's attic, he finds a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner card (the most valuable baseball card in the world). He tries to verify that it is an authentic Wagner by going to a collectible shop. The owner, an ex "bad guy" professional wrestler named Birdie Farrell, tries to trick him into selling it for ten dollars by saying it's Heinie Wagner. When he goes to sleep that night, he's holding the baseball card, wishing he could meet Honus. The next day, after one of his team's games, Joe finds himself face to face with baseball legend Honus Wagner. He plays catch with him, and Joe and Honus share what their dreams are. Joe's is to play in the big leagues, while Honus' is to win the World Series. Together they travel back in time -- into the seventh game of the World Series -- where Honus helps Joe boost his self-esteem and gain confidence in his ability to play baseball.
