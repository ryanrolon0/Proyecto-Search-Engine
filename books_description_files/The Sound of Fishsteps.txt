Turkish prodigy Afife Piri, a descendent of Ottoman-Turkish cartographer Piri Reis, is invited, along with 87 other international selects, to take part in a UN sponsored retreat in an unnamed Scandinavian city. At the retreat she encounters a man claiming to be the French novelist Romain Gary, with whom she falls in love, and the descendents of other iconoclastic geniuses including Joan of Arc, Anaïs Nin, Nehru and Edvard Grieg. The mysterious director of the retreat, Dr. Gunnar, however, has a secret agenda that is slowly revealed.
