At the age of 19 Rose is in love with the passionate but penniless Mylo Cooper, but agrees to marriage Ned Peel. She doesn't love Ned, but it's the safe thing to do. Ned has inherited a country house called Slepe from an uncle and the married couple moves in shortly after the wedding. Rose immediately falls in love with the house and its garden, if not with its owner. During the war Ned is away from the house a lot and her real love, Mylo, starts visiting her at Slepe. They go on meeting each other secretly throughout all 48 years of Rose's marriage until her husband dies.Shortly after her husband's death Rose leaves Slepe, her beloved home throughout half a century (now her son's and not so beloved daughter in law's), taking only a few things with her. Temporarily installed in a hotel room Rose starts looking back on her life. Her marriage has been a marriage of convenience; she has never been passionately in love with her husband. However, on their wedding night she promised him that she would never leave him - a promise she could never break. Now, at the age of 67 she is free - and don't know where she is going in life.
