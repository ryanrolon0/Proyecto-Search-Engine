According to Pier Anthony's newsletter,"Two to the Fifth" is "the story of Cyrus Cyborg, a playwright who is considered a catch by several of the lovely actresses in his plays. The Princess Rhythm, age twelve, confesses to having a crush on him. He refuses to take that seriously; she's a child. Bad mistake; she's also a Sorceress. Never antagonize a Sorceress of any age. She enchants herself to be ten years older, grabs him, and hauls him into a love spring. Gives one heroic ellipsis... And reverts to her normal age after an hour, leaving him hopelessly in love with a woman who won't exist for another decade. But the stork, having received the signal, brings her a baby. There are reasons for the dread Adult Conspiracy that children don't necessarily appreciate. Then it gets complicated. Even when unapproachably young—Cyrus naturally honors the Adult Conspiracy throughout—and with a daughter who can't be explained to others, the princess proves to be a dangerously jealous lover, and Cyrus is constantly wary. Aside from this incidental interaction, there is the challenge of Ragna Roc, who means to take over Xanth in a dramatic final battle, or destroy it. He does have the power. The three princesses together, their magic cubed, take him on in the finale without any certainty of winning."
