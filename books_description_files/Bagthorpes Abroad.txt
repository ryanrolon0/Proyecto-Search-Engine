Mr Bagthorpe sets off to write a script about ghosts and decides to get inspiration from renting a haunted house for the summer holidays. After some mis-understanding, Henry's family realizes that 'abroad' is Wales. With Mrs Fosdyke tagging along with her portable pantry, the latter arrives at Ty Cillion Duon. The house has huge holes in the roof, a blackened sink in the 'kitchen', and of course, ghosts. The Bagthorpes never actually see the ghosts, but do feel them.
