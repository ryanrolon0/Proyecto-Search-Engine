Ulf is a young werewolf who lives at Farraway Hall, where he and hundreds of other endangered beasts are protected by the RSPCB (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Beasts). When Professor Farraway, the founder of the RSPCB, died, he left his fortune and estate to the society. His son, Baron Marackai, believed he deserved the contents of his father's will and he's made it his life's ambition to take revenge on the RSPCB. A man named Inspector Black shows up at Farraway hall claiming to be investigating the murder of a baby dragon. He believes that the culprit shot the baby dragon in order to lure the mother dragon into a trap. The killer was planning to erect a Ring of Horrors where two endangered beasts battled to the death before a crowd of spectators. But Ulf sees through Inspector Black's facade. Ulf believes he has too much information about the dragon killer's intentions to for an innocent investigator. Inspector Black has his hand in these dirty dealings, and it's up to Ulf to prove it.
