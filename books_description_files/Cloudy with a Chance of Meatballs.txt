The book is about a story that a kindly and elderly grandfather tells to his grandchildren about the town of Chewandswallow, where the weather comes three times a day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and is always food and beverages. The rain is juice and soup, the snow is ice cream, and the wind brings hamburgers. Because of this phenomenon, there are no grocery stores. However, the weather soon takes a turn for the worse, at first simply just giving the people disgusting things, like pea soup fog, soggy green beans and Brussels sprout cakes. However, it quickly becomes catastrophic, and the portion sizes of the food grow to massive sizes, and the entire island is bombarded with a severe amount of food that completely buries buildings, crushes homes and blocks traffic. The people decide to use stale bread and pizza to build boats to escape from Chewandswallow, while they still have a chance before the weather completely destroys the island. Soon, the population of Chewandswallow arrive in a new town, where they struggle to adapt to their new lives in the world where the sky doesn't bring food.
