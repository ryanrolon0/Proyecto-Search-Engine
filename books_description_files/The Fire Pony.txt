Roy and his big brother, Joe, are on the run from when they fetch up at the Bar None ranch. Their shared passion for horses soon wins them great respect, and Roy is offered the chance of a lifetime, to break in a wild pony that runs like the desert wind. He is even promised that if he can ride Lady Luck, he can keep her- a dream come true. But Roy knows that Joe has a dangerous secret.... a dark obsession that could explode at any time and send Roy's dream, and their whole world, up in smoke.
