The IHOP Papers follows the life of Francesca, a disgruntled twenty year-old lesbian virgin, originally from Southern California who falls in love with her female junior college professor, Irene. After spending some time together, Francesca is informed by Irene of the professor's plan to undertake a sabbatical in San Francisco, a move that will involve residing with two of Irene's former students —a woman named Jenny and a man named Gustavo— who are both Irene's "lovers". Not wishing to be apart from Irene, Francesca decides to also move to San Francisco, following a confession in which she reveals her amorous feelings to Irene in a letter. Once in San Francisco, Francesca moves in with Irene, Jenny, and Gustavo who reside in an apartment they have nicknamed "Simplicity House". The dwelling represents simple living and nonviolence. Without employment, Francesca proceeds to search for a job and eventually undertakes the role of hostess at the IHOP restaurant; however, she is quickly promoted to a waitressing position. Following a month in San Francisco, Francesca leaves Simplicity House in order to set up her own apartment. The remainder of the story follows Francesca during her intense love for Irene. Along the way, and while still in love with Irene, Francesca falls in love with other women, including Jenny, Maria, Francesca's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, and at least two other women. A significant portion of the book is devoted to Francesca's loathing for her IHOP work, including the uniform she dislikes wearing. The novel is written using a first-person narrative and Francesca is portrayed as writing the story in her apartment after her relocation to San Francisco.
