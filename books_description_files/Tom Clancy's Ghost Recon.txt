In the first novelization of the Ghost Recon franchise by Ubisoft/Tom Clancy, the Ghosts infiltrate China's eastern coast to seek and destroy the Spring Tiger Group. The small band of renegade Chinese military leaders is poised to execute Operation Pouncing Dragon, a plot to seize Taiwan and trigger a battle for dominance in the Pacific. Led by Captain Scott Mitchell, the Ghosts wage war from the Southern Philippines, Northwest Waziristan, and Xiamen, China, coping with the impact of unforeseen tragedy, remembering lessons-learned, and treasuring camaraderie. But during Operation War Wrath in Xiamen, China, a decade-old tragedy resurfaces endangering the mission and the team. The Spring Tiger Group is aided by an old nemesis and for Mitchell; this war gets very personal.
