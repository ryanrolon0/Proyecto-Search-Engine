Spenser has to protect the image of Ronni Alexander, Congressman Meade Alexander's wife. The Congressman, who is running for senator, is being blackmailed, but is interested only in making sure that his wife suffers no setbacks because of the videotape. Spenser's efforts take him to Washington, where he narrows down the suspects to Gerry Broz, the Boston mobster Joe Broz's son, who is running a sex and drug racket, in which Mrs. Alexander had gotten filmed. Joe Brox has Congressman Alexander's rival, Robert Browne in his pocket, and intends to make sure that he wins over Alexander. Spenser finds out that Joe has no idea of his son's racket in Washington and uses this as leverage in order to get the tapes suppressed, managing to get shot in the leg in the course of the story. This book shows the first sighs of some distance between Spenser and Susan Silverman. Susan has been in Washington pursuing a Ph. D in Clinical Psychology, and Spenser gets scared of the loneliness that he feels without her. He also feels that she is conforming to every form of establishment that he hates. Paul Giacomin also plays a big role in this novel. He is shown to be a highly thoughtful young man who is wise beyond his age. Paul points out many things to Spenser about himself and his unbending code of ethics, and helps Spenser reach some sort of a resolution about Susan.
