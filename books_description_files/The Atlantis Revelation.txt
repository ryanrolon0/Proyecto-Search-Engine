The events of Novel Two leave the Alignment exposed & removed from the US Government, an ancient Celestial Globe in the hands of the Pentagon, a Terrestrial one in the hands of the Vatican, Conrad still searching for links to Atlantis & Serena the new leader of a Catholic sect with ties to the remaining Alignment leaders in Europe. When Conrad discovers the remains of a German sub containing a powerful Atlantean weapon that uses water as fuel for an explosion, he is headed off by Alignment member & Russian Petrol Tycoon, Roman "Midas" Midasovitch. This lures Conrad into another conflict with the Alignment that draws him deeper into the Alignment than ever before. Meanwhile, Serena Seghetti tries to enter the Alignment's ranks in order to gain their trust & expose their remaining leaders to the world- all she has to do is deliver both globes to the Castle of the Grand Master in time for the Summit Meeting, where the Alignment will convene in secret for the first time in centuries- but Conrad's reappearance screws up her plans, as well as his when he sacrifices his own life to keep her safe & uncover the Alignment's plans for Armagheddon. The Novel leaves off with both Conrad & Serena presumable dead after failing to stop a controlled explosion beneath Jeruselem that was meant to start a holy war, yet it is revealed that both have survived & wish to continue their lives in secret- together, away from the Alignment, the Government & the church that held them captive for so long.
