The village of Frip, consisting of three shacks by the sea, relies entirely on the production and sale of goat's milk. The gappers, an unintelligent lifeform shaped like a spiky fish, crawl up from the sea and sit on the backs of the goats. The gappers are so excited about the goats that they emit a loud, high-pitched noise that never ceases. The families must pluck the gappers from the goats' backs and throw them back into the sea.
