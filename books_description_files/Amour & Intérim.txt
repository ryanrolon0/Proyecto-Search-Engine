This adventure takes place in modern France and uses the normal continuing storyline of the series. The Damoclès company, a mysterious organisation whose goals and methods are not entirely clear, suddenly offers a job as managing director to Lapinot, even though he doesn't know anything about the company. After originally declining the job, he hesitates and finally accepts, partly because he thinks a job in the same town as Nadia, a woman he met during winter holidays in Slaloms, will help him start a relationship with her.
