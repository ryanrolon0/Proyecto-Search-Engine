This book is the follow-up to the jointly written Our Story by both Ronnie and Reggie Kray. In this book, Ronnie describes in his own words the murders of Jack "the Hat" McVitie and George Cornell; his bisexuality, and his feelings about spending 30 years in Broadmoor Hospital for the criminally insane. Also included is a chapter written by Ronnie's wife, Kate Kray, and 21 photographs depicting the young Krays, their family, friends and victims. Quote from book: "They were the best years of our lives. They called them the swinging Sixties. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones were the rulers of pop music, Carnaby Street ruled the fashion world... and me and my brother ruled London. We were fucking untouchable..." - Ronnie Kray.
