He completed her last terrible spell, causing his own doom, and embroiled a group of powerful adventurers in Nuala’s plot to gain allies for her bid for power in the Ffenargh. Nuala now plans to use these adventurers and her own new powers to overthrow the creaky clerical hierarchy of Eylea and rule the Ffenargh. The adventure includes statistics for new monsters, the slime golem, and the life-bane duplicates.
