The story is of two knights imprisoned by Theseus after being found unconscious after a battle. Theseus locks Palamon and Arcite in a dungeon where the two knights can see into a courtyard or garden. One day Palamon, looking through the bars of his cell, sees Emily. Falling in love instantly, Palamon cries out, causing Arcite to ask his friend what is wrong. Palamon declares his new found love for Emily, and as Arcite listens, he sees Emily. Turning to Palamon, Arcite claims that because he first recognized her as mortal and not a goddess, Arcite has the right to woo Emily. Later, one of Arcite's friends begs Theseus to free his prisoner; Theseus agrees, but banishes Arcite. The love-struck knight returns, disguised as one of Theseus's servants. The story unfolds as each knight endures different challenges to prove his love for Emily.
