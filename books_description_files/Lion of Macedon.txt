As the story opens, Tamis, a sorceress, is seeing the future. She discovers that only a mixed-blood Spartan called Parmenion can help her. Parmenion is a half-blood Spartan whose mother is from Macedon. He is an accomplished runner and a strategic genius, yet he is despised by the young Spartan nobles. He is forced to kill a love rival in duel, subsequently forcing him to flee to Thebes. There, Parmenion starts a new life as a professional runner, but also gets involved with Thebian rebels attempting to overthrow the Spartan garrison now residing in the city center. This ultimately leads to an extended war between to the two city states, ending with Parmenion crushing the Spartan army, destroying the Spartan legend in the process. Some years later Parmenion is a famous mercenary general, winning battles all around Asia. He is then offered a chance to rebuild the Macedonian army by Philip II of Macedon. Later on the story describes the rise of Macedon under Philip II of Macedon and the birth of Alexander the Great. fr:Le Lion de Macédoine pl:Lew Macedonii
