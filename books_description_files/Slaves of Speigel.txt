Sargon the Great is the leader of planet Spiegel. Fat space pirates inhabit the planet Spiegel and they travel around the galaxy collecting fattening and unhealthy food. To discover new types of food they search for the greatest cooks in the galaxy. They bring cooks from two distant planets and one cook from Earth. The cook's name is Steve. He and his assistant Norman are brought to Spiegel along with their restaurant, The Magic Moscow. The Earth cooks are pitted against the cooks from other planets. Steve and Norman cook a dish which consists of melons from Venus, ham, radishes, pears, kosher salami, maple syrup, raw oats and olives. The competition to cook the greatest dish is fierce, but in the end Steve and Norman come in second. They are allowed to take 600 pounds of Spiegelian blue garlic, a prize Steve is quite satisfied with. He later uses it to create a new "bright blue" pizza.
