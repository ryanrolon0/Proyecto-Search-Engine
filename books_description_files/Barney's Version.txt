The story is written as if it is an autobiography by Barney Panofsky recounting his life in varying detail. At the end of the book he is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, explaining his previous memory lapses and footnote corrections by his son Michael. Barney's version of events may be viewed as that of two unreliable narrators, in that his recollections are told from varying mental states and then posthumously edited by his son. Underlying the story of Barney's three marriages is the mysterious disappearance of his friend Boogie. Though there is no body, police suspect murder, and Barney himself is tried but acquitted of murder. An explanation for the mystery is given at the novel's end.
