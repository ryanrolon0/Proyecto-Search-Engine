It is presented in the form of unfinished memoirs of one Professor Gunther Wünker, born in Ramat Gan, Israel in the 1960s, an anti-Zionist and the founder of the philosophical school of 'Peepology' (the science of peep-show voyeurism). The novel takes place in a fictitious near future period, some 40 years after the State of Israel is dismantled and replaced with a State of Palestine. The novel excoriates what it calls exploitation of The Holocaust for propaganda purposes designed to shield Israel from scrutiny for its "transgressions" against the Palestinians. The perplexed are defined as "the unthinking chosen" who "cling to clods of earth that don't belong to them". The original Hebrew version of the novel was nominated for Israel's 2003 Geffen Award for science fiction.
