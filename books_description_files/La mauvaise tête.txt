In A Head for Crime, due to a few missing passport photos, Fantasio finds himself a victim of a conspiracy to frame him as the thief of an invaluable Egyptian gold mask. Appearing completely guilty, he is forced to flee from the law, attempting escape from the city disguised as a competing bicyclist in the 6 day mountain endurance race Tour de Midiville, leaving Spirou alone with the tough task of exposing the real villains, and clearing Fantasio's name. The accompanying short story, Don't Touch the Robins, describes the Marsupilami's close relationship with little birds, while vacationing in The Count of Champignac's castle park (presumably during the events of the Marsupilami-free story La mauvaise tête).
