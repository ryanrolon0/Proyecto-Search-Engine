Cassy, who lives with her grandmother, is awakened by mysterious footsteps one night. The next day, as always when the footsteps are heard, she is sent away to live with her lovely but feckless mother, Goldie, in a squat in London. Goldie, her partner, and his teenage son are producing a play about wolves, and they encourage Cassy to become involved. Cassy does her best to adjust to her new life. However, this time she cannot escape a sense of dread: a feeling that she is being stalked and that something bad is coming. Her fear eventually focuses on the mystery of her missing father, and she learns the secret she has been protected from all her life—that her father is a notorious terrorist.
