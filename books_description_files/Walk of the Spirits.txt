Miranda Barnes "realizes that life as she knew it is officially over" when she sees the town of St. Yvette, Louisiana. She starts hearing whispers, sees shadows, and hears voices. Her school mates can tell that something is wrong with her. She realized that she has the same "special gift" that her grandfather had to communicate with the spirits, and that she needs to help them.
