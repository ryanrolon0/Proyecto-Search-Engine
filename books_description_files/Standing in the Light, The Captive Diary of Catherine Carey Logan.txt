Catherine is a thirteen year old Quaker girl who leads a simple life with her mother, father, and younger siblings that are Thomas, Eliza and Baby Will. At first she writes in her journal about school; meetings (church services); her crush, a handsome, spunky boy named Jess Owen; and her family including Baby Will's first tooth. But when the family hears about the Indian raids and massacres on nearby farms and at church, fear grows in her. Catherine is terrified to death of what may happen. Then one day while walking to school, Caty (Catherine) and Thomas are both captured by Lenape Indians. They are taken to the Lenape camp, and Thomas is separated from his sister and taken to another camp. Later, he moves to her camp after a bout with fever. Catherine is adopted by an old woman named Wapa-go-kos (White Owl) and her daughter, Tan-kan-wan (Little Cloud). Catherine is called Chilili (Snow Bird). Catherine hates her new family and their traditions and customs. But when she befriends a handsome young hunter named Wine-lo-wich (Snow Hunter) and a romance develops, she grows to love her new people. Snow hunter is English and was also captured, but he has lived with indians several years. Seasons pass, and then tragically Catherine and Thomas are torn apart from their new family, and her new love by the white men. Snow Hunter and a group who went to trade furs were murdered by white men, and Catherine and Thomas were taken back to their real home. Catherine's mom was shocked by Catherine acting like a "savage" when Catherine was captured and does not know how to treat her daughter. Catherine decides to let her father read her diary. Instead of being ashamed, he tells Catherine that he is proud of her learning to look past differences between people and for "standing in the light". It also includes an epilogue and historical note. Catherine lived in the Quaker land, then in the Lenape land.
