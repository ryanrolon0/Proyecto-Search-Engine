A boy, Humbert, goes to stay with his Uncle Bellamy. Once there he discovers a strange package that appears to hum to itself. Upon alerting his uncle to the package, Humbert is surprised to find that it contains a Type One Household Robot, designed to help around the home. The robot is swiftly named Manders by Uncle Bellamy, because he does everything that a man-does. Humbert and Manders get into all kinds of adventures, the most memorable of which is a kite flying expedition. The joy in the story for children is how Manders struggles to come to terms with human existence, for example; misunderstanding phrases like "getting along like a house on fire", not realising that a kite is not meant to take you with it, or trying to slice custard.
