O Dinheiro,play written in 1976 - and revised by the author in other opportunities - is the best-known work of dramaturgy by Miguel M. Abrahão. Combining farce, comedy and elements of detective stories, the play tells the life of a family, imprisoned for twelve years in an isolated mansion, to receive the estate of the deceased uncle Josafá Paranhos I and where all members are subordinate to a testament unconventional. Each character presents an interesting pathological deviation, all linked to the habit of collecting something (syringes, boards, men, spiders), or fixed ideas (such as ET or famous characters in American films). At the end of these twelve years, advocates of Josafá, require that hosts in the mansion, a young man intern: Alexandre Pousa. And, coincidentally with his arrival, apparently accidental deaths begin to occur at the mansion, leaving the question in the air: murders or fatalities?
