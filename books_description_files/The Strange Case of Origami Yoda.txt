The plot of OY3, as quoted by Amazon.com, "With Dwight attending Tippett Academy this semester, the kids of McQuarrie Middle School are on their own—no Origami Yoda to give advice and help them navigate the treacherous waters of middle school. Then Sara gets a gift she says is from Dwight—a paper fortune-teller in the form of Chewbacca. It’s a Fortune Wookiee, and it seems to give advice that’s just as good as Yoda’s—even if, in the hands of the girls, it seems too preoccupied with romance. In the meantime, Dwight is fitting in a little too well at Tippett. Has the unimaginable happened? Has Dwight become normal? It’s up to his old friends at McQuarrie to remind their kooky friend that it’s in his weirdness that his greatness lies." The timeframe of the book is revealed to be a few days after Darth Paper Strikes Back, an it takes place in both schools, McQuarrie Middle School, and Tippett Academy. Also, the origami guest stars who appear in the book are listed below: * Han Foldo- Chewbacca's human partner, Han Solo, finally gets into origami with Chewie in the new book! * Wicket- Either just a normal Ewok, or Wicket the Ewok, will be an Origami guest star in book 3
