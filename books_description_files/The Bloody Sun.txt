Jeff Kerwin, an orphan born on Darkover and raised on Earth, returns to his home planet Darkover as an adult. He brings with him a mysterious blue stone that he has treasured since the half-forgotten trauma of his early memories, and which proves to be the key to his true heritage and identity. The expanded rewrite retains the basic plot structure but is more closely connected to several other Darkover books, especially The Forbidden Tower. It also changes the identity of one of Kerwin's parents, although the later book Exile's Song uses his textually original parentage as background information.
