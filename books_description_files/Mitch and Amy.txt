The book centers around twin siblings, Mitch and Amy, who bicker constantly over insignificant or little things. It chronicles their average daily experiences or their opposing personalities and interests, as well as their sibling rivalry. However, it also deals with their problems with a tormentor named Alan Hibbler, who harasses them constantly for seemingly no apparent reason until a schoolyard fight leads Amy to realize that his antagonistic behaviors may be linked with his father Judson Hibbler's great notoriety and Alan's poor skills in spelling.
