Just one more week and Mary will turn 21. She will inherit property and money...but she will also be free of her awful aunt. Going in search of her mentor, Sherlock Holmes, she finds him on top of a hansom cab. Holmes reveals that he knows why Mary has sought him out - to ask him to marry her! - and he mocks her for it. Mary becomes upset and literally runs away. By chance, she meets her old college friend Veronica Beaconsfield. Veronica talks Russell in to visiting The New Temple In God to hear a woman named Margery Child preach. Margery's speeches are all about love and empowerment of women, but Mary discovers that several young ladies have died shortly after making wills in favor of the temple. Mary must try to solve the mystery of Margery Childe while surviving mysterious attacks, newfound wealth, and uncomfortable (or maybe too comfortable?) new feelings for her partner, Holmes.
