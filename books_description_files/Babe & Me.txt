Joe Stoshack goes back in time to find out whether Babe Ruth called his shot in the 1932 world series. His dad tags along to keep him safe, per his mom's request, and to try to make some money, because he has just gotten laid off. Joe Stoshack ends up meeting Babe Ruth right after almost getting killed by a guy with a knife. Babe Ruth assumes that Joe has just saved him from an assassination attempt, so he invites Joe and his dad to come along with him. Joe's dad gets Babe Ruth to sign a bunch of baseballs, fulfilling what he wanted to do, and then they go to the baseball game, fulfilling what Joe wanted to do. However, Joe's dad sees presidentential hopeful Franklin Roosevelt (Who was elected president a month later) in the stands, and tries to warn him about the Holocaust. But security guards see him as a potential assassin, and take him away. Joe ends up watching the game and discovers that Babe Ruth really did call his shot and then gets re-united with his dad. His dad's sack of baseballs that got signed by Babe Ruth were confiscated, but he doesn't care because he got to spend some quality time with his son, something that almost never happens. Then they return to the present and Joe Stoshack hits a Walk-Off home run in his next Little League game, somewhat mirroring Babe Ruth's home run.
