Jack Havoc, ex-army, jail-breaker and knife artist, is on the loose on the streets of London once again. In the faded squares of shabby houses, in the furtive alleys and darkened pubs, the word is out that he is back in town, more vicious and cunning than ever. It falls to Albert Campion and Inspector Charles Luke to pit their wits against the killer and hunt him down through the city's November smog before it is too late. Havoc's pursuit of a "treasure" leads him from London ("the Smoke") to Normandy. There Havoc discovers that the treasure is not what he thought it was. The book climaxes in his death.
