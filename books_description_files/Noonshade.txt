At the end of the last book Denser had cast dawnthief to destroy the Wytch Lords, and just to make sure they don't come back he opened a dimensional rip leading to nowhere. But unknowingly he had it opening into Sha-kaan's (the golden dragon in the last book) dimension. In this book the Raven have to close the dimensional rip hovering above Parve, which is growing. If they fail then the Khaan brood won't be able to hold the other, larger broods off.
