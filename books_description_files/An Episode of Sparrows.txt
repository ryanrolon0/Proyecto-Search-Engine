The novel focuses on children in Catford Street, a working-class London street of much stone and asphalt but only few green spots. A difficult young girl named Lovejoy Mason, living with the aspiring restaurateur and his wife with whom her irresponsible mother has left her, finds a packet of cornflower seeds and plants a small garden in a wrecked churchyard, filled with rubble from the Blitz. Although other children dislike her, Tip Malone, the boss of a boys’ gang, takes an interest in Lovejoy and her small project. Ultimately, several adults become involved in the children's lives as a result of Lovejoy's garden, with significant consequences for their future.
