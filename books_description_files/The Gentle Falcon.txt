Isabella Clinton is the daughter and only child of a French noblewoman, from the House of Valois, and an English soldier. With her father dead, she's heir to his estate, but much prefers working in the fields than learning to be a proper noblewoman - and this is made clear from her sharp tongue and blunt way of speaking. After the death of her father, it seems that the Black Prince has forgotten Isabella and her mother. It is quite a long time before Isabella is finally summoned to court by King Richard - and when she finally is, it is to be companion to her young kinswoman, Isabella of the House of Valois, Madame of France and soon to be Queen of England. It is through Isabella Clinton's eyes that we see the love Isabella of France develops for King Richard. Although only seven years old at her first appearance, the Queen shows maturity for her age - but what happens to her throughout the book causes her great sorrow, even though she doesn't show it on the outside.
