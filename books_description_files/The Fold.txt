Joyce Park is a Korean adult who just finished her junior year of high school. On the last day of school she asked the boy she had a crush on to sign her yearbook, when he does so, he absent-mindedly addresses her by the name of a more academically inclined and ugly classmate. Determined to break out of her shell Joyce sets about a program of self-improvement along with the help of her best friend Gina. Hampered by her family, working in her family’s restaurant, and trying to stand out of her older sister’s shadow, she is given a chance to have plastic surgery, a gift from her aunt, who has just won the lottery. If Joyce undergoes blepharoplasty she will have more European-looking eyes with a prominent eyelid fold, making her stand out from other Korean immigrants, but she is afraid of any kind of pain, which causes a major problem.
