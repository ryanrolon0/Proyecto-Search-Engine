The novel in its original version is strikingly similar to American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, from the many prolonged descriptions of the clothes worn by the characters to specific scenes such as Ross dispensing advice on the right shoe to wear with chinos, which is taken almost word-for-word from a similar passage in Ellis's work. Much of this content was removed in the revised edition as the comedic aspect of the series came to the fore.
