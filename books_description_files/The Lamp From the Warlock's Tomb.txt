Anthony Monday and Myra Eells live in Minnesota, where odd things begin to occur after the purchase of an antique oil lamp. Late one night at his high school, Anthony burns the lamp as part of his science project and, later, when leaving the school, sees a strange-looking cobweb-covered apparition. Anthony flees in terror but trips over the dead body of the school's watchman. Later, while walking home from the library, Anthony sees the withered corpse of the watchman in an antique shop. Ms. Eells confides in her brother Emerson, an expert in the occult, about the strange lamp and the even stranger sights and sounds seemingly ignited by the lamp. Emerson soon discovers the oil lamp is one of three items (à la bell, book, and candle) that are keeping a sinister spirit at bay.
