The man with the yellow hat buys George a bicycle. He helps a newspaper boy with his route, but makes boats of the newspapers and sets them adrift in a stream. He runs into a rock, damaging the bike's front wheel. Workers with an animal show fix the wheel and George joins the show. He is given a bugle to play. He is told not to feed the ostrich but the bird gets the bugle lodged in his throat. The workers retrieve it, but George is fired. A baby bear escapes and climbs a tree. George rescues him by lowering him to the ground in the newspaper bag. For his heroism, George is reinstated in the show. He rides his bike and plays the bugle. He is a great success, and is allowed to keep the bugle.
