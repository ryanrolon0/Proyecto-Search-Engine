The Soviet Union invades and occupies a sparsely-populated Pacific atoll and proceeds to kill the inhabitants and gradually construct a missile and submarine base. This is perceived as a major threat to the United States, which is called upon to respond. When diplomacy fails, the United States must respond militarily if anything is to be done. Plans to do so, though, are frustrated by infighting within Congress, the Pentagon, and elsewhere in the government. When the novel ends, the U.S. has failed to respond and the Soviets have consolidated their hold on the atoll.
