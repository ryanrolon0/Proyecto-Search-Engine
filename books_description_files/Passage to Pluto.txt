Chris Godfrey is now deputy-director of UNEXA; he sends his former crew-mates to investigate unexplained perturbations in the orbit of Pluto. They discover that not only are their fuel tanks holed, but a super-dense wandering planet is on course to decimate the Solar system... This was the last of Hugh Walter's 'exploration' novels as his realistic approach could not envisage travel further afield.
