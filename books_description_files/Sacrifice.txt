The book starts where Exile left off, with Ben returning to Jacen aboard the Sith Meditation Sphere he found on Ziost. The novel follows Jacen as he manipulates politics, introducing a new law that allows him to rewrite other laws. Using this and Cal Omas' betrayal to the Galactic Alliance as leverage, he and Admiral Niathal stage a bloodless coup, arresting Omas and installing themselves as joint Chiefs of State. At the same time, Jacen sends Ben to assassinate Dur Gejjen, throwing the Corellian-led Confederation into chaos. Meanwhile, Boba Fett and Mirta Gev are still in search of a cure to Fett's illness after finding Kad Skirata, the son of a clone. In exchange for the promise of making the Mandalorians a united people, he cures Boba, giving him another thirty or so years to live. Ben overhears a conversation between Lumiya and Jacen and, horrified, confesses all to his mother, Mara Jade Skywalker. Mara, livid with Jacen for attempting to turn Ben to the dark side, sets out to kill him. This backfires, however, as Jacen kills Mara as his final sacrifice. This sacrifice kills Ben's love for Jacen, making the prophecy complete. Thinking that Lumiya killed Mara, Luke hunts her down and kills her. Ben then reveals that Mara's killer could not have been Lumiya, since Ben was with her at the time. At the end of the book, Jacen Solo assumes his Sith name: Darth Caedus.
