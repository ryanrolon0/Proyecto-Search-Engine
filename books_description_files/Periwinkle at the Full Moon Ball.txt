A young rabbit named Periwinkle Bellflower ("Agaric Passiflore" in the French version) learns of the summertime Full Moon Ball that will soon take place in the community of Beechwood Grove. Unlike the other rabbits in his family, he cannot dance, and this makes him sad. But, with the help of a conniving magpie, Magda, and a wood pigeon and a frog as his teachers, he soon learns how to do so in a couple of days. On the night of the Ball, Periwinkle takes centre stage with his moves, unaware of Madga's plan: the whole of Beechwood is supposed to laugh at him in embarrassment. However, a white owl in the audience exposes the magpie's trick. Recognising his steps, she asks Periwinkle to dance them again, much to the joy of his family and the other rabbits. He continues until dawn, when the Bellflowers return home.
