That sole story, "The Return of the Half-Man", is a science-fiction spy thriller concerning a cyborg renegade military general named Mace who kidnaps the U.S. president and impersonates him at a United Nations assembly in an attempt to ignite a world war. The story and art were more graphically violent than comic books and movies of the day, is with one panel showing a pulped and bloody crushed hand and another showing a metal gun-barrel smashing through a man's teeth and sending teeth flying. "Savage depends on only two things: guys and his .357 magnum, which he has no compunction about using," one critic wrote of the 1982 reissue."Broken noses, splintering teeth, and splattering brains are all depicted in lurid detail They are part and parcel of Savage's obdurate attempts to stop a madman from instigating World War III. Although this is an old theme, Kane and Goodwin present a tale that is riveting and upsettingly believable."
