A mysterious distress call leads to the USS Enterprise being attacked by the same forces assaulting the other ship. Dozens of Enterprise crew members die in the attack and Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy is critically injured. Although the Doctor recovers from his injuries physically, mentally he has lost of all sense of his former identity. Kirk discovers it is much more difficult tracking down their new enemies without McCoy's always valued advice.
