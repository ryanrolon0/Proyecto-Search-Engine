Granta Omega is an evil mastermind who has one goal: to help the Sith destroy the Jedi order. Now, Omega has escaped to the planet of Korriban, graveyard of the ancient Sith and home to their most powerful secrets. It's up to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to intercept this madman before his sinister power grows out of control. Accompanying the pair on this mission is Anakin's rival, Ferus Olin. The competitive Anakin sees the search for Omega as a contest to be won. But such thoughts are unbecoming of a Jedi, and as the quest plunges deeper into the dark side, Jedi disciplines may be all that stave off the inevitable outcome of this showdown: Death.
