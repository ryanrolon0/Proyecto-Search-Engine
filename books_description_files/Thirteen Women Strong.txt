This book revolves around Northern Kentucky University's women's basketball team and their 2006-2007 season. In this book, Dr. Wallace reveals the internal and external struggles that these young ladies had to face as student athletes. This book delivers the success and hardships endured by young women on a journey towards more than just a national championship. Most would think this book is only about basketball, but this story conveys how Nancy Winstel facilitated the growth of players into professional women. She shows her players how basketball can not only teach you how to set goals but to achieve them, both on and off the court. These players balanced class, winning and losing games, injuries, their personal lives, Coach Winstel's attitude as well as opposing teams. The previous year they were knocked out of the playoffs by a team they knew they could beat, and decided a stand had to be made. This book is about their stand to win.
