Memories of Ice takes place simultaneously with the events of Deadhouse Gates, beginning about four months after the events of Gardens of the Moon. On the continent of Genabackis, the Malazan 2nd Army under High Fist Dujek Onearm has turned renegade and is now known as 'Onearm's Host'. Fearing the advance of a powerful new empire in the south-east of Genabackis, the Pannion Domin, Dujek and his second-in-command, Whiskeyjack, forge an alliance with their former enemies - Anomander Rake and the Tiste Andii of Moon's Spawn, and the warlord Caladan Brood. They also seek the aid of the White Face Barghast tribes. Meanwhile, the former Claw agent Toc the Younger and the T'lan Imass Tool find themselves lost in the southern wilds of Genabackis and must undertake a daring journey through Pannion territory, whilst the famed Grey Swords of Elingarth must defend the city of Capustan against a vast, overwhelming Pannion army.
