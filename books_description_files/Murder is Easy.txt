Luke Fitzwilliam happens to share a London bound train carriage with Miss Pinkerton, a seemingly dotty but sweet elderly lady, who reminds Luke of his own aunt. She talks to him about a series of murders—disguised as accidents—taking place in her home village of Wychwood-under-Ashe. Miss Pinkerton says that although the local police are out of their depth, she knows the identity of the murderer because of a telling gaze that this person fixes on the intended victim. Now that the murderer has set their sights on the local doctor, she is on her way to Scotland Yard to reveal the guilty party and save the doctor. Unfortunately, she does not inform Luke who the murderer is. Luke learns the next day that Miss Pinkerton was killed in a hit-and-run car accident before reaching the Yard. Though he is initially unsuspicious the death of the doctor does surprise him. He goes to the village, posing as a folklore researcher, to find the murderer himself. Four main suspects soon present themselves: a creepy antique dealer, a prickly solicitor, a smug doctor and a bombastic, self-made peer engaged to an attractive young woman; but is the culprit one of the other inhabitants of the village, which emanates a pervasive supernatural atmosphere that unsettles Luke's detective work?
