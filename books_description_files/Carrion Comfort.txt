The premise of the novel is that a small number of humans are born with the Ability, which gives them the power to take control of others, mind and body. These psychic vampires vary in the strength of their gift, but most have been corrupted by it and are extremely dangerous. Not only do they use others as tools or sources of amusement, they quickly discover that they gain energy from the act, "feeding" from the emotions of those they control - and feeding most successfully when their victims are tormented or forced into acts of violence. Thus, many of the most violent and inexplicable human actions are actually signs of these mind vampires at work. Saul Laski, a former victim, is determined to track down the Nazi who used the Ability to torment him. In the course of his quest, he begins to uncover a series of deadly power struggles and intrigues that are rocking the secretive world of the mind vampires. es:Los vampiros de la mente fr:L'Échiquier du mal
