Chatwin's novel portrays the life of a fictional slave trader named Francisco Manuel da Silva, who is loosely based on the life of an historical Brazilian, Francisco Felix de Sousa. He became powerful in Wydah (or Ouidah), the so-called Slave Coast of West Africa, now Benin and Togo. (Note: Chatwin was caught up in the violence of a coup in Dahomey (now Benin) when he was researching the book.)
