Martin Brady, at age 14, flees to Mexico from Texas after he kills the man who murdered his father. Now, fourteen years later, in 1880s Mexico, he is called Martin Bredi. He is a hired gun for a rich Mexican rancher and Chihuahuan warlord, Cipriano Castro. Brady starts to feel like he would like to return to Texas. Castro send him north to Puerto, Texas, to guard a load of silver ore, with the intention of smuggling arms back to the Castros. When he gets to Texas he breaks his leg and has to stay put in the town while he heals. He is approached by the head of the Texas Ranger Division in Puerto about joining after the Captain confirms his identity and lets him know that he, Brady will not be prosecuted for killing his father's murderer. He also is enamored by the ranger captain's daughter, Louisa Rucker. After killing a man who injured a friend, he returns to Mexico again, and is sent on an impossible errand to deliver a load of gunpowder by General Marco Castro, the brother of Cipriano. The wagon blows up before it is delivered. After returning to Chihuahua, Cipriano Castro sends Brady on an errand to assassinate a rival Salcido, however the Castros are suspicious of him and have him followed. During his sojourn in Chihuahua, he meets an acquaintance from Puerto and learns that the man he killed was a criminal with a reward for his death. Wanted in the United States and now distrusted in Mexico, he makes his way back to Texas and on the way assists a lost column of Buffalo soldiers that is deep into Mexico fighting Apache Indians. Back in Texas Brady joins the Texas Rangers, as part of a deal for his being a wanted man, and helps them fight the Apaches back in Mexico. A crucial character to the story is Brady's horse, a black Andalusian stallion named Lágrimas ("tears").
