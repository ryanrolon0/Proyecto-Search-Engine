Luna follows the life of sixteen year old Regan as she keeps the secret of her older brother Liam's transgender identity. During the day, Liam is an average senior student with a job making, programming and fixing computers alongside his best friend Aly. But at night, Liam 'transforms' into Lia Marie, a girl. Later, he changes his female name to Luna, which means "moon", to reflect that his true identity could only be seen at night. After years of ‘transforming’ only at night, Liam confides in his sister that he wants to transition into a real female. Liam asks Regan to help him with his transitioning and, although she agrees, she finds herself worried about Liam and his safety. The novel follows Regan as she makes sense of her bother’s decision, replaying memories of moments where Liam ‘let Luna out’ and fearing the worst for Liam’s transitioning. Other problems arise for Regan as she is attending high school. She spends most of her life avoiding other students, in fear of letting the secret slip. But a new boy at school, Chris, becomes interested in her. Although Regan enjoys attention from Chris, she draws away from him, choosing to stay focused on Luna. As Luna is coming out more, her father starts to notice differences in his son and tries to push a more masculine role onto Liam. Regan’s father confides in her that he believes Liam is homosexual. Meanwhile, their mother remains oblivious to the rising tension in the household. Consumed by the workload of her wedding planning business, the mother is constantly out of the house and distant from her family. Despite the tensions and the negativity weighing on her choice, Luna fights for her right to be the person she feels that she was meant to be. Alongside her, Regan learns to stand her ground, to think more of herself, and discovers the person she wants to be.
