Tanis Half-Elven now permanently resides in Solace years after his first meeting with Flint Fireforge in Qualinost. A newcomer, the kender, Tasslehoff Burrfoot arrives in Solace and befriends both Tanis and Flint (much to the dwarf's chagrin), after accidentally 'borrowing' a magical bracelet that the dwarf had just made. As the kender leaves town, he again somehow acquires the bracelet and offers it to a tinker, Gaesil, to return it to the dwarf. However the tinker is shortly thereafter fleeced by a con-artist named Delbridge, who claims the magical bracelet for himself. A Dargonesti elf, named Princess Selana locates Flint, Tanis and Tas (who has returned to Solace) and requests the magical bracelet that she had the dwarf create for her. Flint tells that the bracelet has been lost and the four journey to Tantallon, after hearing a rumour of the prophet Delbridge who can see the future through use of a magical bracelet. They arrive in Tantallon to find that Delbridge is now a zombie and that the local lord's son, Rostrevor Curston, has disappeared. Lord Curston's wizard friend Balcombe, now has the bracelet after executing Delbridge. Balcombe has kidnapped Rostrevor, to sacrifice to the evil God Hiddukel to end their bargain that they had made at the beginning of the novel where Hiddukel agrees to spare Balcombe's life in exchanged for pure souls. As the party attempt to reclaim the bracelet, Selana is kidnapped and placed in a cave with Balcome's pet giant, Blu. The sea elf and giant become friends and plan to escape. Tanis, Flint and Tas encounter a group of phaethons and ally with them to drive out Balcombe from their mountain range. The phaethons and their friends infiltrate Balcombe's lair, and with the aid of the giant Blu, rescue Rostrevor and Selana, and trap Balcombe in a magical gem. Tas unwittingly uses the magical gem and sacrifices Balcombe's soul to Hiddukel.
