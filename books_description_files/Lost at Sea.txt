Raleigh is on board a road trip from California, where she was visiting her father and her boyfriend Stillman, back home to Vancouver with her fellow high school students Stephanie, Dave, and Ian, whom she meets by accident after missing her train. During the trip, she muses on her relationship with Stillman, whom she met over the Internet, as well as her belief that she has no friends due to her belief that when she was 14 her mother sold it to Satan in exchange for career success, who then placed it in the body of a cat. Augmenting her palpable existential confusion is the bizarre emergence of a series of cats, seeming to follow Raleigh through her journey. In her confusion and curiosity, Raleigh, with the help of her new friends, attempts to catch one of the cats, believing it to be in possession of her soul. The task acts as a bonding activity for the students, and a catalyst in revealing insight into each others character.
