Speaking on "Rethinking Green", Brand provided a short version of his book: The book challenges traditional environmentalist thinking around four major issues: *Cities are green. *Nuclear power is green. *Genetic engineering is green. *Geoengineering is probably necessary. And he summarized the book. Urbanization, or the move to cities, requires grid electricity, which one chapter discusses, in particular nuclear power. Another two chapters explain the need for genetic engineering. A "sermon" on science and large-scale geoengineering is a fourth chapter. Fifth is a chapter on restoration of natural infrastructure and benevolent ecosystem engineering. Finally, Brand concludes with humans' obligation to "learn planet craft", to enhance life and Earth like an earthworm.
