Anna is ecstatic when her parents announce to her that they are having a baby. She sees this as her opportunity to show that she is grown-up and can take care of the family. But Ben's birth is overshadowed by the fact that he is born with hydrocephalus. At first, it is very hard for Anna to cope with this new situation, but she really loves Ben and does her very best to take care of him. At school she has problems explaining to people what is wrong with her brother, because she thinks that they will not understand and she doesn't want their sympathy. Soon after Ben 'meets' Anna's school-mate, Miranda, for the first time, the word of him being disabled quickly spreads to the rest of Anna's classmates. Anna gets angry, but then breaks down, and all her friends feel sympathetic toward her. She then says how Ben really is and invites her friends to meet him: it turns out they love him as well. The book focuses mainly on the difficulty faced by Anna and her family in dealing with Ben's disability and later coming to terms with losing him and trying to move on with their lives.
