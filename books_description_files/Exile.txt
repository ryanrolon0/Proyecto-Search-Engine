Jacen Solo increases in popularity with each victory over the Corellian rebels. He attempts to advance his goal of galactic peace in the midst of war. Most of his family opposes Jacen's new attempts, as they fear that the war is being exploited by a mysterious power for personal gain. Luke Skywalker experiences Force visions leading him to believe the entity in question is Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith, but Jacen himself shows ever-increasing signs of trouble. The Corellians set a trap for the Alliance, by sending out a false trail by claiming that they are hosting a secret election to choose a leader. The Alliance falls for it by planning an attack at the election and their fleet gets trapped in a mine field. Jacen Solo also gets trapped on the gas planet the fake election was being held and his family and Lumiya help him to escape. Luke and Lumiya shake hands without attacking each other. All of the main characters survive. Another conspiracy leads Luke's son Ben to Ziost, a Sith homeworld. It is filled with many dangers, the largest being the sheer amount of dark side power that would rattle even the strongest Jedi. His journey on Ziost leads Ben to find a Sith Meditation Sphere, which he uses to escape the planet.
