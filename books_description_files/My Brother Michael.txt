Camilla Haven has recently broken her engagement to Philip and is holidaying on her own in Greece. She is sitting in a cafe in Athens writing to Elizabeth, who would have been with Camilla but for a broken leg, when a man appears with a message about a hired car for Delphi. Camilla hasn't requested it, but no one else claims the car. She wants to visit Delphi, but was doubtful about being able to afford it. She's told that it is a matter of "life and death" and that the deposit has been paid. So, after leaving her hotel address with the café's proprietor, she drives the car to Delphi herself. On the way she meets Simon Lester. Simon is in Greece to learn more about the death of his brother Michael during the Second World War.
