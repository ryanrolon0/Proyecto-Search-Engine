The story takes place on a farm in Georgia, just after World War II in the 1940s. The owner of the farm, Mrs. McIntyre, contacts a Catholic priest to find her a "displaced person" to work as a farm hand. The priest finds a Polish refugee named Mr. Guizac who relocates with his family to the farm. Because the displaced person is quite industrious, the Shortlys, a family of white farm hands, feel threatened and try to manipulate Mrs. McIntyre into firing Guizac, but Mrs. McIntyre decides to fire Shortly instead because of his perceived laziness. After the Shortlys leave, Mrs. McIntre misses Mrs. Shortly but finds out she died of a stroke on the day that they left, so she invites Mr. Shortly back instead. When she finds out that Guizac is asking his teenage niece to come to America by marrying one of the African American farm hands, she is appalled and when she eventually goes to fire him, a tractor rolls over his body.
