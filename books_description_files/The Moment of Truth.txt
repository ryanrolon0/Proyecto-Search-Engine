To fulfill their duties to the Republic, a Jedi must remain focused, and not be distracted by personal conflicts. The tense Master-Padawan relationship between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker puts this resolve to the test. The normally headstrong Anakin is plagued by feelings of doubt and guilt for not preventing the death of a Jedi Council member. Obi-Wan has his reservations, seeing himself as a less-than-perfect mentor to a less-than-perfect student. The two must put aside their conflicts if they are to undertake a daring rescue mission to the last free planet of the Uziel system. Their lives, and an entire planet, depend on it.
