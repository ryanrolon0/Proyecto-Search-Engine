The narrative unfolds through the eyes of a wooden doll named Hitty. Hitty was carved in the early 19th century for a young girl from Maine. The story details Hitty's adventures as she travels from owner to owner over the course of a century. She ends up living in locations as far-flung as Boston, New Orleans, India, and an island in the South Pacific. At various times, she is lost deep under the sea and also under sofa cushions, abandoned in a hayloft, and serves as part of a snake-charmer's act. The story was inspired by a doll purchased by Field. The doll currently resides at the Stockbridge Library Association in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
