A cat named "Pufftail" (he says that he truly has no name) tells his life story to his daughter Tabitha and his grandson. He tells of his life on the streets, in a pet shop, at a convent, with a kind grandmother, and with the cruel "June and Jim," among others and says that he has three tragic parts in his life. In chronological order, the most important events of Pufftail's life are: # Being born # Separated from his mum with his brother # Being taken to a pet shop # Being taken in by Grandma Harris, until she dies # Being taken in by June and Jim Harbottle # The death of his brother # Being taken in by a convent of nuns # Joining the gang called "The Commune" # Being used to test a shampoo # Meeting his "wife" # The birth of his children # The death of his "wife" # Meeting his daughter, Tabitha # The birth of his grandchildren
