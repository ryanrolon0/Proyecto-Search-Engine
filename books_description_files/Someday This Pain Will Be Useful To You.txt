James Sveck is an isolated young adult caught in the summer before he is to begin college at Brown University. The only person in his life with whom he is able to successfully relate is his grandmother; otherwise, James prefers solitude. Cameron’s use of first person narration allows for the reader to create an intimate relationship with James as he works through his life and through the therapy sessions to which his parents have made him go. The reader learns about James’s present as he tells the events of his days, but the reader learns about his past when James’s reflects on his therapy sessions. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 play a key role in James' outlook and emotional state.
