The story is set in rural Norway. The main character is a wild tempered young boy "Hans Trefothaugen", who gets involved in fights and a stabbing, and ends up as an outlaw living in the forests. While enjoying the independent way of life in the wilderness, he is also desperately longing for the woman "Ingrid Ødden", whom he knew from their childhood, and who later has married. After various conflicts with the village people Hans eventually ends up being caught and brought to prison. The legend about the Hedal Church is embedded in the story. During the Black Death, in the middle of the 14th century, the valley Hedal was depopulated, and the valley became a wilderness. A hunter, an outlaw living and hiding in the forest, one day shot an arrow after a capercaillie, but missed and instead struck the church bell, after which the hunter discovered the old church. Entering the church, there was bear at the altar, and the hunter shot and skinned the bear. The hunter subsequently settled at a deserted farm south of the church. The gathering Hedalsmessa, held at Michaelmas, is a central event in the novel.
