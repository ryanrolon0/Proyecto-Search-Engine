Dale Stewart, a character from Summer of Night, has ruined his life. A fifty-one year old college professor and writer, he left his spouse for a young co-ed and the co-ed has left him. He returns to Elm Haven, Illinois, where the events of Summer of Night took place. Dale is remembering these events as more pleasant than what actually happened. He will soon recall the truth and also must deal with current-day Neo-Nazis.
