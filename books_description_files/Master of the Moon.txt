Diana Londen, werewolf, works as the city manger of a small South Carolina town, while moonlighting for the Verdaville Police Department as a police dog. While helping investigate a brutal murder, Diana learns she's not the only magical creature in town. A female vampire has decided to make Verdaville her murderous playground. But Diana is not the only one after the vampire. Llyr Galatyn is the king of the Cachamwri Sidhe--an other-worldly warrior with fantastic abilities. He has sworn to take down the murderous vampire and he's willing to give Diana any help she needs. And not just with the case. Diana is in her Burning Moon, a time of sexual heat for werewolves. When needs rides her hard, Llyr is delighted to answer her erotic prayers. As they hunt for the rogue vampire, an even more deadly enemy urges the vampire to turn her sights toward Llyr. Llyr, it turns out, isn't the only king of the Sidhe-and his brother Ansgar wants him dead.
