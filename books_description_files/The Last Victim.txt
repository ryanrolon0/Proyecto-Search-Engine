In 1994, Moss was an 18-year-old college student at UNLV. While studying for his honors thesis, he established relationships with John Wayne Gacy, Richard Ramirez, Henry Lee Lucas, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Charles Manson. He obtained samples of correspondence from and interviews with these men. Moss researched what would interest his subject the most and then cast himself in the role of disciple, admirer, surrogate, or potential victim. In his book he mentioned that he was interested in a career with the FBI; he reasoned that gaining the trust of a serial killer, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate. Moss forged the strongest relationship with Gacy; letters led to regular Sunday morning phone calls, during which Gacy trumpeted his innocence even as he gave Moss a guided tour of his world. In the book, Moss tells the story of his correspondence and eventual meeting with Gacy shortly before Gacy was executed. According to the viewpoint informing the title of this book, Moss became Gacy's "last victim" after a face to face meeting in prison, in essence being overpowered by a manipulative, depraved sociopath. Moss felt that this misadventure allowed him to understand how a killer's mind works in not only controlling the vulnerable but also in terms of how to break them. Jason Moss committed suicide in June 2006
