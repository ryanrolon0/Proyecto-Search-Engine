Eugenides, the one-handed former Thief of Eddis, has married the Queen of Attolia, bringing peace to the two countries and becoming King. But what kind of a king is he? He slouches on his throne, appears to sleep during important briefings, makes snide remarks, wears ridiculous clothes, and refuses to be more than a figurehead, letting the Queen rule as she has always done. The Attolian court resents him as a foreigner, an upstart, and an ineffectual fool. The story is told largely from the point of view of Costis, a young soldier in the Queen's Guard. When the King insults Teleus, captain of the Guard, Costis loses control and knocks the King down. He expects to be executed, but the King spares his life and makes him his reluctant confidant. Costis finds the King maddening, obnoxious, and conniving, but slowly he begins to have some sympathy for Eugenides – a very young man, far from his mountain home in Eddis, married to the beautiful but ruthless Queen. The plot twists and turns through an assassination attempt and various political intrigues involving the traitorous Baron Erondites and his sons; Relius, the Queen’s master of spies; and Eugenides's old enemy, Nahuseresh of the Mede Empire. Costis begins to realize that there is much more to the King than meets the eye. He gains a clearer understanding of the King's abilities, motives, and complex relationship with the Queen. With this knowledge, Costis finds his own life and reputation at risk. Surprising revelations continue throughout the book, as the fate of three nations hinges on Eugenides's internal struggle to accept his own destiny and truly be the King of Attolia.
