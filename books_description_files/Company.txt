The setting for the novel is Seattle, at a company called Zephyr Holdings, although from the building it is difficult to discern the company's type of business. Apparently a defining characteristic of the company is its obscurity. In fact, in the novel no one has ever met the CEO. When Stephen Jones, a young recruit, reports for his first day in the Training Sales Department shortly after there has been a theft. Stephen is promoted from assistant to acting sales representative. However, Stephen believes the company is hiding something—something that would explain why people who are fired seem to disappear. And, he wonders, what exactly is the Omega Management System?
