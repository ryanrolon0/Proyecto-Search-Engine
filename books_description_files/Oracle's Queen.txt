More and more people flock to Tamír's cause as they find out that she is Skala's promised Queen and that only by putting her on the throne will everything be alright once more. Tamír is much loved by the people and very popular, but she faces problems of her own. Ki, whom she loves, does not feel physical love in return, while Brother is back with more power than ever, introducing himself with only this line: "The dead do not rest until they have had vengeance." With every day that the two opposing could-be-future monarchs of Skala (Korin and Tamír), the soldiers become more and more restless, itching for a fight. However, Tamír doesn't want to fight her beloved cousin and tries to delay the battle as much as she can.
