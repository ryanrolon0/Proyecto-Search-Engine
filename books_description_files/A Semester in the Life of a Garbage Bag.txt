The plot of the novel revolves around Jardine bringing Sean Delancey, his English poetry project partner, into various schemes to ensure their arrival at Theamelpos for the summer. Along the way they encounter Ashley, a beautiful model who becomes the third member of their poetry project, and Cementhead (Steve Semenski), the luckiest student in the school, and help Sean's grandfather impersonate an 88-year-old deceased Canadian poet, Gavin Gunhold. A sub-plot revolves around SACGEN (Solar Air Current GENerator), a government project that is supposed to power the school, using only wind power and solar energy. The school's central core was gutted to house the control room and the storage batteries. Since the project works poorly or not at all, causing frequent blackouts, the students refer to it as "The Windmill."
