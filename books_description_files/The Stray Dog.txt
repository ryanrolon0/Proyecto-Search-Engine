A family of four meets a stray dog while having a picnic in the park. The two kids name the dog Willy and ask their parents if they can keep him. Unfortunately, their parents say no. During the next week, every member of the family keeps on thinking about Willy. When Saturday comes, they decide to go on another picnic to see if the stray dog will appear again. When they see a dogcatcher chase after the dog, they try to save him. When they catch up to him, the dogcatcher says that the dog doesn't belong to anyone. The kids tell him that the dog does belong to them by saying that the boy's belt was the dog's collar and the girl's hair ribbon was his leash. The dogcatcher is satisfied and leaves.
