Her notorious column addresses the dating dilemmas all coeds face and draws much interest. That’s what any young writer wants, right? Not in this case.

She doesn’t find herself lonely, as there is plenty going on to keep her attention elsewhere. But when a “cybercrush” evolves from her countless online critics its no surprise that Chloe lets herself become engrossed with this developing relationship.
