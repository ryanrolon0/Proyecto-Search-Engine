Harry Driscoll is an editorial assistant living in New York. He works for a major publishing house but is failing to make an impression by not taking his job seriously and constantly arriving at the office late and intoxicated. He is bitter, cynical and troubled but very charming, and the only thing he (secretly) cares about is his long suffering girlfriend - Evie. But he is unable to commit, be faithful or tell her he loves her and soon his self destructive actions will send his life into a rapid descent.
