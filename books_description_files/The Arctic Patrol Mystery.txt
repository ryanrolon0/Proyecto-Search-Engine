At the beginning the Hardy boys fly to Iceland to look for a man that an insurance company that is giving him a reward. Then at a party someone attempted to kidnap Frank. A clue is a glove by a sulfur pit in Iceland. It might mean the American astronauts that came to Iceland to study the volcanoes. They take a flight on a private plane to Akureyri. The pilot is an enemy and forces a landing on a glacier. After they land on the glacier they handcuff their enemy. They are fooled by a phony police helicopter that rescues the enemy. They tried to use the radio but the pilot hid the radio crystal. They found it and made contact with the radio tower at Reykjavik. Shortly another helicopter came to pick up the Hardys. They went to Akureyri and visited a phony Rex Hallbjornsson. Shortly after they see Chet wandering in front of the hotel. He looked funny. Then they realized he was drugged! They thought some one might be upstairs looking at their stuff! They rushed upstairs. It was the pilot and his phony rescuer .Joe tried to get the pilot and the wig came off. It was the phony Rex Hallbjornsson! They got away! Chet and Tony looked went to investigate a man named Hallbjornsson that might know rex while frank and Joe went with a coast guard officer to look for Hallbjornsson in the sea. After a devastating storm they saw a small raft, maybe with a motor. They thought it might be the criminals. Over the course of a day or two, they put on disguises and acted as phony crewman for Rex Mar (the real Hallbjornson—he changed his name). When they came on deck, Musselaman was there and was fooled by the disguises until Joe slipped up by speaking English in Iceland. The boys defeat the criminals in hand-to-hand combat and have them arrested.
