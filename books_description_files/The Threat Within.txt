Obi-Wan Kenobi is almost an adult and his Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, is very proud of him. Now they have to investigate and solve an odd terrorist threat between two work-obsessed planets. Eventually, it is discovered that a new culture is rising within the planet, which has a goal of stopping the planet's excessive relationship with work. The mission, while somewhat routine, sees Obi-Wan acting independently during several scenes. When a major building is nearly destroyed, Obi-Wan acts calmly, which impresses his master. Despite working somewhat separately on this mission, the master and apprentice find themselves closer.
