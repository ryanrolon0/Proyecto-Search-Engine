A normal girl in Michigan, Zoe Elias has dreams of becoming a pianist just like Vladimir Horowitz. Zoe's mom is obsessed with her work and her dad doesn't have a job, and doesn't like to interact with others. When her father brings home a Perfectone D60 Organ, Zoe is upset because she was hoping for a baby grand piano. The organ comes with free lessons and her teacher is Miss Person. After a lesson, Zoe disobeys Miss Person and instead of practicing with her tempo, she uses Ramba version. Miss Person realizes that Zoe has talent and decides that Zoe should enter the Perform-O-Rama. Zoe's mom misses her birthday and Zoe is very upset. After things go wrong, and her mother can no longer drive her to the Perform-O-Rama on the following day, she thinks that she won't make it to Perform-O-Rama. She takes out her anger on her dad, and Mr. Elias decides to take Zoe to the Perform-O-Rama, knowing she really wants to do it. Her first performance, at the Perform-O-Rama, doesn't go as well as she'd wanted. But during her second, she looks up in the audience and sees her mom, by her dad. Zoe gets motivated and later comes home with a 4th place trophy.
