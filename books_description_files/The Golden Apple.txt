In the U.S. state of Washington, near Mt. Olympus, at the turn of the 20th century, the small town of Angel’s Roost is thrown into confusion when old Menelaus's fancy-free wife, Helen, runs off with a traveling salesman named Paris. He's in town to judge an apple pie bake-off. Ulysses, just returned from the Spanish-American War, is already restless and goes to retrieve Helen, leaving his wife Penelope for a ten-year adventure.
