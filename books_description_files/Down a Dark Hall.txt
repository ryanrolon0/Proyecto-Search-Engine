After her mother gets re-married, Kit is forced to attend Madame Duret's Blackwood Boarding School. Kit originally planned to attend with her best friend, Tracy, but Tracy wasn't accepted despite having better grades. The place is far out in the country and upon glimpsing the restored ancient building, Kit feels something dark emanating from the school. She is further disturbed to find that her room only locks from the outside. The faculty consists of Madame Duret, Professor Farley, and Jules, Madame Duret's son who teaches piano. Blackwood students are taught individually, according to their 'level of learning and ability'. There are only three other students: Lynda, her best friend Ruth, and Sandy, each with a unique gift. Lynda excels at painting; Ruth, at math, and Sandy writes poetry, which none had shown any talent for before. Kit's specialty is the piano. Kit learns that Madams Duret is using the students to connect telepathically with famous artists who died young and channel their talents to create masterpieces for her. She also learns that all former students at Blackwood either lost their lives, or lost their minds. Kit devises a plan for escape and attempts to contact her friend, Tracy, for help.
