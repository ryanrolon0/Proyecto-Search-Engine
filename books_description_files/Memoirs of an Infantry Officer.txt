Sassoon's account of his experiences in the trenches during World War I, between the spring of 1916 and the summer of 1917, creates a picture of a physically brave but self-effacing and highly insecure individual. The narrative moves from the trenches to the Fourth Army School, to Morlancourt and a raid, then to and through the Somme. The narrator, George Sherston, is wounded when a bullet passes through his lung after he incautiously sticks his head over the parapet at the battle of Arras in 1917. He is sent home to convalesce, and while there arranges to have lunch with the editor of an anti-war newspaper, the Unconservative Weekly. He determines to speak out against the war, though this contravenes military regulations and could result in his execution. The book finishes as George Sherston prepares to attend 'Slateford War Hospital' (Craiglockhart War Hospital, Edinburgh) after a medical board had decided he was suffering from shell-shock.http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0571203183
