As the League fights to prevent Remor incursions, Juliana Tindale and Kurt Ellicot join a group going to Chugen IV to study a newfound alien race, the Chugeni. Through a faked attack on the landing party, their shuttle crashes and the survivors move in with the natives to survive and await rescue. When they discover the attack was a hoax, they work to save the natives by proving that they are not the Remor.
