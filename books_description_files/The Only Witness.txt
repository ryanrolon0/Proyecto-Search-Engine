A witness asks for escort and protection from the Jedi Order. She wants to testify against her family - the Cobral group - who control the planet of Frego much like the Syndicat controlled Phindar. An older Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, have to protect her, but they suspect that she is hiding something. The Cobral family stop at nothing to ensure that the witness does not testify, but they eventually fail. She is escorted to Coruscant, where she successfully testifies.
