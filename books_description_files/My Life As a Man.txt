The work is split into two sections: the first section, "Useful Fictions," consisting of two short stories about a character named Nathan Zuckerman (although this character frequently featured in Roth's later novels, scholarship has revealed this not to be the same character), and the second section, "My True Story," which takes the form of a first-person memoir by Peter Tarnopol, a Jewish writer who authored the two stories in the first section.
