Taken from the book's blurb, "Life on the Scilly Isles in 1907 is bleak and full of hardship. Laura's twin brother, Billy, disappears, and then a storm devastates everything. It seems there's little hope... that is until the Zanzibar is wrecked on the island's rocks and everything changes." The book is presented as a diary written by a young girl on a small island off the coast of Cornwall, where the Atlantic meets the English Channel. The area is subjected to severe storms, one of which destroys the island's buildings and kills the livestock; many families are left hungry and plan to leave the island. However, the residents rescue the crew of the ship Zanzibar when it runs aground, and this is the catalyst that brings new life to the island. A major subplot is the sea turtle that the girl (Laura) nurses back to health and returns to the sea.In the end Michael closes the diary and is sad but,he decides to tell everybody about the diary(The Wreck Of The Zanzibar) and in the end the girl says to Zanzibar "Come on Marzipan" and Michael says "His name is Zanzibar" and she says "That is what I said". simple:The Wreck of the Zanzibar
