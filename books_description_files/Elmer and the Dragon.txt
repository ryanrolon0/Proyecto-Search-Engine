Elmer and Boris the dragon are stranded on a remote island inhabited only by canaries. One of them, Flute, was Elmer's pet until he escaped to Canary Island. Elmer helps Flute and the king and queen canaries to dig up a chest that the island's former human settlers left. Inside are various household items, a watch, a harmonica, and six bags of gold. The dragon flies Elmer back to his house before returning to Blueland, his own home.
