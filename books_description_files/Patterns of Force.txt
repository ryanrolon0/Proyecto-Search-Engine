One of the leading Star Wars cover illustrators is Cliff Nielson, having illustrated the Jedi Apprentice series covers and several of the 20 New Jedi Order titles. It is to be a mass market paperback. There is not very many details on the book since it is coming out almost three years (or more than that) after the other Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith follow-ups like Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader and the prequel Labyrinth of Evil. It is to deal with characters from the Medstar Duology. It is supposedly the last in a series of three books by Michael Reaves, author of bestselling Star Wars: Clone Wars novels with Steve Perry. It will be preceded by two books that will have reappearing characters from the Medstar Duology, told within the timeline of the Star Wars: Clone Wars series.
