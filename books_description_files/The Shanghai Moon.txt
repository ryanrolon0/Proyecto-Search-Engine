Another PI friend of Lydia's, Joel Pillarsky, hired her to help him find a number of antique gems, including potentially a brooch, the Shanghai Moon, which has become the stuff of legend. When Lydia finds this out, however, there has been a murder, she is fired from the case, and Bill Smith reappears, claiming to have heard of the gem while in the Navy.
