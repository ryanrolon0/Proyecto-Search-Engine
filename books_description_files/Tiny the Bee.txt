Tiny the Bee is about a young bee who is forced to face the perils that accompany tolerance, friendship, patience, kindness, and hopelessness, to name a few. As he travels through his journey, he meets new and interesting characters who force him to face different aspects of acceptance. It is through these encounters that Tiny learns to accept who he is and truly soar above and beyond expectations. Because of the size of his wings, Tiny is, at first, shunned by his friends. After being unable to continue on his expected journey, Tiny decides to find his own path in life. He travels for many days, after which, he meets new friends, who accept him for exactly who he is inside; the size of his wings are no matter. Tiny learns from them true friendship and, unbeknownst to him, grows from this knowledge. He is finally able to return home to realize his dreams.
