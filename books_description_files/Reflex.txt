Since the conclusion of Jumper, David Rice, a young man with the ability to teleport, has married Millie and occasionally works for the National Security Agency, only accepting jobs that he finds to be morally acceptable. During a meeting with Brian Cox, his handler, Brian is killed and David is kidnapped by a powerful criminal organization with influence over the NSA and other government agencies. Millie discovers that she, too, has the ability to "jump", and sets out to find and rescue David with help from members of the NSA and, later, the FBI. The novel tells the story from David's and Millie's perspectives in alternating chapters.
