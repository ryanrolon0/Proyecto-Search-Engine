When an ancient English church is moved to a new site, one stone – a strange statue, the Grinnygog of the title – is found to be missing. Its accidental rediscovery (by a woman who, not realising its significance, gives it to her elderly father as a pseudo garden gnome) coincides with the arrival in the same town of three eccentric old women who seem to be looking for something lost or hidden many years before, and a nervous, "other-worldly" child. The townsfolk find themselves looking into their collective past but it takes a group of children to put the pieces of the puzzle together and make amends for an ancient injustice. The story is notable in modern popular culture for its portrayal of witches as something other than evil old hags.
