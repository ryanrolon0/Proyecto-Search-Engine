Steph Landry has been the target of jokes since sixth grade when she spilled a red Super Big Gulp on Lauren Moffat's white D&G skirt. In response, Lauren coined the phase "Don't be such a Steph Landry" to ensure she never lived it down. Steph has since been content to hang out with her best friends Jason and Becca, but as she enters eleventh grade, she wants more out of high school. Luckily she finds a copy of an old book titled none other than How to be Popular when cleaning out Jason's grandmother's attic. The book is full of useful tips. She follows the book's advice and begins the school year with flat ironed hair and a new attitude. Steph is determined to be confident and enthusiastic about school. She sits with new people at lunch and organizes a talent auction. Steph does not anticipate Lauren being so angry about her attempt to join the popular crowd or that Jason would be so hurt that she is leaving him behind. As her popularity grows, Steph is forced to make difficult choices about who and what is truly important to her.
