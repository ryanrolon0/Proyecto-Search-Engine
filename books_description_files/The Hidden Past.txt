Young Obi-Wan Kenobi is now the Padawan of the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. While preparing for their next mission, Obi-Wan celebrates his thirteenth birthday. Qui-Gon provides his apprentice with a special rock that has Force-sensitive powers. Meanwhile, Yoda assigns them to the planet of Gala, where they must oversee elections between Prince Beju and two other candidates. However, along the way to Gala, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are hijacked by Guerra's brother, Paxxi and forced to land on the planet of Phindar, which is controlled by The Syndicat crime organization. Although hesitant to help eradicate the Syndicat at first, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are forced to cooperate with Guerra and his friends when they realize that none other than Gala's Prince Beju is in league with the crime faction. Beju plans on using the Syndicat's power to cut bacta supply, allowing him to control Gala and, hopefully, the entire sector. At the Syndicat's headquarters, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon discover that the storages are empty, giving them a lead that Beju is indeed in on the plot. Later, Obi-Wan is captured and nearly brainwashed by the Syndicat, though he uses the Force to endure it along with the Force-sensitive rock. As a result, Obi-Wan is able to sneak aboard Beju's ship and incriminate the Syndicat organization. With the Syndicat defeated, Beju is forced to return to Gala and operate his plans alone. Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi brace themselves on their next mission.
