The book centers on Jane Whittaker, who finds herself at a grocery store in downtown Boston with no recollection of her name, her physical features, her personality, or any of the details of her life, albeit having recollection of facts such as the formula for a hypotenuse. She is further terrified to see that she is wearing a blood-stained blue dress, which contains in one of its pockets $10,000. Frightened out of her mind, she heads to a local police station, where she is later reunited with a handsome doctor claiming to be her husband. Mr. Whittaker takes Jane back to their suburban home to recover. Instead of finding rest, however, Jane begins to uncover the horrific past that her mind had forgotten. Along with Dr. Whittaker, a caretaker named Paula Marinelli is also taking care of her.
