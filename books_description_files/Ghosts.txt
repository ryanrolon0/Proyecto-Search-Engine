Ghosts takes place in an unfinished luxury apartment complex in Buenos Aires that is shared by a family of squatters and a cadre of ghosts that haunt its floors. While most of the construction workers and family members react to the ghosts with detachment, the family's teenage daughter becomes fixated on the specters. As the story weaves away and back again towards the date set for the opening of the apartment complex, the daughter's obsession with the ghosts becomes more complex and nefarious, and ultimately threatens her life.
