The plot is set in the 1960s, which chronicles the awakening of the hippie stoner Divine Right (Davenport) as he travels with his patient and introspective VW Bus, Urge. Initially, he travels with his 'lady' Estelle and they meet up with characters such as 'The Lone Outdoorsman' (a curiously warm hearted right-wing reactionary character) and 'The Greek'. Eventually, Divine Right finds himself travelling alone back to his Appalachian roots.
