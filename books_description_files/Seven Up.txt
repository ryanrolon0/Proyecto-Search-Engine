Stephanie is assigned to bring in semi-retired mobster Eddie DeChooch when he fails to appear in court for selling contraband cigarettes. When two of Stephanie's burned-out high-school friends, Walter 'MoonMan' Dunphy and Dougie 'The Dealer' Kruper, get themselves mixed up in DeChooch's cigarette scheme -- and then vanish -- Stephanie calls the mysterious Ranger for help. With Ranger's assistance, plus the 'aid' of two (very polite) hoodlums with a talent for breaking-and-entering, it becomes apparent that DeChooch may have come out of retirement... To make things worse, Stephanie's perfect older sister Valerie divorces her cheating husband, and moves back in with her family, along with her two daughters. She then proclaims herself to be a lesbian, and adds more craziness to Stephanie's life. In short, life in the Burg hasn't changed a bit.
