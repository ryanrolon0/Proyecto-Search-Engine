The book includes summaries of the life and work of amongst many others, 18th century scientists Jagdish Chandra Bose and George Washington Carver as well as Corentin Louis Kervran. The book also discusses alternative philosophy and practice on soil and soil health, as well as on alternative farming methods. Such topics as auras, psychophysics, orgone energy, radionics, kirlian photography, magnetotropism, bio-electrics and dowsing are also discussed. One of the book's claims is that plants may be sentient despite their lack of a nervous system and a brain. The book includes unscientific experiments on plant stimuli, as through a polygraph, a method which was pioneered by Cleve Backster. The book is regarded as pseudoscientific by skeptics and many scientists.
