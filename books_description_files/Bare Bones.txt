In the Charlotte summer heat, Dr Brennan has to identify a newborn skeleton in a wood stove that was probably born to the daughter of an acquaintance of her. Victims of a sports plane crash may be drug runners. And mixed animal-human bones in a derelict outhouse are a mystery discovered by her ex-husband's dog, Boyd. More puzzling, the drug runners and the animal (mostly bear) bones seem to be connected in a blatant CITES violation - the market for CITES animals and parts thereof being as hot as the drug market.
