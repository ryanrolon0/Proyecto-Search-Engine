Set in West Palm Beach and Miami, FL, Rum Punch follows Jackie Burke, a 44-year-old airline stewardess, who has been bringing cash into the country for a gunrunner named Ordell Robbie (whose nickname, Whitebread, comes from the fact that he's a light-skinned African-American). When the cops try to use Jackie to get at Ordell, she hatches a plan—with help from bail bondsman Max Cherry—to keep the money for herself.
