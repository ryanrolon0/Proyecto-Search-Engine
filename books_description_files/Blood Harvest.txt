While the Seventh Doctor and Ace team up with a hard bitten PI in 1929 Chicago, Bernice is stranded on a vampire-infested world with the Doctor's former companion Romana. The chief monster is a supernaturally powerful creature called Agonal, an elemental who feeds on agony and death and so seeks as much of such as he can. Rassilon traps Agonal in his tomb, just as he trapped Borusa in the television story, "The Five Doctors."
