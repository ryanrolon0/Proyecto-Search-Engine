The Go-Giver as the authors tell, revolves around the story of a young professional (Joe) who is striving for success. Joe is ambitious, however lately it seems like his hard work and efforts are not paying off in terms of results. Following a disappointing quarter - in terms of sales results - he inadvertently seeks the mentorship of The Chairman. Joe then embarks on a learning journey by meeting Go-Givers - friends of The Chairman. Through these interactions he learns of the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success: 1- The Law of Value: Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment. 2- The Law of Compensation: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them. 3- The Law of Influence: Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first. 4- The Law of Authenticity: The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself. 5- The Law of Receptivity: The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.
