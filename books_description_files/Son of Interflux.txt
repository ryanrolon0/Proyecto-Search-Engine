Simon Irving has just moved to the town of Greenbush, New York with his parents. His father is the Senior Vice President of Interflux, a large corporation that makes only parts of things. He enters into Nassau County High School for Visual, Literary and Performing Arts, an arts school, in an attempt to become a painter and therefore avoid the business job that his father has planned for him. When he finds out that a major expansion is in the works and that the schools greenspace (a small wood and stream) will have be cut down to make way, Simon finds a way to get back at Interflux. He uses Student Council funds to purchase a crazily shaped strip of land that Interflux is not aware of and therefore does not own. Inventing the rival group "Antiflux", he convinces most of the schools 1500 students to go along with him. By blockading the land, Antiflux causes the expansion to grind to a halt. On top of this, Simon has to keep his grades up and keep the student body from finding out that he is the Son of Interflux.
