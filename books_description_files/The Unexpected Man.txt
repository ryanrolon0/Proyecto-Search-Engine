A man and a woman sit opposite each other in the detached intimacy of a train compartment on a journey from Paris to Frankfurt. He is a world famous author, she carries his latest novel in her bag and ponders the dilemma of reading it in front of him.... As both the woman and man ponder their situation in the compartment they bring past events and philosophies up in separate monologues. Finally in the ending of the play, they speak conversationally, and in the last line of the show the woman calls the author by his name, the one thing she was so afraid to find out, if he was like how she envisioned.
