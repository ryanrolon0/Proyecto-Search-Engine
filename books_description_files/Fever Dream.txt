Special Agent Pendergast teams up with Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta to reveal the mystery surrounding his wife's murder. The wife was after a painting that turned out to be highly relevant to a neurological disease. With the help of her brother, she recruited a team of pharmaceuticals to study this disease, but when the secret project began to cut corners, she tried to back out. She was then killed for trying to expose the project to the general public. Pendergast tracks down most of the members involved.
