The use of the weapon in the first book has led to storms that sweep the planet and make travel by sea nearly impossible. A group of magicians thinks it has the way to stop the storms: Dragonwall, a device that will drain the storms' energy. But when Dragonwall's true purpose is discovered, it's up to the priestess to destroy it by any means necessary. Meanwhile, the world has a new vampire, looked after by the old one and an unlikely genius who travels with a fallen courtier. All of them, plus a motley crew of soldiers and a sorceress (who wants nothing more than good food and pleasant company) must help the priestess destroy Dragonwall before it's too late.
