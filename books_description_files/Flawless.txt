In continuation from the "Pretty Little Liars" series Hanna, Aria, Spencer, and Emily continue to receive text messages from an unknown person, "A", who threatens to expose them of their secrets. At first the girls think "A" is Alison because she is the only person who knew their secrets, but then they start to believe the person behind the threats is Toby, because some messages they receive refer to 'The Jenna Thing' and with Alison dead, he is the only other person who was a part of the incident, although everyone but Spencer is unaware of why he took the blame for what happened to Jenna. "A" sends Emily a text message hinting that "A" knows about Emily and Maya's romantic relationship. "A" leaves a note for Hanna that forces her to tell Riley and Naomi that she makes herself throw up, and that Sean was the one who broke up with her. Later on, she receives a text that tells her Sean is at Foxy ( with another girl. When she arrives, she finds Sean and Aria together. "A" continuously tells Aria to either 'get rid of the problem' or to tell her mom the truth about Byron, her father, that he is seeing another woman. Spencer's sister, Melissa, finds out Spencer has been secretly dating her ex-boyfriend, Wren, by someone who Spencer believes was "A". Towards the end of the book, Hanna finds out that it's impossible for Toby to be "A" because he is found dead behind Emily's house. Emily reads a note Toby left for her that tells the truth about 'The Jenna Thing', which previously Emily thought Toby was referring to Alison when she told him "I know what you did to her." Spencer tells the other girls the truth: Toby molested his stepsister and promised to keep a secret for Alison if she did the same for him. But thinking Emily knew the truth, he committed suicide as, mentioned in the note "he couldn't live with the mistake he has made."
