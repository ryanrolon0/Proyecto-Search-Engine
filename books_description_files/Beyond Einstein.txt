Beyond Einstein is a book that tries to explain the basics of superstring theory. Michio Kaku analyzes the history of theoretical physics and the struggle to unite a unified field theory. He explained that the superstring theory might be the only theory that can unite quantum mechanics and general relativity in one theory. This book avoids complex mathematics and it is useful for both professional physicists and general readers who have more than a passing curiosity in physics.
