The story deals with a father that takes his daughter owling for the first time on a cold winter's night. Along their way, they encounter a Great Horned Owl. While it is not stated which gender the child is, Schoenherr's illustrations gave it away. According to Jane Yolen's website, the daughter is actually Yolen's child, Heidi Stemple. The "Pa" character is based on her husband, an avid outdoorsman and birdwatcher.
