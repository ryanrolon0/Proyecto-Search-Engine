Belle Terre is a new human colony set up on a vitally strategic new planet. It is to be a much-needed stop-over point for human expansion. Unfortunately there is months of distance between this section of space and the Federation, the exact reason for the colony in the first place. The Enterprise and James Kirk have been dealing with a series of threats to Belle Terre, the latest is an alien race armed with a 'superweapon' that is determined to kill every last human; the mineral rights are just too valuable.
