Isabel Allende wrote Paula while tending to her daughter Paula Frías Allende who was in a coma arising from complications of the disease porphyria. Allende started the book as a letter to Paula, explaining what she was missing so she would not be confused when she recovered. The novel includes both an account of Paula's treatment and Allende's life, sometimes overlapping the content of first novel The House of the Spirits. Paula died on December 6, 1992, survived by her husband Ernesto and other family members.
