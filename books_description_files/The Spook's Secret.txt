In this third and terrifying instalment in the Wardstone Chronicles, the nights are drawing in and it is time for Tom and his master to move to Anglezarke, the Spook's winter house. Tom has heard it will be a sinister and menacing place, but nothing could fully prepare him for what he finds there. For this house, and indeed the whole of Anglezarke moor is full of secrets about the Spook's youth. When they reach Anglezarke Tom and the Spook leave Alice with the Hursts, who owe the Spook a favour. They then head to the Spook's winter house. There Tom meets Meg, and finds out that the Spook has been keeping her drugged so she wouldn't harm the other inhabitants. Trouble arises at the Hursts and Tom and the Spook have to face a rock throwing spirit. They win, but barely, and the Spook is severely injured. With Alice's help, he pulls through, against all odds, but is still weak. Alice then moves back with Tom to help and undertakes the task of giving Meg her potion. She takes a liking to Meg so she decreases the dosage and to help her and Meg becomes more lively.
