The novel portrays the close friendship between two women doing artistic work, Jonna and Mari, who live in separate apartments in the same house. They are in many ways quite different, but maybe because of this they are able to complete each other. It is about give and take, compromises and communication, and how the relationship survives even if it changes when the people do. Many chapters in the book are written such that they can be read stand-alone, and a few have been republished in the short story collection A Winter Book. sv:Rent spel
