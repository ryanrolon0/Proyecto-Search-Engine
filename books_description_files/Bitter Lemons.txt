The book is alternately comic and serious, charting Durrell's experiences on Cyprus and the people he met and befriended, as well as charting the progress of the Cypriot "Enosis" (union with Greece and freedom from British rule) movement, which plunged the island into chaos and violence. Comic moments include Durrell's successful house-buying adventure, and the visits of his mother and brother, naturalist Gerald Durrell. Durrell settled in the village of Bellapais (purposely spelt "Bellapaix" by Durrell to evoke the old name Paix), which is now part of the Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus. During his stay, Durrell worked first as an English teacher at the Pancyprian Gymnasium, where several of his female students reportedly fell in love with him: Invited to write an essay on her favourite historical character, [Electra] never failed to delight me with something like this: 'I have no historical character but in the real life there is one I love. He is writer. I dote him and he dotes me. How pleasure is the moment when I see him came at the door. My glad is very big.' Eventually, however, &#34;the vagaries of fortune and the demons of ill-luck dragged Cyprus into the stock-market of world affairs&#34; and as armed groups emerged demanding an end to British rule and Cyprus&#39; reunion with Greece, Durrell accepted a job as press adviser to the British governor. Durrell was not enamoured with the Cypriot militants, however, and felt that they were dragging the island to a &#34;feast of unreason&#34; and that &#34;embedded so deeply in the medieval compost of religious hatreds, the villagers floundered in the muddy stream of undifferentiated hate like drowning men.&#34; The account ends with him fleeing the island without saying goodbye to his friends, approaching the &#34;heavily guarded airport&#34; by taxi in conversation with the driver who tells him &#34;Dighenis, though he fights the British, really loves them. But he will have to go on killing them—with regret, even with affection.&#34;
