After the events of the first book, Vision in White, where we saw photographer Mackensie Elliot fall in love, it is now up to florist Emmaline "Emma" Grant to find her perfect soulmate. Her career is getting more successful by the minute and her love life seems to be thriving. Men swarm around her, captivated by her bubbly personality and great looks, but finding "Mr. Right Guy" is never easy, especially when the last place she's looking is right under her nose. And that is exactly where architect Jack Cooke is: he has been very close to all the women of Vows for a long time, and he is one of Delaney's best friends. They have both started admitting that their feelings for each other may have developed in something more than just friendship. And when their passion starts to grow, kiss after kiss, they are only left to trust in their history and their hearts.
