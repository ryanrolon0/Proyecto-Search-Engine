Julian, Dick, Anne, George and Timmy return to Kirrin Cottage for the Christmas holidays. As a result of being off school due to illnesses, the four children have a tutor, Mr. Roland, during the holidays in order to catch up with the work they missed. One day during the holidays, the children visit Kirrin Farmhouse, and the owners allow George to show her cousins all around the farmhouse, and show them some of the old secret cubby-holes in the farmhouse. George asks Mrs Sanders if she can show her cousins the cupboard with the false back on it upstairs, but Mrs Sanders tells her she is cleaning the room as she has some guests staying with her. When searching in a hole in the wall, Dick finds a piece of paper, with instructions on it written in Latin. The four take it back to Kirrin Cottage and ask Mr. Roland what the instructions on the paper say, as he reads Latin. He tells them that it is something about a room facing east with 8 wooden panels in it, and the panel must lead to somewhere! That night, George goes downstairs to see Timmy, as he was made to sleep outside because Mr. Roland didn't like dogs. George goes into Uncle Quentin's study to get the front door key, and finds Mr. Roland standing in the study. He tells George he heard a noise and came to investigate, but George finds it very suspicious. The four children then realise that the study is a room facing east with eight stone panels on the floor, and the panel which leads to a secret place is hidden under a rug covering the floor. The children follow the tunnel and come to a cupboard, and when they open it, they find themselves in Kirrin farmhouse, in the cupboard with the false back. The two guests staying at Kirrin Farmhouse are friends with Mr. Roland, and are planning on stealing Uncle Quentin's notes on his experiments.
