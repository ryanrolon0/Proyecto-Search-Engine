Be More Chill is written in the first person, from the perspective of high school student Jeremy Heere. Jeremy is a teenage loser, who can't get with any girls and is frequently tormented by bullies, usually Rich, a short-statured, but well-built popular teen. After hearing from Rich about the "squip"--a quantum computer in pill form that can communicate directly with your brain once ingested—Jeremy purchases the pill at the back of a Payless Shoes store, and transforms from a klutzy loser to a member of the social elite.
