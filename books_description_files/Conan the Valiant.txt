Conan the Valiant is set in Turan where a 22 year old Conan is recovering from his victory over the Cult of Doom (found in Robert Jordan's Conan the Unconquered). Not surprisingly, Conan finds himself involved in court intrigue and joins forces with a sword maiden Raihna and her employer the sorcerer Illyana in an effort to both keep out of Mughra Khan's dungeon and stop the growing menace of the magic user Eremius. Using one of the Jewels of Kurag—the other is held by Illyana—Eremius has command over a growing army of the Transformed, one-time humans who are turned into reptilian demons, and is looking to conquer large parts of Turan. The combination of local villagers, Conan's sword, and Illyana's magic destroy Eremius and the twin Jewels.
