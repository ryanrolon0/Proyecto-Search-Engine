The book comprises seven interlinked stories about a young boy, Peter Fortune, whose daydreams place him into various fantastic situations: he discovers a cream that makes people vanish; transforms into a cat, a baby, a doll, and, in the last story, an adult. He is 10 years old at the start of the novel and 12 at the end.
