One day an old woman grants Alex one wish for his kindness to her. Alex uses it to wish that his little brother Stevie had never been born; to his horror, it comes true. Although no one else remembers Stevie, and Alex's life is in some ways better now, he is still guilt-stricken, and desperately tries to find a way to reverse his wish.
