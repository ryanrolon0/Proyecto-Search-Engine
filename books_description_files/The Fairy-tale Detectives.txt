Eleven year old Sabrina and seven year old Daphne are orphans that go to live with their grandmother (who they thought was dead) in the town of Ferryport Landing. After the disappearance of their parents and going through numerous foster homes, they soon find out that their grandmother is a very strange person who says that the town is filled with fairy-tale beings, also known as Everafters. Daphne believes her, Sabrina does not and wants to escape but when she and Daphne try to, they are attacked by Fireflies in the woods who are controlled by Puck. Later, their grandmother and Mr. Canis get kidnapped by a Giant that is destruction in the town. Sabrina and Daphne, alone in the woods, soon meet Puck (From A Midsummer's Night Dream), and mistake him for Peter Pan, enraging him. He agrees to help them save their grandmother since she was kind to him and fed him sometimes. They also meet the Magic Mirror that is a household item in their home. While being pursued by the police(the three little pigs). Sabrina, Daphne, and Puck escape the house on a magic carpet and fly to the Ferryport Landing jail where they rescue Jack (From Jack and the Beanstalk.) Jack forms a plan to sneak into the Mayor's Mansion and try to get information about the giant. But the giant finds them instead and wrecks the rich mayor's mansion. Sabrina (disguised as Mama Bear from Goldielocks) and Daphne (disguised as the Tinman) escape and find out that Jack tricked them. He was the one who set loose the giant hoping that by killing it in front of a crowd of news reporters he would come back into immense fame. They also discover he is part of a shady organization known as The Scarlet Hand. But just as things are looking their bleakest, he is stopped by Mr. Canis, who transforms into the Big Bad Wolf (trapped in Mr. Canis's body), and the giant is sent back to his kingdom.
