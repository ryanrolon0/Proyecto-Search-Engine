Business is slow for Stephanie Plum, so when her Uncle Fred goes missing, Stephanie agrees to help look for him. Soon enough, Stephanie realizes that (once again) she's in over her head, and up to her neck in unanswered questions. Stephanie for the first time takes a job with Ranger at his company to make ends meet. Why are there pictures of body parts in Uncle Fred's house? Why is a nasty bookie following Stephanie around? Could her Uncle's disappearance have something to do with two dollars? Why can't she bring in the certified midget FTA Randy Briggs? Stephanie's stalker Benito Ramirez, from book one, is released and is back to irritate Stephanie some more. Stephanie's latest case is proceeding 'business as usual'.
