Jo (also known as Joe in later editions), Bessie (Beth in later editions), and Fanny (Frannie in later editions) move to the country and find an Enchanted Wood right on their doorstep. In the wood stands the magic Faraway Tree, which is home to the magical characters that soon become their new friends - Moon-face, Silky the Fairy,Saucepan Man, Angry Pixie, Mister Watsizname and Dame Washalot. Together they visit the strange lands (the Roundabout Land, the Land of Ice and Snow, Toyland, the Land of Spells and the Land of Take What You Want) which lie at the top of the tree and have exciting adventures.
