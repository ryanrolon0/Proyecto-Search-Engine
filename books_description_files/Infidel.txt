Stretched to their limits and celebrated as heroes, the chosen will wish they had never been given that thankless task of finding the seven lost Books of History before the Dark One can. Martyn, a new Horde general, emerges and lures Johnis into the Horde city, Thrall, to force him into betraying Thomas. Once there, the chosen four are all caught by the Horde and Johnis is forced to strand Thomas into the desert to die. In the end, Johnis, Silvie, Billos, and Darsal are able to save Johnis' mother, retrieve three of the Lost books of History, and recruit the Dark Priest of Teelah's daughter into becoming a member of the forest.
