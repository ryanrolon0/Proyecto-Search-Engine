Early one May, sixth-grader Rod Allbright is launched into the adventure of a lifetime when a tiny alien spaceship (the good ship Ferkel of the Galactic Patrol) crashes in his room, changing his life forever. Now, Rod finds himself aiding the aliens on their mission: to capture BKR (pronounced Bee-Kay-Are), an interstellar criminal whose mission in life is to cause as much pain and misery as he can. Ultimately, Rod is able to help the crew of the Ferkel in returning to their normal sizes, and defeating BKR.
