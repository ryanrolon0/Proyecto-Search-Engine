CIA Special Activities Division Operation Officer Max Moore, whose physical looks resemble that of Richard Marcinko, is on a mission in Pakistan to retrieve a high-value target. When the mission goes awry and Moore's allies are killed, he is recalled to the United States to take part in a new effort against the Mexican drug cartels. Moore and his team attempt to infiltrate the cartels and play them off against each other but are met with varying degrees of success. Although they are able to bring down a major kingpin, they are unable to prevent several Muslim terrorists from entering the United States via a smuggling tunnel. The terrorists have brought a number of MANPADS surface-to-air missile launchers with them, which are used to target flights in several US cities. Although the attack is partially successful, Moore and associates are able to stop one of the terrorist teams. Moore is then deployed to Belize on a mission to capture the leader of the terrorist cell. After a boat chase, the leader is captured and sent to a black site for interrogation. The novel ends with Max, having overcome some of his personal demons, now relaxed and on a date with a fellow CIA officer.
