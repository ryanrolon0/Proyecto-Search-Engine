Duesberg's principal assertions are that: * AIDS is not an infectious disease. * HIV as the cause of AIDS fails Koch's postulates. * HIV is a passenger virus unrelated to AIDS. * The symptoms of AIDS are caused by the drugs used to treat the condition; recreational drug use; malnutrition; and unsanitary living conditions. * American public health and science agencies stifle creativity and suppress the true causes of AIDS. The book's central premise, that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, has been completely rejected by the scientific community as a form of AIDS denialism, since HIV has been isolated and shown to be the cause of AIDS.
