This book features numerous recipes for dishes mentioned in the Redwall series, and features illustrations by Christopher Denise. The plot follows Sister Pansy through one cycle of the seasons in Redwall Abbey, as she becomes the Head Cook. The cookbook is divided into the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. As befits the cooking of gentle woodland creatures, all of the recipes (with the exception of the obvious crustacean ingredient in Shrimp'n'Hotroot Soup) are completely vegetarian. Each recipe is preceded by a description of who is making the dish and how it is being prepared. There are also short warnings and anecdotes by the characters sprinkled throughout the text.
