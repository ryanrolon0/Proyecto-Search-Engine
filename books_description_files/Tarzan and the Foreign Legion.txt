While serving in the R.A.F. under his civilian name of John Clayton, Tarzan is shot down over the island of Sumatra in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies. He uses his jungle survival skills to save his comrades in arms, and they fight the Japanese while seeking escape from enemy territory. Tarzan also reveals to his companions how in his youth, after saving the life of a witch doctor, he was rewarded by treatment that gave him immortality. According to Tarzan Alive, Philip José Farmer's study of the ape man's life and career, the incident related occurred in January 1912.
