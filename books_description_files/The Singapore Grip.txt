Broadly satirical in nature, The Singapore Grip details events during the beginning of the Second World War and the Japanese invasion and occupation of Singapore. The action centers around a British family who controls one of the territory's leading trading companies. The title derives from a slang phrase describing a sexual technique sometimes used by prostitutes.
