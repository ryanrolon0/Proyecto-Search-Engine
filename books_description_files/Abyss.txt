Shortly after the Deep Space Nine series finale, Dr. Julian Bashir is once again confronted by Section 31. The group is Starfleet's 'black ops', answerable to no one. They convince Bashir to go take on Locken, a man who had taken over an enemy facility and wishes to re-start a new race of genetically enhanced super-beings. Both Bashir and Locken themselves are genetically enhanced.
