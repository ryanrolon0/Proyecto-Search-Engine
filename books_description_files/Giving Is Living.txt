Giving is Living presents a clear, practical guide to making generosity a part of our everyday lives. It shows us how small efforts to reach out to help those in need can make a real difference. Authors (and sisters) Marnie Howard and Tisha Howard write that to function in a world of limited resources and burgeoning demands, we need provide aid to each other. Through the book, the authors explain that generosity does not have to be about giving money, but can freely and easily extend into our everyday lives.
