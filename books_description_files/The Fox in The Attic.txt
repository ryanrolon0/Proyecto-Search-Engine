The novel opens in 1923. The protagonist, a young Welsh aristocrat named Augustine Penry-Herbert, is incorrectly suspected of having something to do with the accidental death of a young girl whose body he discovers, and so decides to leave England and visit distant relations in Germany. While there he falls in love with his cousin Mitzi, while in the background the rise of Nazism occurs, including the Munich Putsch. At the end of the novel, Mitzi, who has lost her sight, enters a convent, and Augustine returns to England. The second novel in the trilogy, The Wooden Shepherdess, was published in 1973; it carries on the story to 1934 and the Night of the Long Knives. The third and final novel was left unfinished, Hughes realizing that he was unlikely to see it published.
