The 20th Cavalry detachment under the stern commander Colonel McStraggle is besieged by the Cheyenne, because the Indians claim that white men had wantonly killed buffaloes, which the Cheyenne need for their survival. Worse than that is that someone has even provided the Indians with firearms! Lucky Luke volunteers as scout for the 20th Cavalry and quickly finds out that Derek Floyd, a renegade cavalrist is hatching a plot against McStraggle for having kicked him out of the army. The situation for the beleaguered soldiers becomes more desperate as Floyd exploits his insider knowledge of the fort to starve out his ex-comrades.
