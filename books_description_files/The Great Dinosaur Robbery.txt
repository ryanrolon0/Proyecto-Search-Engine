The book is set in New York City in the 1970s, and follows attempts by a group of British nannies who discover that a microdot containing Chinese military secrets that they believe to be vital to the survival of the British Empire has been hidden in a skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History. They cannot find the message, so contrive to steal the entire skeleton and mail it to the Queen. The Chinese agents who hope to retrieve the message, and the Americans searching for the missing dinosaur, play important roles.
