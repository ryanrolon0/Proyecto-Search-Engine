The narrative of The Macdermots of Ballycloran "chronicles the tragic demise of a landowning family. Larry Macdermot lives in a dilapidated mansion in Co. Leitrim, whose mortgage (enforced by his enemy, the vulgar builder Joe Flannelly) he cannot keep up. Enmity between the Macdermot and Flannelly families is sharpened by Larry's having declined to marry Joe's daughter, Sally. Macdermot's daughter, Feemy, is herself seduced by the locally hated English police officer, Captain Myles Ussher. Ussher, who enforces the excise laws against poteen distilling, is murdered by Feemy's brother, Thady. He is hanged, his father Larry goes mad, Feemy dies bearing Ussher's bastard and the Ballycloran house is finally vacated of Macdermots."
