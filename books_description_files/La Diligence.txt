Due to an increasing rate of stagecoach holdups, Wells Fargo & Co. decides to organize and conduct a special trip with a load of gold from Denver to San Francisco, with Lucky Luke participating as an escort, to reboost the company's failing public image. As expected, the stagecoach becomes the target for various hold-up attempts, in addition to an Indian attack, an encounter with the bandit poet Black Bart, various on-board gambling sessions, and a continuous diet of bacon and potatoes (as prescribed by the company). In the end the gold not only arrives safely in San Francisco, but also the passengers have gained some new personal insights from that trip.
