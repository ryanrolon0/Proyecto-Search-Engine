Jody, a young single red-headed woman living in San Francisco, is attacked by a vampire and soon finds that she's become one herself. While trying to adjust to her new nocturnal lifestyle, she's aided by C. Thomas (Tommy) Flood, a wannabe writer who just moved to town and works as a night clerk (and champion "turkey bowler") at a local Safeway. As Jody and Tommy begin their life together (and become attracted to each other), they also discover that a recent string of mysterious murders may be the work of the vampire who attacked Jody. To get to the bottom of the matter, they engage the help of Tommy's coworkers ("the Animals") and an eccentric street person known as "The Emperor."
