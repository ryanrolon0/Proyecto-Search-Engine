The story begins in April with the novel's main character, Kathy Ross, and her husband Dan attending a funeral for their old friend. While at the graveyard, Kathy sees a woman placing flowers on a grave. Curiously, Kathy goes to the woman, who looks at her in surprise and runs off. When Kathy views the gravestone she notices something unusual about it: there is only one name "Tilly" and one date, exactly nine years ago. Later, once at home, Kathy begins to feel deeply guilty about something. She asks Dan about her ability as a mother and he tells her that she had always been good to their three children. However, Kathy still feels ashamed of herself. That night, Kathy has the most strange dream. When she looks at her backyard she sees many children playing. When she asks them what they are doing they say that they live there. When she asks them their names they tell her they don't have any. When she asks about their parents, the children respond that they have none. Kathy then notices one girl, who says her name is Tilly, the same name found on the gravestone. Tilly takes Kathy to her favorite places in heaven and talks to her about Jesus. The two of them soon become good friends. Meanwhile, Dan investigates the tiny gravestone. He soon meets with the woman whom he and Kathy saw in the graveyard. Her name turns out to be Anita Mendoza, a former abortion clinic nurse. She tells Dan that she recognizes his wife from many years ago. Tilly, she tells him, was the late-term fetus that Kathy aborted. Tilly, however, had lived through the procedure but died moments later. Afterward, Anita insisted on burying the mangled corpse. Kathy, still in her dream, continues talking with Tilly. She informs her that she, unlike the other children, does have a mother. Tilly informs Kathy that she forgives her for what she did. Once Kathy wakes up she no longer feels guilty about her past abortion. The story ends with her thinking about all the children who "have no mothers".
