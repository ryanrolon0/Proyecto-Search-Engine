In a story introduced by the ubiquitous Una Persson (who is also found in other works by Moorcock), the trilogy's hero, Captain Oswald Bastable, finds himself in an alternative twentieth century in which the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War and the October Revolution never occurred. Over the course of the story Oswald witnesses the destruction of Singapore at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Aerial Navy, is imprisoned on Rishiri, joins the Russian Imperial Airship Navy and is sent too put down the rebellious Cossacks under 'The Steel Tsar' otherwise known as Dugashvili, who is known to the real world as Joseph Stalin. He also experiences a repeat of events from the first novel as he is forced to drop an atomic bomb on the anarchist Nestor Makhno and his Black Flag Army.
