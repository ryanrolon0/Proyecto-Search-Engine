Tulasi is a 10 year-old child of a rich man Sridhar and Sharada. Anita is her sister. Sridhar saves the daughter of his boss Robert. As a gratitude, he presents Rs. 10 lakhs in the name of Tulasi. If she dies before the age of 10 years, the money goes to Sri Krishna Saranalayam. She was witch-crafted by some enemies of her father for getting the money. Kadra has applied "Kashmora" on her, as a result she becomes serious sick. She is expected to be killed by its effects in 21 days time. The story is about the attempts by four persons (father and mother, Abrakadabra and Ismail) to save her from death.
