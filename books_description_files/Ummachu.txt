The novel begins with a depiction of the playful childhood of a naughty threesome - Ummachu, Mayan and Beeran. Ummachu, the charming daughter of Athar Ali, finds herself drawn to the strong and sturdy Mayan. But, ironically enough, she becomes Beeran's bride, much to her dislike. Ummachu confesses later: "What can I do, a hapless girl?" The novel covers two generations and signifies the dawn of the third. It also tracks the feud-ridden family tales, which are narrated by `historian' Ahammadunni. The focus is on `Ummachu.' The other protagonists who gain prominence are her close associates - Mayan, Beeran and Chappunni Nair. Assertive and impulsive, Chinnammu is said to be modelled on Ummachu; the mould may be the same, but each pursues a different path of her own.
