Twilight on the Trail

 Hoppy, Lucky and California are chasing cattle rustlers who have been bothering cattle rancher friends of Hoppy. A crooked foreman is the source of the trouble. Johnny and Lucy are the love focus. Rustlers are raiding in Antelope Valley and Jim Brent, owner of the Circle Y Ranch, sends for eastern detectives to catch them. The detectives arrive and, much to the disgust of Brent, his daughter Lucy, and the other cattlemen, they turn out to be a trio of foppish dudes. But, in reality, they are 'Hopalong" Cassidy and his sidekicks, "California" Carlson and Johnny Nelson, dressed in order to throw the outlaws off their guard...and also do the same for the kids in the front row. Brent's cattle are being rustled and he has sent for Hoppy who arrives with California and Johnny. The three pose as dude English detectives but their identity is quickly revealed when they have to fight off the rustlers. When Hoppy and California finally find the rustler's hideout they also find themselves prisoners.
