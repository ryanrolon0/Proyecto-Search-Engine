Reveries from Cistae Memoria

 Reveries explores the subjective and oneiric journeys through fragmented and reconstructed memories. Wunderkabinettes and pre-cinema optical toy imagery helps describe the steps of memory creation, transformation, and storage, while weaving stories of the filmmaker's grandparents with fabricated memories to impress on the viewer the sublime beauty of these fractured memories.
