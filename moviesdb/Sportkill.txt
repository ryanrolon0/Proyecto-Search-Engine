Sportkill

 Rachel's life will never be the same the world of high stakes betting, Rachel must decide to play, or be played. Could you inflict pain on another in order to survive? From director Craig McMahon (Machined) comes a look into the gentlemen's club SportKill... The mortician Rachel is kidnapped and forced to participate in a sick contest against other victims for her own survival in a private club hosted by Ivan for an audience of gamblers that bet high stakes. Each player that denies participating in the sick game shall choose between the wooden structure, meaning to be buried alive; or The Assassin, meaning to be murdered by a killer.
