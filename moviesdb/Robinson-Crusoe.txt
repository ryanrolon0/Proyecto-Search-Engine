Robinson Crusoe

 Is the year 3089 and technology has exceeded all expectations. Space travel is now common place and humans have met a race of aliens who call themselves Karomingiens. This was an initially friendly race, before a group of Karomingian scientists traveled in the earth's past, downloading for research, the brain information of one of the most devious humans of the 20th Century Central Unit and took control over the entire alien civilization, downgrading their political system to Fascism. Now, Karomingian Nazis have only one objective of only one pure race, theirs.
