Rosa Was Here

 One morning, Rosa and her friends awake to find that all people over the age of 16 have disappeared. Rosa is due to turn 16 in a few days, and she and her friends spend their last days riotously. A very confusing movie with no apparent message, made even more confused by the ending.
