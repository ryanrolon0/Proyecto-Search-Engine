The Girl from Manhattan

 Tom Walker,former All-American fullback who gave up football to enter the ministry, returns to his old home town for his first assignment under the church Bishop , an old friend of his father. And Carol Maynard , a local girl who has become New York's most famous model, comes home to visit her uncle, Homer Purdy, a boarding-house keeper.She is dismayed to learn that the money she has been sending him to pay off his $3000 mortgage has been going to a bunch of non-paying guests, among them Aaror Goss, a radio contest fanatic, and a broken-down actress, Mrs. Brooke. Tom and Carol resume their romance which was interrupted when he went away to college and she to New York. This upsets the Bishop. Mr. Birch, holds the mortgage on Purdy's boarding house and is going to foreclose, and donate the property to Tom's church for a new building. Tom, clearly, has a conflict-of-interest situation on his hands. A small-town girl who's made it big in New York as a fashion model returns home, only to find that her somewhat dotty uncle has mortgaged his boarding house to the hilt. In her efforts to help him keep his boarding house, she becomes involved with a handsome young minister and his superior, an older bishop.
