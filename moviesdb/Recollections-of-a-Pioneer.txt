Recollections of a Pioneer

 Recollections of a Pioneer is a lyrical documentary film that highlights the vast, natural beauty of the Big Bend region of west Texas. The main characters are the legendary Hallie Stillwell and the spectacular, remote ranch she came to as a young bride in 1918. Off screen narration and an ethereal music score serve to illuminate and heighten the rich, lingering images that are revealed with a meditative visual and editing style.
