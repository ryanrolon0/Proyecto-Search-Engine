Short Ends

 Frankie and Johnny wake up to realise their precious elixir of life is gone. They go out into the streets of London to try to find it in a paranoid world. Their alchemist friend thinks he has found it, but a children's colony reveals to them it is all a dream, and they return home, but the police kills one of them.
