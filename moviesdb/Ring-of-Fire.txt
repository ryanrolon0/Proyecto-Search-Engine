Ring of Fire

 In an animated landscape of the Old West, a reflective man is the partner of what seems to be his spectral doppelgänger. As the man drinks, lies around, and waits for the good, then waits for anything, then fails, the doppelgänger takes up with a woman with long hair. She's playful and open, and he takes advantage of her trust. Can there be a healing and rebirth? What will bring it?
