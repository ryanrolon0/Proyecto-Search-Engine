The Thing About Dolphins

 Brodie may only be a half-baked barista at a crappy shopping mall, but he's got shit figured out, man. He can see the truth of things, and he saw something the other day that you wouldn't believe... Introverted photographer Dave is full of uncertainty. He's thinking of leaving his beautiful wife, Leslie, but isn't really sure why. It's going to take a major moment of revelation for things to become clear... In the strange spaces where these stories collide, exists The Thing About Dolphins. Part absurdest comedy and part surreal drama, the film is an oddly moving exploration of the divide between feeling and understanding - one which may, or may not, feature actual dolphins.
