The Police Quartette

 The desk sergeant, in dress uniform, takes a call from the chief. Three colleagues enter and he tells them that the chief wants them over at the orphanage to perform. They practice four numbers in barbershop quartet harmony enjoy - a Mother Goose medley of four nursery rimes sung simultaneously - "Little Jack Horner" (alto), "Sing a Song of Sixpence" (tenor), "Little Bo Peep" (baritone), and "Pease Porridge" (bass). Next is a medley of "Cluckin'" and "You Tell Me Your Dream." They conclude with the ragtime "Waddle" and a bow.
