The Snow Man

 Three bunny rabbits are having fun play with a jovial snowman who has come to life. But along comes a villainous bear who wants to put the snowman on a hot stove. But also along comes the Friendly North Wind, as opposed to the Unfiendly North Wind, who rescues the snowman and reunites him with the bunnies.
