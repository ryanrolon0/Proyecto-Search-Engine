Vietnow and Then

 Accounts of the U.S.'s role in the conflicts in Southeast Asia often overlook the experiences of the Vietnamese experience. In this feature length documentary film, first generation immigrants and second generation Vietnamese-American youths explore the stories that are often ignored in history textbooks-instead, asking their parents, grandparents and community leaders to tell them about their personal experiences that lead them to a life in the United States.
