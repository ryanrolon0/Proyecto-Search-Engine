The Journal of Edmond Deyers

 A heinous crime takes place in a remote town and a familiar blood soaked scene was left to be cleaned up. A young officer takes notes on the crime scene so he can go over the case with the now seasoned Officer Noels. The legendary(in the occult) journal of Edmond Deyers is recovered from the crime scene and an 'eye-witness' account leaves local police in awe.
