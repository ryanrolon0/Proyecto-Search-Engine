She & He

 She & He is a 12-minute short film based on the play of the same name, which captured 1st prize at the 2005 Nantucket Short Play Festival. It was adapted to the screen by Greg Bourbeau. It tells the story of an educated man who is recalling a moment in time that he and his wife shared. This couple takes a retrospective look at their long and tempestuous married life by re-living particular events. This is all accomplished by only using one or two words to describe each personal experience or a moment in history. The conversation takes place in a hospital room and as the conversation evolves the husband becomes aware that his wife has received a dire prognosis. This prompts them both to admitting to events that they would rather forget but only proves to enhance their love for each other.
