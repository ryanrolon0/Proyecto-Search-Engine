Replay Revenge

 This film looks at how Palestinians and Israelis try to cope with the situation. Palestinians talk of the wall that separates them from their neighbours; Israelis speak of what it's like to take public transportation on bus routes that have been bombed; Israeli students express how they wish things were different, while landlocked Palestinians discuss their frustrations and hopes for the future. Basil Khalil's cousin Johnny, from Nazareth, offers some words of wisdom - somewhat pessimistic, while others in the area have thoughts of hope.
