Topsy and Bunker

 Topsy (Gunderson) and Bunker (Robertson) are two misfits living in a run-down, fleabag hotel in a corner of Manhattan that time has passed by. They spend their time weaving fantasies of ever more complicated deviousness until, one night, a game goes horribly wrong and the result is the death of a local character named Grace (Stoller). Now, try as they might, the harsh light of day won't leave Topsy and Bunker alone. Reality is coming
