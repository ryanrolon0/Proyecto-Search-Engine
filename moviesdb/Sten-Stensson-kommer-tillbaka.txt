Sten Stensson kommer tillbaka

 Sten Stensson has been challenged by a professor of law in a TV gameshow. Stensson, always fighting against immorality, comes to Stockholm a few days before the the broadcast to teach the young generation how to behave. A gang of crooks mistakes him for a famous dynamitard they have been waiting for.
