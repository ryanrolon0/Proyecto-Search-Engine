Unlocking Apollo

 Dogger Banks just lost Everything...his credit, his girlfriend, his job, his car, his house...his whole life. And it's all HER fault. Slick identity thief Apollo Lucas weasels her way into Dogger Banks' life and decides that she's never, EVER going to leave. Plucking his precious security from between his fingers, Apollo establishes headquarters for her crime ring venture...inside Dogger's house. Banished to living in a cardboard box in the backyard, Dogger resolves to get his life back, but he finds that the struggle carries a cost he's not sure he's willing to pay.
