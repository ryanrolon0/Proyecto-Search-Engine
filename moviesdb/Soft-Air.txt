Soft Air

 A group of young men from the upper-middle class in modern-day Italy, bored from the activities of everyday life, participate to a simulated-war "Wargame" match played with Soft-Air gun replicas (hence the title), only to find out that the opposing team is a group of foreign mercenaries on the loose that takes such occasions for training and gratuitously killing innocents.
