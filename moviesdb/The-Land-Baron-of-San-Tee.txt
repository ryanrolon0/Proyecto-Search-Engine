The Land Baron of San Tee

 The wealthy land baron orders the water supply shut off and an armed guard is stationed to protect the dam. The baron's foreman, Jim Mallory, is in love with Clara Blair, the daughter of a poor old widow, and plans to take advantage of her helplessness. When their water supply gives out, Clara hurries to the baron and tells him of her sick mother, but is refused even a canteen of the fluid. She returns home in despair where Jim Mallory follows her and offers her a canteen of water for a kiss. She indignantly refuses and hurries to her mother, but the sight of her mother's suffering forces her back to accept the foreman's offer. He hurries away believing that he now has her in his power and can enforce any demand. A stranger comes to San Tee and stops at the home of the widow. He asks Clara for water and is told of the famine. He goes to the dam and fills his canteen, is fired upon by the guard and in returning their fire seriously wounds one of them. The baron is sent for and he hurries on the trail of the stranger seeking vengeance. Lurking in the undergrowth the stranger awaits his coming and captures him. He ties him to a tree and hurries to the widow's home for salt. The foreman is there and forcing his unwelcome attentions on the helpless girl. She screams for help and the stranger arrives..
