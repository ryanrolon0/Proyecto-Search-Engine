Ruang rak noi nid mahasan

 A mysterious, obsessive-compulsive, suicidal Japanese man living in Bangkok, Thailand, is thrown together with a Thai woman through a tragic chain of events. The woman is everything he is not. He is a neat freak who keeps his dishes washed and his books neatly stacked and categorized. She dresses like a slob, smokes pot and never picks anything up. It's a match that somehow works, though. Slowly and entertainingly, more is revealed about the Japanese man and why he's suicidal and living in Bangkok. An obsessive-compulsive Japanese librarian living in Bangkok spends most of his empty days contemplating suicide alone in his lifeless apartment. His life completely changes when he witnesses the death of Nid seconds before he was about to jump off a bridge. This pivotal event paired the lost Japanese with Nid's elder sister Noi as these two lost and lonely souls help each other find the meaning to their meaningless existences.
