The Cock-Eyed World

 Two Marines who spend their lives battling each other find themselves stationed in Russia, where they fight over a sexy Russian girl; from there they go to Brooklyn, where they both set their sights on a pretty blonde who flirts outrageously with both of them; and finally they wind up in a South American country where they fight for the favors of a beautiful senorita and try to put down a rebellion by the locals at the same time.
