River High

 Eastern Europe is famous for its harsh winters. So the few weeks each year when the sun does shine brightly, most Ukrainians take full advantage of it, none more so than the spirited group of youngsters in Baikal Films' latest effort 'RIVER HIGH'. Join a dozen rambunctious boys, on the cusp of adolescence, as they undertake an adventurous trek deep into the Ukrainian forest for an overnight camp-out. With forty-eight hours of joyous freedom, they get a chance to enjoy the precious sunshine, show off their athletic skills and even don a little war-paint. All in all, great fun-in-the-sun memories to enjoy all year 'round!
