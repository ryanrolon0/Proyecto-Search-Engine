The Chump Champ

 Droopy and Spike find themselves competing in a series of athletic events. As always, Droopy plays fair and square, while Spike tries to cheat every chance he gets. And as always, every scheme Spike sets out ends up blowing up in his face, while Droopy, blissfully unaware of it all, marches on to victory in every event.
