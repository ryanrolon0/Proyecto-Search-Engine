The Affair of an Egg

 A whimsical farm girl writes a message on an egg that finds its way to a city restaurant where it is served to a young man. Intrigued, the young man sets out to locate the message-writer. He makes the long and arduous trip by train to the country and confronts the young woman, who, much to his dismay, doubles up her fists and hits him. The next scene shows the young man boarding a train, and the young woman on her knees beseeching him to return to her.
