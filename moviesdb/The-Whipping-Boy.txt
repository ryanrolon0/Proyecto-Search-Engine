The Whipping Boy

 The king of tiny German Brandenberg hopes in vain his lazy, unruly heir Boris will behave for the sake of his whipping boy, abandoned commoner Tom, whom he had absurdly arrested as later his kid sister Annyrose, who lands in jail. Alas Boris only regrets Tom bravely fails to wince or whine when whipped for the prince's faults. After Boris's tomfoolery sabotages vital border negotiations with related king Philip's ambassador, he flees the king with Tom. They get kidnapped, and Boris learns to appreciate his street-smart 'inferior' while growing up a little. The king realizes emotionally neglecting Boris is, the root of his pranks for attention.
