Verwirrung der Liebe

 Slatan Dudow's best-known and last completed film, a big-budget production featuring Angelica Domroese (of later The Legend of Paul and Paula fame), Annekatrin Bürger and Willi Schrade. The film ran into trouble with official socialist morality due to its frank depiction of sex (including nude bathing scenes) and portrayal of consumerism, along with a very stylized version of comedy.
