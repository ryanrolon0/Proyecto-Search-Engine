Shadow girl - La fille de l'ombre

 Kim is a paid assassin. Having lost her parents at the age of five, she was raised by John, who became her Pygmalion and taught her the art of killing. John gave her an education, a sense of usefulness, but no identity. By seeking her true identity, Kim hopes to be able to escape her fate. Her quest will lead her to discover that she is nothing but a pawn in Machiavellian hands.
