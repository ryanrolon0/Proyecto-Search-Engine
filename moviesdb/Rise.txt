Rise

 Celebrates American figure skating while commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1961 U.S. World Figure Skating Team that perished in a plane crash on its way to the World Championships in Prague. Produced and directed by 16-time Emmy Award winners Lookalike Productions, RISE documents the sports' growth in popularity over the years and features various luminaries of American figure skating. Proceeds from RISE will be used to further the mission of U.S. Figure Skating's Memorial Fund, which was established on Feb. 23, 1961, as a living legacy of those who lost their lives. The film's Feb. 17, 2011, premiere coincides with the 50th anniversary of the tragedy.
