Pong 3

 Freedom fighter Sam-po learns that his location has been discovered by the Japanese police so he flees in the night but not before leaving his girlfriend, Ahn Ak, behind as collateral on his gambling debts. Ahn Ak is uneducated and has no job skills, so the debtor forces her to work as a prostitute if she wants to earn her freedom.
