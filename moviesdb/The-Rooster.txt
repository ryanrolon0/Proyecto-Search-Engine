The Rooster

 The end of a relationship sucks. Inevitably, one person is left feeling bereft, suddenly transformed into a mopey fun-sucking blob. They've lost their 'better half'. They've lost their confidence. They've lost hope. And they've lost their rooster. From the writer of 'Recount' comes a screenplay that explores what we actually lose when a relationship ends and how far one man will go to recover his coc-, er, rooster.
