The Outdoorsmen

 Once a year, an exclusive group of men travels to a top-secret location somewhere in the wooded mountains of Washington State to compete in an all-day event they call The Outdoorsmen. They battle their way through a series of events that combine physical challenges with high-speed beer chugging. For the past 4 years, this dedicated group has competed relentlessly to bask in the glory of winning the coveted title of Outdoorsmen Champion. As we examine the lives and friendships of the "Veteran" and "Newbie" Outdoorsmen, we discover a tradition of male bonding and whole-hearted dedication to a competition that pushes its players through events like DEATH RACE 3000, THE HATCHET TOSS, and BLIND MAN'S BEER. Braving freezing waters, treacherous riverbeds, and the rapid consumption of over 30 cases of beer, the Outdoorsmen revel in the rush of adrenaline they get out of this once a year break from the responsibilities of the 9 to 5 world. These men get to be responsible parents, husbands, and co-workers for 362 days a year, but for one weekend they reach back to recapture their youth and cherish the camaraderie of their fellow Outdoorsmen.
