Tossers

 There has always been controversy in the shoe-tossing community, but the first has grown as speed tossing, extreme tossing, and corporate sponsored tossing gain notoriety. Featuring a rare interview with Joe Hoffenbeck, passionate shoe-tossing icon from an era gone by, Tossers explores the divide between the old and new generation of tossers. The old guard argue that the art has been lost and the kids have sold out. The new guard, such as high-profile tosser Jimmy 'The Lace' Santino, believe they have every right to toss. In the middle is Lily Hoffenbeck, Joe's wife and long-time supporter of the art, who believes each side might have something to learn from the other, if they would only stop to listen.
