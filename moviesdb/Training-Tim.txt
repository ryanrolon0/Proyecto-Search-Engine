Training Tim

 Training Tim is a Cinderella story turned sideways. Carol is reluctantly turning 30 with no love life to speak of and a dead end job that brings her little enjoyment. She decides to take a logical approach after falling head over heels for sportscaster, Tim Masterson. Confronted with Tim's bachelor mentality, Carol enlists the help of her sister, an expert dog trainer, to train Tim to be the boyfriend she's always dreamed about. Things quickly get out-of-hand and Carol's relationship-boot camp needs more than canine experience to put things back on the love track. Carol thinks she's training Tim, but quickly realizes that love isn't always trainable.
