Through Walls

 Charlie Herron is a failure. He is the perfect caricature of a young, struggling artist whose work is unoriginal and bland. It is only with the arrival of a mysterious and seductive art dealer, Liz Meyers, that his life begins to change. When she tells him that his work is "gutless," he resolves to better himself. Unexpectedly, Charlie finds fresh inspiration in the ominous shrieks and shouts he hears from the apartment of his new next door neighbor, Adam. As his mind races through grave scenarios, he is able to create exquisite works of art. Charlie and Adam begin an unspoken symbiotic relationship and Charlie's artistic success surges. But his success comes at a dangerous price. As the noises next door become more and more disturbing, Charlie is forced to recognize the reality of what he cannot see, but can only hear through walls.
