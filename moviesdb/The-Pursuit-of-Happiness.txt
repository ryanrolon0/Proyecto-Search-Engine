The Pursuit of Happiness

 A young college student is sent to prison as much for killing a pedestrian with his car as for not paying his parking tickets. When the opportunity presents itself he escapes and is subsequently on the run with his girlfriend. But how long can this situation last? William Popper comes from a wealthy, traditionally Protestant family. His family and most of the established class see William as an anti-social crusader. Almost completed college in New York City, William is a compassionate but directionless man who has no idea what he will do with his life after he graduates. All he knows is that he loves his activist Jewish girlfriend, Jane Kauffman. His life changes when one rainy evening, he accidentally runs over and kills an elderly woman. In dealing with this situation, he wants to do the right thing at every turn, but doesn't like that to save himself from conviction and a prison sentence he has to be politically correct and put on a mask to satisfy those with authority. However, the more he tries to do the right thing, the more trouble he seems to get into. On an impulse, he seizes an opportunity so that he can get to a place where he feels he can make sense of life in general.
