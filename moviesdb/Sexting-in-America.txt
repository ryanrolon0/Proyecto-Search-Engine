Sexting in America

 From top TV shows to hit songs, "Sexting in America Public," explores the recent emergence of 'sexting' in pop culture and looks at which celebrities have been caught hitting "send." The special also takes an in-depth look at the pervasiveness and consequences of 'sexting' - the act of sending or forwarding nude, sexually suggestive, or explicit pictures on your cell or online - as MTV explores who is doing it, why teens and young adults hit "forward" instead of "delete," and what happens when hitting "send" really isn't the end.
