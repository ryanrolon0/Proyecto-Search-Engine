The Saddle Buster

 Having proved he can ride a bucking bronco with the best of them, young drifter Montana is hired on at Dan Hearn's rodeo ranch. Montana is in for a rougher ride than he figured on when both Dan's daughter Sunny and his top female rodeo rider Rita take a shine to him. The pressure really is turned on when ace saddle buster Rance, jealous over Rita's attention to Montana, goads Montana into riding Wild Fury, a man-killing stallion nobody has ever successfully ridden before.
