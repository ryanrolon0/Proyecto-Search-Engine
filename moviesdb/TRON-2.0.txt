TRON 2.0

 20 years after the events of TRON, Encom, the computer company in the film, is in the midst of a hostile takeover bid by a rival firm called fCon. fCon found that Alan Bradley, the programmer who helped out Kevin Flynn 20 years earlier, has rediscovered the same digitising technology that sent Flynn into the computer world, and they want it for themselves. By digitizing specially trained hackers codenamed DataWraiths, fCon plans to infiltrate the world's computer networks from the inside. When an fCon employee called Thorne, who was a former security chief at Encom, is digitised into the computer incorrectly, he begins to go mad and corrupt the entire system from within, infecting and destroying other programs in the process. When Alan Bradley suddenley goes missing, his son Jet, who is a programmer at Encom, is digitised against his will into the computer system to find him and stop the corruption that is destroying the computer world.
