Punane viiul

 It has to be said that it's one of the Soviet propaganda movies. But it's not the worst one. Eduard is a high-level violin-player. He is also a convinced communist. He loves his homeland Estonia but unfortunately after the WW-1 bloody burghers rule the country. As Eduard dares to fight for equality and freedom, he will be persecuted by authorities.
