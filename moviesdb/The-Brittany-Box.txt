The Brittany Box

 Kyle is a high school student with an embarrassing secret... and everybody is about to find out. For years he has had a crippling crush on Brittany, the most beautiful girl in school, and for years he has been secretly stealing her stuff which he hides in a shoebox under his bed. He has gotten away with it all this time because the girl he loves pretty much doesn't know he exist, but that is all going to change today. This hilarious nine minute short that won The Ringling College of Art + Design's Best of Ringling Award will take you in completely unexpected directions and keep you laughing for days.
