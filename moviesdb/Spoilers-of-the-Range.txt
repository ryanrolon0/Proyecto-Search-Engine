Spoilers of the Range

 Beginning as usual with The Sons of the Pioneers singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" over the opening title and credit frames, which should be how all Westerns begin, especially those westerns of the 50's and 60's that used insipid title songs telling the plot before the film started, this one wastes no time as Lobo Savage (Dick Curtis' (qv)) secretly in league with saloon owner Cash Fenton ('Kenneth MacDonald (I)' (qv)) steals the $50,000 raised by the ranchers for Mesa Verde's new dam. Fenton agrees to lend the ranchers new money---their old money of course---to complete the dam on the condition their cattle are driven to market by a certain date in order to repay the loan. Then Lobo and his henchies set out to make certain the ranchers can't meet the deadline. Jeff Strong ('Charles Starrett' (qv)) discovers the connection between Savage and Fenton, and he and his cowhands, the Sons of the Pioneers ('Sons of the Pioneers' (qv)), begin the battle to defeat Savage and Fenton.
