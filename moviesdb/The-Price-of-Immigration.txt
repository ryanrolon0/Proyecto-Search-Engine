The Price of Immigration

 People risk their lives to cross the border into the United States - fence and guards be damned - because there isn't work at home to feed and support their families. This short documentary highlights the life of 'Jose,' an unauthorized immigrant from Mexico who came to the United States five years ago, when he was 17. Dr. James Johnson, a business professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, provides broad context for the economic impact of unauthorized immigrants working in the United States. You might be surprised by what you learn.
