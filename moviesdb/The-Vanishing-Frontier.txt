The Vanishing Frontier

 Its 1850 and California is under ruthless military rule. Kirby Tornell's rancho has been taken over by soldiers and when two of Kirby's men are captured, he goes there to free them. He meets the General's daughter there and attracted to her, repeatedly returns to see her. Eventually he is captured and now his men must try and rescue him. Shortly after being admitted to the Union, California was under military rule while awaiting for a government to be set up. Factions with influence with the military began taking money, land and property away from its rightful owners. Kirby Tornell, of Spanish-American heritage, loses his rancho to this criminal group and decides to strike back; he organizes a guerrilla band that robs the robbers and returns the property to its rightful owners. General Winfield, the U. S. Military governor, has been hoodwinked by the land-grabbers and thinks Tornell to be an outlaw and sends his troops out to capture Tornell.
