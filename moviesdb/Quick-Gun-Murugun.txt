Quick Gun Murugun

 Quick Gun Murugun is a western spoof with attitude, featuring outlandish songs, outrageous melodrama and crazy action sequences including a classic duel in a traffic jam. The film tells the story of Quick Gun Murugun - a South Indian karmic cowboy whose duty is to protect and cows. When faced with a world-conquering arch villain restaurant owner who wants to create the ultimate McDosa chain using beef, Quick Gun enters into an epic battle of vegetarianism vs. non-vegetarianism that spans time and space, from a small South Indian village to an Indian heaven and then finally to a cosmopolitan Mumbai across 15 years.
