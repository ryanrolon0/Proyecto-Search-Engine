The Road Hustlers

 The Reedys are a family of moonshiners plying their trade in the deep south. A criminal syndicate is trying to corner the bootleg liquor market by inducing all the local moon-shiners to come under their 'protection'. Only the Reedys have turned down their offers and remained independent, so the syndicate decides to teach them a lesson. At the same time, a pair of federal agents is trying (and failing) to crack down on all of the alcohol smuggling going on.
