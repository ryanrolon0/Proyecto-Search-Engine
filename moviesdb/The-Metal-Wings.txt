The Metal Wings

 Stacy Smith is missing... and Dawn Clemons thinks she knows where to find her. All she has to do is convince her genius brother Jason that his newest invention - a pair of rocket propelled metal wings - are worth putting to good use. But the increasingly reclusive Jason sees little in the modern world that threatens his cynical world view - if it's problems can't be solved, then why try? Determined to prove to her brother that his invention is worth something (and convinced she's found the clues she needs to solve the mystery), Dawn takes on the search by herself, bringing the wings along with her. But will such drastic measures save the girl, or will they only lead to a vain end for the search and it's searcher?
