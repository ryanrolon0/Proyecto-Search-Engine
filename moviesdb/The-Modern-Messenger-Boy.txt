The Modern Messenger Boy

 The story opens in a well-appointed messenger station with the usual gathering of messenger boys, joking and playing tricks on each other. Izzy, the hero of the story, is the ringleader of the lot, and it is he who usually receives the greatest number of messages to deliver, chiefly because the manager wants to keep him out of the office. Izzy is given a number of messages to deliver, but on the way he becomes mixed in all sorts of mischief. Finally a chase is started after him, but he eludes his pursuers and returns to the office. The other boys are joking him because of his big day's work, when they have been comparatively idle. But they are made envious when Izzy exhibits the fruits of his day's work, several dollars in hard cash.
