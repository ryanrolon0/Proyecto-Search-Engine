Under the Hood

 At the office of a seedy auto repair shop staffed by the obnoxious manager Ed, and his laid-back mechanic Dick, an attractive female client, Sofi, attempts to get her car fixed for the umpteenth time. Ed wants Sofi in the worst possible way, but Sofi definitely doesn't want Ed. However she does like Dick, and Dick likes her back, but when Ed witnesses their mutual attraction and throws a spanner in the works, the barometer of sexual tension begins to slip into the danger zone, until an unexpected development causes frustrations to boil over in an explosive finale.
