The New Daughter

 John James is a writer; his wife has left him. He moves with his two middle-school children to an isolated house off a dirt road in South Carolina. The property has an Indian burial mound, which fascinates his daughter, Louisa, who's entering puberty. Strange things roof and in the woods, the cat missing, Luisa sleepwalking clutching a straw doll no one's seen before. She visits the mound often, staying late, coming home covered with mud. John's younger son, Sam, is frightened. John learns the house has a history and seeks out the previous owner. Louisa's behavior becomes more bizarre. Is there an explanation? An ant farm and a missing babysitter provide clues. The just divorced writer John James moves to an isolated old house in the woods in Mercy, South Caroline, with his teenager daughter Louisa and his son Sam. Louisa misses her mother Isabel and finds an Indian burial mound in the real estate, where she likes to go. Sooner Louisa changes her behavior but her teacher Cassandra Parker believes that the cause is puberty associated to the new lifestyle in a new place and without the mother. When John learns that a tragedy has happened in the house in the past, he hires the babysitter Mrs. Amworth that was recommended by Cassandra and travels to Charleston to seek out the previous owner Roger Wayne that tells details of the tragedy. When he returns, Mrs. Amworth is missing and sooner John finds what is happening with his daughter.
