Pope Michael

 A man who believes he is the rightfully elected pope of the Roman Catholic church welcomes two young seminarians into his rural Kansas home to spread the word of his election. Along the way they make presentations at universities, deal with the disapproval and hostility of family members, and reconcile their lofty dreams of global conversion with an ever-growing set of problems and hurdles to overcome.
