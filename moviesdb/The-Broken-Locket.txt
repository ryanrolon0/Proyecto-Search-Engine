The Broken Locket

 Before George goes out west to earn his fortune, he and Ruth each take half of a broken locket as a pledge of their love. Out west, George becomes a drunk, and is seduced by a girl who writes to Ruth, telling her that George is dead. In shock, Ruth becomes feverish and loses her sight. Later, when George returns a broken-down drunk, Ruth can't see what a sad mess he's become, and is joyous at his return.
