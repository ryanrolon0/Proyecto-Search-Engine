Slice of Pie

 "Slice of Pie" is a romantic comedy with an unlikely hero. Carter's a middle-aged divorcEe with his eye on Juanita, the waitress at the local diner. In an attempt to woo the girl of his dreams he waxes philosophical about the merits of pie. But when James, the used car dealer of dating, makes his move on Juanita, subtly is out the window. Carter pops the question, Juanita accepts and Carter thinks he has the wind at his back. But in the open prairie land of central Illinois, the wind can change direction rather quickly. Slice of Pie is a cinematic slice of life chock full of the bittersweet moments set against a back drop of quirky locals that Carter grew up with. Oh yeah, and a dead dog named Burt.
