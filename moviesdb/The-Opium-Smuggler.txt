The Opium Smuggler

 Bonnie is the daughter of Peter Watson, a fisherman, who derives a comfortable living for himself and family from the historic waters of old Monterey Bay, on the California coast. Watson has chosen as a husband for his daughter Tony Laredo, who, with no apparent vocation, lives a life of ease. Bonnie, however, is in love with Ned Raymond, a young fisherman, and this love is returned with interest. Ned is suspicious of Laredo, and discovers him at the illicit traffic of opium smuggling. While spying upon the smugglers at work in their den he is attacked from behind, falls from a cliff, is carried to the den and left still unconscious. He soon recovers, however, and surprising Laredo at work in the entrance to the den, takes him captive. Watson, who has gone out in his boat to fish, is delayed, far beyond his usual time of return, and his wife is greatly worried. Leaving Bonnie to guard the prisoner, Ned and Mrs. Watson go to the shore, and discover Watson, his boat capsized, battling with the waves. Two men have just landed on the beach, and Ned, jumping into the boat, commands them to make haste that they may save the drowning man. After a strenuous battle with the waves, Watson is rescued more dead than alive, rowed to the beach and carried to the cottage. With the application of restoratives he soon recovers, is told of the smuggling operations of Laredo, and in gratitude to Ned, who has rescued him from a watery grave, calls Bonnie, places her hand in that of Ned, and bids them be happy.
