The Hell Cat

 Reporter Dan Collins tries to expose a crooked gambling ring, but is waylaid by Geraldine Sloane, a feisty young heiress who feels Collins has insulted her. To get revenge for the insult, she disguises herself and gets a job at Collins' paper, where she manages to throw his crusade against the gamblers into disarray.
