Rännstensungar

 When her mother dies, the poor and unknown painter Johan Fahlen takes care of Ninni. She is paralysed from below the waist, but Fahlen promises that one day she will be able to walk. While trying to provide for the two of them, Fahlen also has to deal with a custody battle with Malinda Karlsson, who thinks it is an outrage that a painter who can hardly take care of himself is left to take care of a young girl.
