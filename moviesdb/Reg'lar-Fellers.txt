Reg'lar Fellers

 Based on the comic strip by Gene Byrnes, the "Reg'lar Fellers", and one girl-feller, tinker with building a land/water machine, form a kid-band and go on the radio, celebrate a birthday, get involved with gangsters...and reunite a wealthy recluse with her baby granddaughter and estranged daughter-in-law. A group of local kids, who call themselves "The Reg'lar Fellers", invent a machine that they believe can run on land and well as in the water, and also find themselves getting mixed up with gangsters who have framed a local woman's son and have come to town to rob her.
