Star Tours

 Groups of visitors are taken on "Star Tours", a space tour bus set in the Star Wars universe. Thanks to an inexperienced and thoroughly incompetent robot pilot, what is billed as a leisurely tour to the Endor Moon becomes a wild ride as the tour gets caught up in a battle between the Empire and the rebels. Star Wars is now a ride! That's right, a galactical tour company by the name of Star Tours flies tourists to the moon of Endor, which is inhabited by the fun loving, loveable Ewoks. The ship is the fully equipped Star Speeder 3000, and it's piloted by the latest in droid technology Droid, who's about the dimmest star in the galaxy. Well what starts as a peaceful romp soon leads people right into the middle of a dog fight between the Rebels and the Empire; After the ride is over, and REX nearly misses crashing into a fuel freighter, everyone will be wondering, "who in the world gave him a pilot's license?"
