The Jungle

 More than a 150 people are killed in leopard or tiger attacks in India every year due to rampant poaching and encroachment on the wilderness. Such animals have no choice but to invade human habitats and become man-eaters. This story is inspired by one such attack. A couple vacationing in the Indian jungle are disturbed by the arrival of the wife's ex-lover, opening wounds that are best left unhealed; but their troubles have only begun. They are being hunted by a leopard that's turned man-eater and it will stop at nothing to satisfy its hunger.
