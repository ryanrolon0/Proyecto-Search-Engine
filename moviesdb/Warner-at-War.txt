Warner at War

 Documentary centering on how Warner Brothers studios made movies prior to, during and just after World War II; it touches on the history of the four Warner sons, and begins with brief information about some World War I movies' then it quickly goes through the 1920's and into film made during the depression, and focuses on 1939's Confessions of A Nazi Spy. Then, as the government requested, more propagandized films were churned out to life morale during the early days of the war. The documentary finishes up with Pride of the Marines, which helped prepare America for the homecomings of wounded vets, and mentions the ramifications of Mission to Moscow on the Warner Brothers, a film made on request of FDR to help convince Americans that an alliance with the Soviet Union was a good idea.
