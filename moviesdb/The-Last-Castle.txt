The Last Castle

 When three star General Irwin is transferred to a maximum security military prison, its warden, Colonel Winter, can't hide his admiration towards the highly decorated and experienced soldier. Irwin has been stripped of his rank for disobedience in a mission, but not of fame. Colonel Winter, who runs the prison with an iron fist, deeply admires the General, but works with completely different methods in order to keep up discipline. After a short while, Irwin can feel Winter's unjust treatment of the inmates. He decides to teach Winter a lesson by taking over command of the facility and thus depriving him of his smug attitude. When Winter decides to participate in what he still thinks of as a game, it may already be too late to win. Three-star General Irwin, a renowned military tactician, has been court-martialed and sentenced to a maximum security military prison run with an iron fist by its warden, Colonel Winter. Winter can't help but respect the once-legendary general, but that respect turns to hostility as Irwin defiantly confronts the warden on his methods. Their confrontation escalates into war when the general organizes his fellow inmates into an army to take over the prison.
