Stage to Mesa City

 Lash and Fuzzy sent to help John Watson with his stage line arrive to find him murdered. Recognizing the outlaws they trail them to their leader Baxter. But before Baxter can tell who the big boss is he is shot. After getting the stage through to assure the mail contract, Lash now realizes who the boss is. John Watson is in financial difficulties because bandits are repeatedly holding up the coaches on his stage line, and his only hope is to get a mail contract but the bandits have to be stopped. His lawyer, Alan Baxter, tells him that the sheriff refuses to help. U.S. Marshal Cheyenne Davis and his pal Fuzzy Jones are sent to investigate. They arrive just as Watson has been attacked by the bandits, and he dies in Cheyenne's arms after asking him to meet his daughter Margie and son Bob, who are arriving in town with the cash needed to keep the stage line afloat. After Cheyenne and Fuzzy save them from being robbed by the outlaws, Margie and Bob make Cheyenne their business manager. Cheyenne makes the rounds of Mesa City and meets postmaster Tom Padgett, who is paralyzed. Following a failed attempt to get the stage through, Cheyenne begins to suspect Baxter but the latter is killed before Cheyenne can question him. A trap to capture the outlaws fails, but one of them loses a heel from his shoe. Cheyenne goes to see Padgett and notices some mud on the floor. He removes the blanket from around Padgett's legs and discovers that the heel from one of his shoes is missing. Padgett leaps from his chair and attacks Cheynne, but is knocked out and disclosed as the leader of the outlaw gang.
