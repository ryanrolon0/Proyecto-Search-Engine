PuppyDragon Land

 Valandra steals a rocket ship from an aeronautics training facility and pulls it around in her little red wagon. She brings it home, to the delight of Xavier and they proceed to launch it up in the air but not before Valandra tricks Xavier into getting inside the rocket to find her candy so she can launch him up with it.
