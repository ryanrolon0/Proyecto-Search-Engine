Ryan's Daughter

 "Ryan's Daughter" focuses principally on the behind-the-scenes work of the director, David Lean. The story and characters portrayed by Miles, Mitchum, Jones, Mills, McKern and Howard are discussed. Director 'David Lean (I)' (qv) first got notoriety making small, intimate movies, but moved into further acclaim directing larger scoped movies. He is now making a movie that combines both the intimacy of his earlier films with the grandeur of his later films, this film namely _Ryan's Daughter (1970/I)_ (qv), starring 'Sarah Miles (I)' (qv), 'Robert Mitchum' (qv), 'Christopher Jones (I)' (qv), 'John Mills (I)' (qv), 'Leo McKern' (qv) and 'Trevor Howard (I)' (qv). Lean takes elements from all his previous movies for use in this movie. Miles plays Rosy Ryan, a young woman coming of age in Ireland, but whose new sensibilities of a younger woman falling in love with an older man, played by Mitchum, do not mesh with those of society. As with most Lean movies, this movie uses its beautiful setting as another character.
