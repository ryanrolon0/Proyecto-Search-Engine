The Bone Ranger

 Sniffer the dog spies a bone that has just been tossed into the garbage from a restaurant but, before he can get it for himself, a garbage truck comes along and the driver dumps the bone and heads for the city dump. After a few escapades involving the truck and the driver, Sniffer acquires the bone and is about to start gnawing on it when a scrawny, whimpering, hungry little mongrel comes along.
