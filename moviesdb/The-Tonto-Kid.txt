The Tonto Kid

 Lawyer Creech is after the ranch of the dying Cartwright. First he brings in Cahill to pose as the only living relative. Then when the Tonto Kid finds platinum on the ranch, Creech frames him for murder. Crooked lawyer Samuel Creech frames a murder on The Tonto Kid and them enlists the aid of a circus performer, Nancy Cahill, to pose as the missing daughter of cattle-rancher Rance Cartwright. The Kid, aided by young Wesley Fritch and a reformed-Nancy, manages to prove his own innocence while putting an end to Creech's crooked scheme.
