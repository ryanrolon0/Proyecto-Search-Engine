Up in Flames

 The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers are about to get evicted by their landlady. The non fat Freak Brother Fat Freddy goes working for old Mr. Natural, who retains his youth thanks to his marketed vitamins. When two female employees don't manage to sell them, they still provide Mr. Natural with other services before going back to the field. Freak Brother Frank dresses up nicely and successfully seduces his landlady. But after-wards, she says she still expects her rent. A female tenant tries the same trick and at least gets a postponement of some days. Meanwhile, Freak Brother Vinnie fakes being a painter, but his client wants other services anyway. Alas, when she later reveals she tricked him and still wants painting, he steals her purse. Mr. Natural pays Fat Freddy in "vita-beans" after his employees fake being attracted to Freddy when he holds them. Mr. Natural does a personal delivery to the female tenant and agrees to get something else than money. The female tenant then mentions the brothers' situation and Mr. Natural has Fat Freddy spike his "vita-beans" in the landlady's coffee, rendering her sick for a week.
