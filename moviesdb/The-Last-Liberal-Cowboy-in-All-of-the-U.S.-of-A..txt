The Last Liberal Cowboy in All of the U.S. of A.

 Meryn, an urban writer lacking motivation, is visiting a dude ranch in rural Texas in order to find inspiration.

At first glance the situation appears clichEd and embarrassing, but an intimate conversation on the porch at sunset is enough to convince Meryn that even inspiration sometimes requires a second glance.
