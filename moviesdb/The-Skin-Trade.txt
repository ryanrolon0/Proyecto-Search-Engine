The Skin Trade

 When a string of grotesque killings begins to strike her small city, private detective Randi Wade becomes suspicious. A serial killer is taking the skin of its victims and the grisly murders remind her all too much of her own father's death almost twenty years ago. As the police hit a dead end, Randi goes on a search for answers of her own... But when a close friend suddenly becomes a target, he is forced to reveal a startling secret about himself and Randi is quickly pulled into a dark underworld where monsters exist and prey on the living. From the best-selling author of the "Song of Ice and Fire" series comes this chilling story of a killer out for more than blood.
