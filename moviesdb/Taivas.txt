 A story about a young mother, who takes a valuable painting she has inherited from her parents to be appraised at the fine art auction rooms. The art consultant, over a hundred years of age and bearing close resemblance to God, says the painting is just a poster. As the disappointed mother leaves the auction rooms, it starts to rain, and the water washes the paint and colors off the picture.
