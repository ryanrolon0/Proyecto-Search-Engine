The Bombmaker

 An expert IRA bomb-maker turned police informant retires and starts a new life after four school-children are killed by one of her bombs. Ten years later, her daughter is kidnapped and she is forced to construct a massive bomb in the middle of central London, while her husband works with the police and the SAS to locate and free his family.
