Six-Gun Serenade

 When he tries to get feed for a stray calf on credit, Jimmy Wakely gets into a fight with feed-store owner Buck. Jimmy and store hand "Lasses" White, who tries to help Jimmy, are arrested by the sheriff. They join a trio of singers, Lon, Bill and Joe, on the jail work detail, but their singing irritates the sheriff and he sends them to serve out their sentences working for rancher Mary Saunders, over the protests of her foreman Curt Weldon. Cattle rustlers have been killing off Mary's ranch hands, and town banker Martin Kaley is about to foreclose her mortgage. Jimmy and his pals are charged with the crimes, but escape, and with the help of the sheriff, prove that Kaley and Weldon are behind the rustling gang.
