Prey

 The show P.R.E.Y is a satire based on the FOX Television show COPS, which follows actual law enforcement officers in through their daily duties (often chasing criminals and intervening in domestic disputes). P.R.E.Y features members of a fictitious, inept Department of law enforcement officers acting as Vampire Hunters who are sworn to "slay and protect", from the NYPD, which are absent in the show (but for the occasional cameo appearance). In the course of their duties patrolling Manhattan, the officers sometimes address the camera directly as though being interviewed. The show deals heavily in politically-incorrect and 'racy' humor, including many jokes about race, sexual orientation, drug and alcohol abuse, and so on.
