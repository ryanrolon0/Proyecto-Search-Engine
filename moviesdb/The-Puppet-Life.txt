The Puppet Life

 Charlie is a 2 year old little boy with shaggy blonde hair and a sense of curiosity. . . and he's a puppet. In the park, Charlie suddenly discovers he is alone. Now detached from his mother, Charlie sits down to think through his situation. But sitting still is not the forte of a 2 year old, and soon he is checking out his unfamiliar surroundings and making discoveries. But when the wind picks up and rain begins, Charlie can have no comfort but in the arms of his mom.
