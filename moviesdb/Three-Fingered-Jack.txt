Three Fingered Jack

 Three Fingered Jack Doyle, a product of the slums, is by environment, a thief. A companion proposes an enterprise of burglary and Jack consents. But a few moments before he threw away a schooner of beer at the urging of a Salvation Army lassie. The robbery is successful. The following day the Salvation Army girl while on a collection trip visits the office and is accused of the crime through circumstances. He recognizes the imprint of Jack's hand on a blotter. When she is permitted to go she hurries to Jack. She accuses him and he confesses at the same time returning all the money. He has learned to love the woman. She leads him to a church before they go to the home of the victim to make restitution. At her plea the charge of robbery is not pressed and Jack is given a chance to make a man of himself with the aid of the girl.
