Treasure Hunters

 The Stone Mountain Treasure Hunters, a tight-knit and competitive club of metal-detectorists, confront hostile landowners, legal hurdles, and relentless weather as they search for the buried treasure of their dreams. In pursuit of their often ridiculed and misunderstood pastime these hunters unearth lessons about living and relationships as they piece together traces of the past.
