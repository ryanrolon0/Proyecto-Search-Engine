The Man from Lost River

 A beautiful but timid young woman named Marcia comes to a backwoods logging camp, where she is wooed and won by a young city boy, Fosdick. Marcia is put off by the gruffness of the camp's foreman, Barnes, but soon learns that Fosdick is a coward whose sole determination is self-preservation at all costs, and she begins to see that foreman Barnes is the better catch.
