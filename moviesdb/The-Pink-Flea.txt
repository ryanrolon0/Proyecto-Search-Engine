The Pink Flea

 The Pink Panther is bedeviled by a flea that leaves the fur of a dog and takes up residence in the panther's pink coat. Futile efforts by the Pink Panther to rid himself of the flea involve the use of flea repellant spray, hot tabasco sauce, submersion under water, and a razor that de-furs the panther, requiring him to buy a shaggy, fur coat to keep warm from winter's sudden onset - and the flea moves into the fur coat!
