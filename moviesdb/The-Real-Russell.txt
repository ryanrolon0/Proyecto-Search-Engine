The Real Russell

 In the heat of the 1996 Presidential Campaign, film maker Joshua Seftel and author Michael Lewis (Liar's Poker and The New New Thing) were commissioned by CBS News to fashion a report on Bob Dole. Together, the two traveled to Dole's hometown of Russell, Kansas and explored the underside of the small town, sneaking into Bob Dole's garage, eating in downtown Russell's only restaurant ("Home of the Dole Burger"), surveying the future site of the Bob Dole Presidential Library, and being evicted from their strip motel by newswoman Barbara Walter's entourage. The result of Seftel and Lewis' week-long stay in Russell is a dark mini-documentary that gives insight into presidential politics, small town America, television news, and Bob Dole.
