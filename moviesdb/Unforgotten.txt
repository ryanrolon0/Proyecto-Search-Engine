Unforgotten

 Unforgotten is a tale of heartache and a celebration of love, as it follows the journey of a couple's life through contemporary dance. Key moments in their relationship are poignantly portrayed through dynamic partnering and precise/exacting camera work. This couple sees themselves as forever young, full of energy with their whole lives ahead of them, just as most of us do (or would like to).
