The Sixth

 An ancient darkness ushered back from time has been caught in the middle of a power struggle between organized crime and the enigmatic figure who goes by the name Priest (Tiny Lister Jr.). A young beautiful thief (Alyssa Price) is forced against her father's wishes (Brad Fisher), and must use all of her skills to survive the heist of a mummified hand known in the occult world as The Sixth, an artifact surrounded by mystery, power, and death. One is out to save her father. The other is ambitious to get supreme control of the supernatural powers of The Sixth. A battle that matches the ruthless versus the forces of evil will be tested, as only one person will be able to control the corrupt power of The Sixth.
