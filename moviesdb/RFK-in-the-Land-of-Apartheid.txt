RFK in the Land of Apartheid

 Exploring Robert Kennedy's 1966 visit to South Africa during the height of Apartheid, the film evokes the connections between the American Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Apartheid Movement, using previously unseen archival materials and contemporary interviews in SA and the US, framed by the sights and sounds of SA today.
