The Rift

 A man wakes up in a strange and horrible place where the sun never shines...darkness, painful memories, and despair prevail. He fears the worst...that he has somehow ended up in Hell. But can hope exist, even in a place as dark as this? The Rift is a metaphorical tale about the undeniable pain and suffering in our own world...the lost and abandoned souls who live on earth now...and the idea that one act of love can forever change the course of someone's life.
