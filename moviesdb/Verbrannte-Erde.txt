Verbrannte Erde

 After the vanishing of an old peasant, two people whose lives are linked with the absentee in different ways come to know each other on his abandoned farm. Over one day and one night, his young granddaughter Saskia and his seasonal worker Momo, two figures at a turning point, come to converge across the void and leave together.
