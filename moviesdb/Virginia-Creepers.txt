Virginia Creepers

 Virginia Creepers examines more than 50 years of television horror hosting in the Commonwealth of Virginia as a reflection of a national cultural phenomenon. The film not only documents shows and personalities but also the transformation of local television programming from a breeding ground for homegrown talent and community involvement to its current state as a corporate cookie cutter. It also documents the rise of the internet host, which began with Virginia's Count Gore De Vol. The film allows actors, producers and fans to tell the story, concentrating on the best tales and gags. More than 100 interviews were conducted over 16 months and the film includes recovered video, audio and stills from as far back as 1958.
