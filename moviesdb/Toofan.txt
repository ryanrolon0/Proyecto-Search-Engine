Toofan

 Two brothers (Toofan and Shyam) are separated at birth by their father, a police inspector. One grows up to be a magician, and the other, the legendary Toofan, hero of the poor. His father was falsely accused of stealing millions in gold and Toofan is on a mission to clear his father's name from the police records. Shyam Singh and Gopal Sharma are two close friends in Bombay city. While Gopal drives a auto-rickshaw, Shyam entertains people with his magic tricks. Shyam's path crosses with that of notorious bandit, Vikram Issa, who implicates Shyam in a robbery, leading to his arrest by the police. With Gopal's aid, Shyam vindicates himself and sets upon to apprehend Vikram, and then be on the run from his goons. When Gopal comes to his rescue, he meets with an accident, losing both his arms. Gopal, unable to drive anymore, returns home to his wife, Laxmi, dad, a doctor, and his son, Munna. Daku Zalim Singh and Shaitan Singh raid their village, brutally killing Laxmi and Gopal. When Shyam finds out, he goes to their village to avenge Gopal's death. Upon arrival there, he is mistaken for Toofan, a man who possesses super powers with the blessings of Bhagwan Shri Hanuman. Shyam is now in a quandary as to how he can live up to the reputation, skill and strength of Toofan, while he is only a mere magician, not a fighter. Will Shyam succeed in avenging Gopal's death? Who is Toofan, and why has he disappeared?
