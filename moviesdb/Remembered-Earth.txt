Remembered Earth

 New Mexico's high desert is a captivating land of hallowed mountains, red rock canyons and vast, sere plateaus. In Remembered Earth, filmmaker John Grabowska and Indian author N. Scott Momaday present a vision of hope for humankind's relationship to the natural world by interpreting the myth, beauty and power of a scarred but sacred landscape of the American West. Can we come to see land itself as a community to which we belong?
