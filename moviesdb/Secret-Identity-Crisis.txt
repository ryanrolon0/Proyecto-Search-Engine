Secret Identity Crisis

 SOLAR-MAN is hot stuff as a superhero, but by day he's ROY, a workin' man with a condo and a mortgage. But that alter-ego isn't the only part of his identity that he keeps under wraps. Frustrated by failed efforts to capture the sinister ICE MEISTER, Roy gets out of costume and hits his favorite bar to blow off some steam and get a stiff one. There, he meets WALTER, a lawyer with secrets of his own. After an evening of hard drinking, whose secrets come out, and WHAT WILL THEY REVEAL.
