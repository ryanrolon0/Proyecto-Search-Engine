SST

 Cutlass Aircraft has just completed America's first supersonic jetliner, and a host of celebrities and other important people have booked tickets for the maiden voyage, including former sportscaster Lyle Kingman ('Martin Milner' (qv)) and his ex-wife ('Susan Strasberg' (qv)), CEO Paul Whitley ('Peter Graves (I)' (qv)), a soon-to-be married couple ('John de Lancie' (qv) and 'Season Hubley' (qv)), Cutlass PR man Tim Vernon ('Bert Convy' (qv)) and his girlfriend Angela ('Misty Rowe' (qv)), television reporter Carla Stanley ('Barbara Anderson (I)' (qv)), grounded pilot Hank Fairbanks ('Doug McClure (I)' (qv)), and legendary aircraft designer Willy Basset ('Burgess Meredith' (qv)). Unfortunately the plane's hydraulic system has been sabotaged by a disgruntled Cutlass engineer ('George Maharis' (qv)), and last-minute passenger Dr. Therman ('Brock Peters' (qv)) has brought a deadly strain of influenza aboard. With no working controls at 60,000 feet over the Atlantic, Captain Walsh ('Robert Reed (I)' (qv)), McClure, Meredith, and Cutlass VP Marshall Cole ('Lorne Greene' (qv)), have to find a way to get Maiden One down safely.
