Tijuana After Midnite

 Another in a long line of films directed by Phil Tucker that are just various strippers of the era (based in L.A.) doing their acts in front of a stationary camera with 6th-rate comedians trying to do stolen material between the (semi) strips. No plot, no story line and strictly intended for the back-alley grind-house theatres of the larger USA cities, and stayed available for years in the state rights film exchanges.
