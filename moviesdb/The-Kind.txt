The Kind

 The Kind is a dark absurdest comedy set on a rural Australian estate in the late nineteenth century- home to its wealthy British owner, his three young daughters, servants, and a groundsman named Lucien. The story opens with the two eldest sisters, Cara and Nora, overcome by the boredom and isolation of the property, discussing the logistics of committing suicide, while cruelly taunting their younger sibling, Bessy.
