The Case of the Cockeyed Canary

 Little Audrey, an avid reader of pulp-fiction detective stories, falls asleep and dreams she is in animal-land investigating the murder of Cock Robin. She questions the animals, many of which resemble famous show-business people, and finds out that it was her own pet-canary who shot the arrow, that killed Cock Robin, meant as a valentine. She awakens, and finds her canary it its cage romancing a bird that resembles Cock Robin.
