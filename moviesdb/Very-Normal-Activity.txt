Very Normal Activity

 A couple claims they have been the victims of a supernatural force infesting their home, but as investigator Dr. Contreras probes for the truth, he learns it is not paranormal activity but very normal activity to blame for the strange events, not the least of which is the wife's affair with the muscular Dante. Both wife Danielle and 'psychic' con artist Butterfly continue to lead naive but sweet husband Micah to believe spirits are haunting their house in this hilariously spot-on spoof.
