Thunder in Carolina

 Professional stock car racer Mitch Cooper wrecks his car and hurts his ankle in a brutal smash-up. Mitch takes time off from racing to teach cocky eager beaver kid Les York how to drive well on the track. Mitch also takes a fancy to York's lovely, no-nonsense wife Rene. This leads to York ditching Mitch as his manager so he can race for some evil jerk millionaire who only cares about winning.
