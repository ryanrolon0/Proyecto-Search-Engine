The Americans in the Bulge

 Battlefield guide Ellwood Von Siebold takes us on a tour of the frozen Ardennes Forests to Malmedy, St Vith and Bastogne and shows us how the surprise Nazi plan to encircle and destroy the Allied armies was foiled by the gallant actions of the US forces. Visit the frozen foxholes and fog-shrouded hills where these brave soldiers endured unimaginable conditions, listen to the veterans who fought there and learn how, against all the odds, their heroic efforts pushed the Nazis back behind their Siegfried Line. Ellwood von Siebold uses animated maps, archive and veteran's testimonies to explain what happened during the bloodiest and most costly campaign ever fought by U.S forces.
