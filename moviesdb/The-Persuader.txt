The Persuader

 Oklahoma Territory rancher Mark Bonham is killed for his law-and-order convictions in a community that is terrorized by rancher Bick Justin and his gang of henchmen. Minister Matt Bonham, mark's twin brother, arrives and consoles the widow, Kathryn and son, Toby. The latter has vowed vengeance despite pleadings from his sweetheart, Cora Nicklin. Justin talks Toby out of vengeance and offers him a job, which he takes. This alienates him from the community and his family. On the first Sunday that Matt is to hold a service, Justin enters the church, orders everybody out, and with his henchmen sets to burn the building down.
