Tadpoles

 A gunshot suddenly interrupts a young boy's tranquil day in the woods. Curious, he investigates and stumbles upon a strange pit in a small clearing guarded by an armed soldier. The boy hides, but the puzzling sounds of creaking hinges, crashing planks, and desperate gasps soon draw the boy into the clearing and into a discovery he'll never forget.
