Rebel Fish

 Deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains, just outside of a small, quiet town, lives Willy, an animalistic, southern rebel. One horrible night, Kimberly Mathews, a random girl from the nearby town, wanders too close to Willy's territory. Willy, on impulse, takes her captive and murders her. But Willy made a fateful mistake... now he is messing with forces from beyond the grave.
