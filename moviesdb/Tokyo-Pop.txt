Tokyo Pop

 Young female rock singer is not appreciated by her band, gets postcard from Japan saying "wish you were here". Takes what little money she has including ex-boyfriend's rent money and goes to Tokyo. She has numereous cross-cultural adventures and ends up singing with a Japanese rock group looking for a gaijin gimmick. They get their 15 minutes of fame, and our heroine realizes that she has no future there, and will hold them back if she stays. Everyone lives happily ever after.
