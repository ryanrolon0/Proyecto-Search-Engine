 Justina is a fifteen years old girl who lives with her mother and stepfather in Mexico City. In her sexual-awakening, she starts flirting with the only man in her life, her stepfather, causing the accidental murder of her mother and stepfather. Shocked, she runs away from home, crazy, just dressed with her nightgown. Ivan, a police detective who practices torture as daily routine and is reduced to the rank of street cop, looks for her all night long. Justina gets picked up on the street by two cops; they take her to their headquarters. But instead of helping and rescue the girl, they take advantage of her and rape her. Ivan crosses paths with her and takes the girl to the Police Station. But when asked what happened to her, Justina tells a quite different story. In a very hard and strange way, Ivan and Justina finally find what they've been looking for...
