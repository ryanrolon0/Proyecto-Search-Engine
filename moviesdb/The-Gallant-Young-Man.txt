The Gallant Young Man

 "This gallant young man is taking his best girl out for a row, but in order to get his rowboat he has to walk to the water over a narrow and treacherous plank. The young lady is afraid to venture over the plank, so the young man decided to carry her. He has almost reached the boat when the treacherous plank breaks and precipitates the two into the river."
