 Autumn, 1913 ladies gather at the Hertfordshire estate of Sir Randolph Nettleby. A code of propriety governs all peasants, courtship, shooting, adultery. Lionel Stephens, who is courting Sir Randolph's daughter, gets into a shooting competition with Lord Gilbert Hartlip; Lord Gilbert's wife carries on discreet affairs; a pamphleteer circles the estate calling for no more killing, and Sir Robert's grandson hopes to protect a wild duck he's befriended. A way of life is ending Gilbert's violation of the gentlemen's code suggests internal rot as the real world presses in.
