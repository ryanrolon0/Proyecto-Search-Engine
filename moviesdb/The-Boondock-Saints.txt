The Boondock Saints

 Two Irish brothers accidentally killed mafia thugs. They turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one. Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing. Irish brothers Connor & Murphy McManus live and work in Boston. Feeling that God's will to rid Earth from all human Evil was given to them as a mission, they set out to do their divine deed. A public outcry is never heard, and even FBI agent Paul Smecker, who follows their trace of bloodshed, admits that the boys are doing exactly what he secretly always has wished to happen. Risking their lives for their beliefs of Veritas (truth) and Aequitas (justice), the Boondock Saints are hyped by the public, for they are doing good, which only few dare to admit. After Irish-American brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus cheat death with the Russian mob a day after Saint Patrick's Day, the two decide to voluntarily stay overnight at a police station, where the they receive a message from God to rid Boston of all evil. Connor and Murphy, with the aid of their friend Rocco, set out on numerous campaigns to rid Boston of evil, leaving behind a path of destruction. Meanwhile, FBI Agent Paul Smecker is assigned the task of investigating the aftermath of each mission conducted by the MacManus brothers and Rocco. The more pieces Smecker fits into the puzzle, the more he asks himself arrest the trio, or join them in their mission to destroy evil?
