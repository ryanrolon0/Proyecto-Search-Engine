Tere Bin Laden

 "Tere Bin Laden" is a tongue-in-cheek comedy about an ambitious young news reporter from Pakistan who is desperate to migrate to the US in pursuit of the American dream. His repeated attempts to immigrate are shot down as his visa is always rejected. But when things couldn't look worse he comes across an Osama bin Laden look alike. Ali then hatches a scheme to produce a fake Osama video and sell it to news channels as a breakthrough scoop! Unfortunately there are serious ramifications as the White House gets involved and dispatches a overzealous secret agent on Ali's trail. After being rejected & even deported from legally entering the United States of America, Karachi-based Danka TV News Reporter, Ali Hassan, then faces more humiliation at the hands of his boss, Majeed Khan, when he ham-handles the Chief Minister's speech. He is then assigned to cover a cock-crowing contest in a small village, gets to witness the winner, Noora, who resembles Osama Bin Laden. Not giving up hope of relocating abroad, he contacts Lashkar-E-Amreeka's Jamalbhai, who demands a considerable sum of money for a fake passport. Ali and his cameraman, Gul, then attempt to locate Osama, and upon failing to do so, decide to create a fake video featuring Noora. They partner with a desperate radio host/mimicry artiste; an Arabic-speaking co-worker, Lateef; a make-up artiste, Zoya; and con a naive Noora to face the camera, enhance his looks - and set off a hilarious/perilous chain of events - hoping to raise enough cash to immigrate.
