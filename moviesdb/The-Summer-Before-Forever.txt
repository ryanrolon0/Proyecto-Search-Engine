The Summer Before Forever

 David just graduated from high school, and he needs to make enough money for his college tuition if he is ever going to get out of Brooklyn. All the good summer jobs are taken, but with help from his friend Jerry, David talks his way into waiting tables at an upstate New York hotel. It ain't much money, but it's his only choice. David soon finds true love, sex, betrayal, a mobster and a few cha-chas all set in a beautiful mountain resort during 1964, the last summer of innocence, The Summer Before Forever.
