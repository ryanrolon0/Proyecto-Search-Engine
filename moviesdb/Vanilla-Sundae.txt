Vanilla Sundae

 Jasveer Kohli "Jaz" an 18yr old British Indian teenager from London's Southall is trying to fulfill her dreams one true love in life - singing. There in her imagination she becomes a famous pop star with the stage name "Vanilla Sundae" and in the privacy of the sound proofed studios she sings along to the backing tracks she's downloaded late at night under her bed covers, far away from her father's prying eyes.
