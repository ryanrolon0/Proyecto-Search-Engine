The Mischief of Eli

 Eli Hobbs was the most feared outlaw of the American Wild West. Many lawmen and bounty hunters tried to kill him but each time Eli was the hand that dealt them death. A Pinkerton Detective just as evil as any outlaw finally catches up with Eli in the middle of the desert, or so he thinks.
