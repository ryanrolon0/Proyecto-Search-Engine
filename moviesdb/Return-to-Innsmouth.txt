Return to Innsmouth

 Miskatonic graduate student Robert Olmstead (Ezra Hubbard) stumbles upon the ancient, evil-shrouded town of Innsmouth. The village is not on any maps, and they do not take kindly to strangers. But Robert's different...he's blood. As he learns the town's secret history, he discovers that having the 'taint' of Innsmouth blood is a curse. One that is slowly transforming him into a monstrous, immortal slave beholden to ancient, alien gods. Robert must make the ultimate decision as the past rises up to consume the present and change him...forever.
