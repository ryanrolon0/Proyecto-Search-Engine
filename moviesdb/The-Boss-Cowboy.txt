The Boss Cowboy

 Dick Taylor, ranch foreman, has a mess of trouble on his hands, with an unexpected dual romance on his hands while trying to keep rustlers from stealing all the cattle not tied down. He 'kidnaps' his sweetheart to keep her from taking a train back east, is chased by her father but wins the confidence of both by rounding up the rustling gang. Both ranchers Nolan and Kearns are losing cattle to rustlers. Kearns, who works for Ross, is the leader of the rustlers. Taylor finds a wanted poster and realizes that it is Kearns in disguise. When Taylor catches him, Kerns escapes and Taylor has to start out after him again.
