Scooper Dooper

 Sterling, a self-proclaimed reporter from the sticks, comes to the big city dreaming of getting a reporter's job, but ends up as a file clerk at the newspaper. After three months, of filing clerks, he is ready to quit, but a hot-shot reporter gives him a big tip, which is really a wild-goose chase. But Sterling stumbles into a situation, and by masquerading as a singer, cracks a big case for the police. He is made a full-fledged reporter.
