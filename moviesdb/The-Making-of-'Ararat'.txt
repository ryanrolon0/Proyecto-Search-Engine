The Making of 'Ararat'

 We take a look at the making of Atom Egoyan's film Ararat (2002) in this behind the scenes making-of documentary. Many of the key crew members are interviewed here and explain how the whole process of working on this film was. We also take a bit of a look at how important it was for director Egoyan to make this film.
