Red Sunflowers

 In this Bergman-like psychological drama, a schizophrenic man, Vincent, had an epiphany one day to paint on sunflowers. Due to his psychological past, he's being inspired and manipulated by a mysterious friend, Edward. Vincent had to make a choice to either to paint his masterpiece or get strapped in a straight jacket.
