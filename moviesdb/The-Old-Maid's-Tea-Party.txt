The Old Maid's Tea Party

 Four old maids are seated at a table indulging in their afternoon tea. The usual gossip is taking place. One of the guests evidently thinks it is the last good meal she is ever to indulge in for she is engaged in stowing away cookies and other good things in the bosom of her waist. The hostess discovers the theft and war is declared, and the offending party is quickly dispatched. This picture is especially posed with a view to bringing out facial expressions that are very fine.
