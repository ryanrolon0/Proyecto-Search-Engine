The Abductor

 One man's quest for salvation and resolution from a tormented childhood turns ugly when he abducts three women and attempts to recreate his dead mother from the parts of each of them. The body of one, the eyes of another, and the voice of the third now complete Matthew's dream to silence the demons from within. In this game of cat and mouse, will Matthew succeed in his plan or will Kate, Lisa and Laura survive the fight of their lives? Is this the perfect suicide or the execution of a lifetime?
