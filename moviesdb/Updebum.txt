 Ever get something stuck between your teeth and can't get it out? Take that to the Nth Power and you have Jim Minton's perverse, offbeat documentary short. This shocking piece details a true collection of foreign objects recovered by emergency room physicians from a certain body cavity. Absolutely laughable and totally unbelievable. Don't bring the kids. Call 911.
