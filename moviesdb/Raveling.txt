 Eighty-five year old Eldridge Von Waistcoat sits dejected on his couch, feathers floating about his destroyed apartment. Something seems odd about the motion of the feathers, until we realize that everything is moving in reverse. As the film progresses, Eldridge is revealed to be the source of the devastation - we watch his fit of destructive anger as his destroyed apartment re-forms itself in his hands. All of his possessions and objects of affection transform from rubble back into their original state until the apartment is restored. Only at the close of the film, as Eldridge unfolds a crumpled note, do we learn the reason for his tantrum - a bittersweet, comic twist that explains not only his actions, but all of those feathers as well.
