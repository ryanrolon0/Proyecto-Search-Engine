Sous La Peau

 Imagine yourself an autopsy assistant. Every morning you leave for work, having death waiting for you on your dissecting table. Your patients are empty shells who conceal their cause of death within their bodies, while fluorescent light shimmers on their skin. But know that you're a shell too, filled with emotions and earthly thoughts. Then imagine yourself going home, trying to deal with the everyday complexities of life. Maybe then, you realize even more than other people the importance of life and love, like how to care for a child or a silly dog. You might even yearn to be an ordinary working class hero, with a 'normal' job, but humble as you are, you just cut and stitch that what is left and take that what is needed.
