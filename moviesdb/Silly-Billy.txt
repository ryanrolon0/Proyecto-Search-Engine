Silly Billy

 Billie Burke invites the father of her daughter's fiancEe to her home, mistaking him for the fiancEe. Dismayed at his brusque conduct and bad manners, and the age difference between him and her daughter, Billie decides to marry him herself and save her daughter from him. Before it is over, there is some high-society pie-throwing, and a double wedding.
