Santiago y el monstruo amarillo

 Jeremy is a normal kid. Or as normal as you can be while sharing a room with four zombie brothers and expecting a late summer visit from an evil yellow monster. Along with Vilgosh, a goblin, he must escape the house, his mother (a surprising accomplice of the beast) his undead siblings and the yellow fiendish creature before it's too late.
