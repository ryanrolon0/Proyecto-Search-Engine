Secretary Long and Captain Sigsbee

 "Taken at Washington, in front of the Navy Department, and shows Secretary of the Navy Long and Captain Sigsbee of the ill-fated 'Maine' coming down the steps. As they reach the bottom a waiting attache approaches the Secretary and hands him a letter. In the meantime, Capt. Sigsbee and his friend walk toward the immediate foreground, in earnest conversation. They are quickly joined by the Secretary and the attache. Here they halt and apparently debate some important question. Additional action is lent to the scene by ladies and gentlemen descending the steps. The background is formed by the handsome building of the Navy Department. The figures are full life size, and are excellent portraits of the famous Captain and the Secretary. This picture excites the keenest interest whenever it is shown."
