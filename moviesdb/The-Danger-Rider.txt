The Danger Rider

 Hal Doyle ('Hoot Gibson' (qv)), son of the prison warden, falls in love with a portrait of Mollie Dare ('Eugenia Gilbert' (qv)), who runs a reformatory for ex-convicts where they may work for honest wages. To win the girl he poses as the notorious Tucson Joe ('B. Reeves Eason' (qv)) and goes to the reformatory where his reputation causes the other men to fear him. The real Tucson Joe arrives but does not reveal his identity. He and "Scar" Bailey ('Monte Montague (I)' (qv)) plan to rob Mollie's safe of the payroll money. Joe double-crosses Bailey and is robbing the safe alone, when Hal comes in and is knocked out before he can defend himself. He regains consciousness and pursues Joe. Meanwhile, Mollie comes home and Bailey is there and demands the money. Hal, has caught Joe and sent him back guarded by one of the men, returns to Mollie's and captures Bailey.
