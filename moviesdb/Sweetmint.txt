Sweetmint

 Sweetmint is a story about friendship and love, as Roger and Brett, two best friends, who are about to graduate college. Each meet very different girls, who will change the way they both look at love. Brett meets Ginny, a woman who is married, and 10 years older than him, starting a May-December romance full of lust and confusion. Roger meets a girl who is fresh out of high school, and about to start college. Cautiously unsure about their age difference, but certain that Sadie may be his soul mate, Roger wrestles with his feelings for her. Both Roger and Brett struggle with the ins and outs of their relationships, ultimately making decisions that impact the course of their lives. Sweetmint explores the solid bonds of friendship along side the roller coaster of love.
