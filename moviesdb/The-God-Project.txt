The God Project

 Joshua Holden has visions - nightmares to some. Not sure of their source or meaning, he initiates a search the fruition of which is by no means certain. What occurs at the hands of his research, as well as those around him - not the least of which are 1) two close, but very different, compatriots, and 2) a woman who seems to be a kindred spirit of sorts - is a level of development whose consequences are every bit as serious and far reaching as his seemingly discordant dreams. What messages are being given? What truth underlies the cacophony of voices? One wonders how our Joshua Holden will eventually react to the weight of the unfolding knowledge before him.
