Provo Mass

 Even small towns can have big ideas. In quiet, conservative Provo, Utah, home to LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University, a meager but dedicated group of students try to get their chapter of Critical Mass rolling. Armed with the righteous zeal many picked up during their time as missionaries for the church (and a healthy amount of small town fun-seeking), they look for converts to the cause while only slightly disrupting traffic. Their quixotic quest is a surprising example of dedication to a cause no matter how slight the results.
