Saquu Gogei Iga

 One of the most tragic sagas in U.S. history was the forcible removal of American Indian Tribes from their ancestral homelands. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830 setting the federal policy of removing tribes west to Indian Territory. These removals have come to be known as the Trail of Tears. Sagwu Goge'i Iga (On a Spring Day) is the story one Cherokee family's experience on the day militia soldiers arrived to begin the forced removal of them from their home. Spoken in the Cherokee language, this film captures the clashing of cultures and the devastating effects of federal policy driven by greed.
