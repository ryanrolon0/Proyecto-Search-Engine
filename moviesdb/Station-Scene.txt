Station Scene

 A freight train moves out while a fast passenger arrives at the station. Numerous persons go on board, while others alight. After the train starts and gets under way a typical countryman rushes up and beckons for the train to return, which, it is unnecessary to say, continues on its course. The jay drops his carpet bag and taking a sandwich from his pocket, proceeds to eat it and trudges his way back to the farm. This is a good picture and the windup is funny.
