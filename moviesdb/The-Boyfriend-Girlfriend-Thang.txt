The Boyfriend Girlfriend Thang

 Back in the day before the 'me' generation hit the scene, the prerequisite for deep intimacy was a heartfelt statement of 'I love you.' Today, these words hand their meaning have been reduced to a three-syllable word, A-TEN-TION. A relationship built on attention quickly fades to zero. The Boyfriend Girlfriend Thang takes its audience on a gauntlet of emotion and tells the story between a man and a woman and why some relationships turn out the way they do. From the music videos, radio and television our society is programmed to believe that having a lot of money and sexual partners defines success. The Boyfriend Girlfriend Thang shows what really occurs when bling bling meets reality.
