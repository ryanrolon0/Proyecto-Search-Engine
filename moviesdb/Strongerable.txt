Strongerable

 Lights! Camera! Action Hero! Action actors are always receiving bad news. They have to learn how to do it somewhere. Blythe and Dakota teach a course called "Action Acting for the Acting Actor". Here they teach Brettt Riffle and a collection of other Hollywood hopefuls how to be strong, yet vulnerable while on-screen. Hence, "Strongerable".
