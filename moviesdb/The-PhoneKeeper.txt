The PhoneKeeper

 Meet Valdemar. He lives in an answering machine. Or, more specifically, he lives in Rodney's answering machine. It is his only job. It was his father's before him and his father's fathers before that. Valdemar is content. He knows of the world outside of the answering machine but he does not want to be a part of it. Until, one day, an angel from heaven leaves a message for Rodney. Her name is Sophia and her voice is pure. Valdemar is smitten. It is the aural equivalent of love at first sight...
