Sports Parade

 Most of the ten minutes of the Sports Parade short is devoted to the rise of the glamorous Nancy Chaffee in the world of women's professional tennis, and many of the top-tournament players of the era are seen in action. There is a brief segment-cut to scenes of polo-playing in Argentina, but it quickly returns to U.S. tennis action.
