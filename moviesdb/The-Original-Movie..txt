The Original Movie.

 A look at the filmmaking process in the prehistoric era, inside the Stonehenge Film Company. It seems some things haven't changed much. The process begins with the writer dropping off his script, which the director immediately chops to bits (feeding many of them to his goat). After engaging a cast, he then proceeds to film, using a dinosaur as a camera crane. The censors then have their way with the film (more fodder for the goat). The author finally gets to see his work, but he hardly recognizes it and vents his wrath on the director.
