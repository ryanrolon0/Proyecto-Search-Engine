Street Fighter Zero 3

 New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include another former Final Fight character in Cody (who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game), while Karin and R Mika are also new inclusions. The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. World Tour Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms). Arcade your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter) Versus Practise against a dummy. Entry Mode Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Practise). Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favorite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.
