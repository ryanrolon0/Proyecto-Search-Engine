Sail to Glory

 The beginning of America's Cup competition is brought to life in this 1967 dramatization of the first race off Cowes, England. Designer George Steers produces a radical design based on the pilot schooners of New England and builder W. H. Brown makes Steers' dream become a reality in a fast, sleek yacht named "America." The young, brash New York Yacht Club issues a challenge to the proud British yachtsman, which is accepted. The film shows the exciting race and "America's" victory over a fleet of British yachts to win the trophy that, to this day, bears its name - the America's Cup.
