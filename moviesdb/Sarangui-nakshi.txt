 Introverted Dal-ho falls in love with a woman who works in a music shop but he is too shy to talk to her. Instead, he goes to the shop everyday pretending to buy tapes just to watch her. When she changes jobs, he follows her, repeating the pattern and trying to work up the nerve to disclose his feelings
