Road to Thunder

 The roar of the engine. The feel of the pavement rushing beneath you. The way the world looks when the only thing separating you from the elements is a helmet. Through bad weather, horrific accidents, and wrong turns, 12 bikers journey the roads of the nation from Sacramento to Washington D.C.. Their goal is "Rolling Thunder", a million biker meeting set to carpet bomb the capital for the cause of POW's and MIA's.
