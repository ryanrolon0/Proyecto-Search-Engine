Video Musics

 "Video Musics" is a 20 minute multimedia video opera based on Hungarian Mythology and Folk Tales. The music is performed live with the video projection. It is made up of six individual songs/videos that each tell their own story and also interlock to tell a larger story; a story that draws many parallels to our own times and the doom of capitalism and industrialization. "Video Musics" is a post-modern multi disciplined project that explores hip hop as a narrative form for creating a story that oscillates between an abstract free flowing childlike fairytale comprehension and a more traditional straight forward one. The music draws on a multitude of influences.
