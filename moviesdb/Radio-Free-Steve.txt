Radio Free Steve

 Radio Free Steve is a post-apocalyptic comedy best described as Mad Max meets Smokey and the Bandit about a futurist radio pirate racing across the American Southwest in search of a music video career in "New Los Angeles." Originally shot in 1984 by the film's star, Steve Glenn, RFS sat unfinished until 1999 when acclaimed filmmaker Lars von Biers discovered Glenn's video epic and raised finishing funds.
