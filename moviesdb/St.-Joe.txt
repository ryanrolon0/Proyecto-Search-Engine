St. Joe

 St. Joe is visual dirge for The Bricks, the new deal-era public housing buildings that were at the center of a two-year contentious battle over the right of return for those displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Using only images of the buildings and their demolition, St. Joe conveys the sense of loss that many of the displaced residents felt when their former homes were demolished.
