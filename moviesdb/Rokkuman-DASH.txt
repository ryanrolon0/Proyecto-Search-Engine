Rokkuman DASH

 In a world covered by endless water, a new Megaman is searching high-tech underground ruins for quantum refractors. After crash-landing on the small, beautiful island of Kattelox, Megaman and his partner Roll must defend the island against the attack of the Bonnes, a group of sky pirates, a mysterious race of invincible robots and an equally enigmic automaton bent on destroying the island.
