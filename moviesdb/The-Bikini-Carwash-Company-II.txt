The Bikini Carwash Company II

 The girls from _Bikini Carwash Company, The (1992)_ (qv) are back. Their business has been a success, and a purchase contract has been signed with an international megabusiness. But the company CEO is not playing straight - he wants only the land the carwash locations are sited on - to tear them down and build condos. The girls have only a week to raise $4 million to buy their company back. Lingerie sales over a TV channel is the method of choice, and since the product is demonstrated by the carwash principals, the flesh quotient remains as high as expected.
