Soliloquies from Women in Prison

 Several female inmates take the stage of their prison on a Friday night to courageously share the personal narratives they crafted during a summer workshop offered at the prison by two visiting artists. In front of a packed house the women open up to their peers & share a part of themselves that every person in the world can all to easily relate to.
