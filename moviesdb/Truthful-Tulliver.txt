Truthful Tulliver

 Truthful Tulliver, a newspaperman in the Western town of Glory Hole, comes into conflict with Deacon Doyle, who runs the local saloon. Tulliver runs Doyle out of town, but Doyle returns and tries to kill Tulliver. But Tulliver turns the tables on Doyle and his boss, York Cantrell, and drives both of them out of town. He discovers, however, that the girl he loves, Grace Burton, apparently loves Cantrell, so Tulliver goes after Cantrell for the sake of Grace. What Tulliver doesn't realize though is that it's not Cantrell that Grace loves, it's himself.
