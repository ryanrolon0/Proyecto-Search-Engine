The Last Refuge

 "The Last Refuge" takes you over the formidable peaks of the Brooks Range and into the last wilderness of its kind on the planet, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Through the story of one young woman who ventures there, film captures the quiet beauty and stunning vastness of a region that is for the most part untouched by humans, and offers a firsthand glimpse of what will be lost if drilling is allowed there.
