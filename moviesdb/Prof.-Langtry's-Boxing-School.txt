Prof. Langtry's Boxing School

 This scene opens in a boxing school where a pugilist is seen giving lessons in the manly art. A dyspeptic attempts to learn the mysteries and is quickly floored by the teacher. He leaves in disgust and is followed by a fat individual who arranges for a few lessons. After doffing his street attire, he appears in pugilistic form and spars for a while with the professor. Suddenly he lets loose and wallops his teacher to beat the band. Throwing him on the floor, he jumps on him, and after rolling on the floor together the fat man picks the pugilist up bodily, swings him over his head several times, after which he throws him heavily to the floor. It materializes that our fat friend is the genial "Fatty Langtry," the well-known pugilist. Very funny and very good.
