Von Hasen und Schnitzeln

 After 30 years of being married to her husband Erwin, who only cares about breeding rabbits, Charlotte is lacking warmth and affection - her life is narrowed to working, cooking and watching soap operas. Their life has petered into ritual tedium. An invitation from the daughter sets a flicker of hope for Charlotte to escape her claustrophobic domestic situation. She tries to get Erwin into visiting their newly born grandchild with her, but nothing can arouse his attention, let alone compete with his rabbits.
