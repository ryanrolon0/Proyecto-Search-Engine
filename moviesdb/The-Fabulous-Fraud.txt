The Fabulous Fraud

 The story of Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), the source of the word "mesmerize" and the first to use hypnotism as a way to treat illness. Mesmer arrives in Paris, becomes famous and rich treating the maladies of the idle class using shock treatments. Then, while treating a blind lass, he discovers the potential of hypnotism, and sets aside at least some of his quackery to try to be a legitimate healer. Some of his successful treatments are short lived and more of his patients die than recover, so he is driven from Paris, living out his life as a quiet Swiss physician. We see him, old, in front of his fire, wondering if his life has been for the good.
