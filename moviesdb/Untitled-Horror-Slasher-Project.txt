Untitled Horror Slasher Project

 When a rash of sickening murders and disappearances plague a small suburban town, a young day camp supervisor suspects the recently arrived and utterly creepy mystery killer/slasher is involved. Alexandra puts her own life in jeopardy to uncover the ghastly truth about this demented Willy Wonka/Pied Piper, and save the entire town's children from a bloody massacre.
