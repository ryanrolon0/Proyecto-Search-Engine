The Monkey's Paw

 England, 1936. A storm rages in the night. Tucked safely in a cottage nestled deep within the fog of the Moors, the White family eagerly await the arrival of an old friend just returned from serving with the British Army in India. Sgt. Major Morris. His visit entertains them with tales of his adventures and of the mystical talisman discovered deep in the jungle. The Monkey's Paw. It was cursed by an sinister Fakir to grant its owner three wishes. The White family take possession of the paw and the wishes they ask bring terror and tragedy upon their lives.
