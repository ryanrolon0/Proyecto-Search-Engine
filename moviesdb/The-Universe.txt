The Universe

 A group of renowned cosmologists and astrophysicist are in search of a realistic picture of the universe. Their research and observational discoveries point in a direction diametrically opposed to the predominant Bog Bang theory - this leads to a series of sociological situations that verge on the extreme dogma controls wielded against Copernicus and Galileo in the past; only now against our protagonists of the 21st century. This is a controversial science documentary touching on the nerve of everything astronomers and cosmologist claim they know about the universe today. This film promotes a fringe theory of cosmology which is rejected by the scientific community. It's not that it's suppressed, as Myers suggests, but that it has been reviewed and rejected as fitting the observed facts less completely than the dominant theory (expanding universe or "big bang"), and that it leaves more questions unanswered than it answers. The idea that plasma cosmology proponents are heretics, it's that the mainstream views it as a blind alley which, in repudiating the consensual view, is a waste of scarce research resources. As an introduction to what the very small group of non-standard cosmologists believe it has some merit, but it is not in any way a scholarly treatment of this minor, rejected sub-branch of cosmology. As long as you bring a very large pinch of salt with you, it's interesting enough.
