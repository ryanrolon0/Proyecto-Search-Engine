Vansh

 Justice Krishnakant Dharmadhikari is assigned to Chair an inquiry commission against Mantri Vilasrao Chaudhary. While gathering evidence against the later, he must also deal with family problems - arising out of his bigamous relationship with Tulsi and Rukmani; Tulsi's children, Geeta and Siddharth; Rukmani's son, Inspector Gautam; the hostility displayed by his aging mother against Tulsi and her children. As well as the growing anger and animosity between Gautam and Siddharth - who have only one thing in common - hatred for their father.
