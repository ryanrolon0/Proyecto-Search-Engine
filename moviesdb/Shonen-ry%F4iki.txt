Shonen ryôiki

 A young woman witnesses a brutal murder while standing by a river one morning. Rather than go to the police, she decides to track the killer herself. Her goal is not to turn him in, but rather to interview him and get inside his head in order to satisfy her own cravings. Will she get what she wants, or will the truth be more than she bargained for?
