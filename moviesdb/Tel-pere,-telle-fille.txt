Tel pere, telle fille

 Julie pays a visit to her father in the south of France. He has been amputated and lives alone in a seaside house. Father and daughter don't know how to talk to one another, they approach each other, try to explore, dare come closer, and sometimes acknowledge each other. They share the same desire for women, an ambiguous mutual understanding which is tolerated if kept silent.
