RECLAIMING Their VOICE

 RECLAIMING Their VOICE documents ways in which Native Americans have been disenfranchised over centuries, and are now becoming politically active. We meet Native Americans who are stepping forward and speaking out against injustice in their communities. We learn how Native people in New Mexico are reclaiming their voice through education and action. The film follows two stories in 2004 and the challenges they faced once Laguna voters got to the polls and (2) the Sacred Alliance for Grassroots Equality's (SAGE's) dedicated work to override developer interests in order to preserve sacred petroglyphs.
