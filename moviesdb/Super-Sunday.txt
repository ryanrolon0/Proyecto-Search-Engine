Super Sunday

 For Dave, Reggie, Jake, and Alex, Sundays during football season aren't just another day of the week, their all day celebration, filled with beer, wings, pizza, and any game they can find. But on this Sunday, after watching one of their team's wide receivers drop a sure touchdown pass, and Reggie steps forward to proclaim how much better he is than the pros, that all changes. In his mind, he was a star, with hands like glue. To everyone else, he was "Reggie Stonehands", who couldn't catch a cold in Alaska. Dead set on proving everyone wrong, Reggie sets up a mini game right there in the apartment, where hilarity ensues.
