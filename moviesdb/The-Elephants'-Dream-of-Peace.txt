The Elephants' Dream of Peace

 The story of Drogba and the Elephants' 2005 peace mission. He persuaded the government in 2005 to hold the match between the Elephants and Madagascar in the northern town of BouakE - in the first national football match to be played in the North since the fighting broke out. It brought together not just Ivorian fans across the country but the security forces from both the North and South in a shared outpouring of national pride.
