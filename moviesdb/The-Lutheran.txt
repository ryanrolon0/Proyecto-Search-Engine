The Lutheran

 Minister Eldrid Elston insists he doesn't care any more. With his profanity-laced, booze-fueled sermons, he attacks his community for choosing adultery, fake tans, and scat porn over the Word of God. When five local boys disappear, Eldrid drinks himself wild. In a drunken rage, he "protects" Timmy - one of the few boys not to have vanished - by kidnapping him from a seemingly abusive father. Desperate to avoid being fingered as the "real" kidnapper, Eldrid sets out with Timmy to find the missing boys. Along the way, Eldrid bonds with his young captive and begins to rethink his priorities.
