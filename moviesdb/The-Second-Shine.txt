The Second Shine

 Set in 1955, The Second Shine tells the story of proud and determined Dominic Cavalle, his new job with the Mob, the fiancEe who drove him to it and her hard luck brother Charlie between Dom and his white picket fence. Interweaving this post-war race to keep up with the Joneses, the law and the rent, The Second Shine mambos between space and time to show how fortunes are made, fish become sharks and women stop being ladies.
