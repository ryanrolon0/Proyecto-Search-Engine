The Dog Show-Off

 Little Lulu helps one of her friends to enter his dog in a contest to win a prize and Little Lulu, being Little Lulu, is not going to settle for less than first place. First she has the dog impersonate several varieties of pedigreed dogs, but that does not work. She then has him act as a fox and all the dogs at the show chase him. He circles back and Little Lulu gets the judges to declare him the winner due to lack of competition.
