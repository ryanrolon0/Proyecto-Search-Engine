The Devil's Saddle Legion

 Tal is in a lot of trouble. Seems that his father has been murdered while he was in Montana and they put the blame on him. Also, he has been framed and sentenced to 10 years hard labor for another murder which he did not do. The crooks need convict labor to build the dam so they convict innocent people for a pool of cheap labor. But Karan believes that Tal, using the name Smith J. Brown, could not be a killer. Unknown to her, her step brother, Hub, is part of the gang. In the Indian Territory, 'Red" Frayne ('George Chesebro(I)' (qv)), using convict labor is building a dam across the Red River. To get prisoners, Frayne has Sheriff Duke Gorman ('Ray Bennett (I)' (qv)) picking up any man who looks husky, jailing them on a trumped-up charge, and putting them to work on the dam. Tal Holladay ('Dick Foran' (qv)), using the name of Smith, is charged with murder and given a ten-year sentence. From the other prisoners, he learns that the dam is being built to divert the river and throw his father's ranch into the lawless territory, and he also learns his father has been murdered. Later, with Karen Ordley's ('Anne Nagel' (qv)) unintended help, he and five other prisoners escape and become known as the 'Devil's Saddle Legion.' THe band dedicates its efforts to finding the killer of Tal's father, stop the completion of the dam, and put an end to the lawless element's land-grab scheme.
