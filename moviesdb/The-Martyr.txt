The Martyr

 Northern Ireland, 1923. The assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of England has gone awry and claimed the life of a young girl and her brother. A mysterious priest gives the Irish gunman his last confession. Not only does the priest hold the power of forgiveness, he holds the power of freedom. Freedom has a price. What would you pay?
