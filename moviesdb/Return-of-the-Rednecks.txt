Return of the Rednecks

 (Star Wars Fan Film Spoof) Hank and Jed are a couple of Jedi who decide to move to a galaxy far...far...away to a little backwards planet (Earth!) and try to make ends meet as auto mechanics. Darth Vader with his evil henchmen and some Sith assassins come after them with flashy lightsabers but are met with some comedy twists that will leave viewers laughing through the end of the credits!
