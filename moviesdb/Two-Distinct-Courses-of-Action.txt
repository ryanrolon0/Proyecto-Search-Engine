Two Distinct Courses of Action

 "Two Distinct Courses of Action" examines an increasingly polarized world in which starkly contrasting images in black and white threaten to eclipse all color and nuance. Repeated attempts to launch into the freedom of flight are thwarted by a military mindset. This, in turn, threatens to reduce the world into simplified antagonisms. Language exhibits an uncomfortable independence from the intentions of the speaker, as subtitles detach themselves from the film frame and fly away. The Devil has a featured role, and the paintings of Pieter Bruegel are a recurring theme throughout.
