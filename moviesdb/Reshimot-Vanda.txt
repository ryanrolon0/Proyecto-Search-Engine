Reshimot Vanda

 The moving story of Wanda Sokolowska is revealed for the first time in this film, which recounts her rescue of Jewish children after their parents were sent to Nazi concentration camps during WWII. The film tells the story of the children, many of whom do not remember the names or identity of their parents, who survived thanks to saviors like Wanda and are searching for their roots and identities, fifty years later.
