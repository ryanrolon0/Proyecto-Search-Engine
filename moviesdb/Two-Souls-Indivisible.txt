Two Souls Indivisible

 The unforgettable true story of two American soldiers shot down during the Vietnam War and the heroic bond they formed sharing a cramped cell in a brutal POW camp. Fred Cherry, the first black officer to be captured by the Vietnamese, was severely wounded after the plane he was piloting crashed in North Vietnam. Porter Halyburton, a young navy flier born, raised in the segregated south, was thrown in as Fred's cell-mate, their captors hoping the close quarters would inflame American-bred racial tensions and break both men. Instead, a powerful and heroic bond was created between the two that would sustain them through the war and throughout their lives.
