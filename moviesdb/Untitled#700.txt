Untitled#700

 Untitled#700 is a journey in which the western knowledge and its cognitive body have been put under discussion. Untitled#700 tries to give some light to the darkness of the seekers, men and women, unpretentiously. A long metaphor, a wider perception of things examines the meaning of reality as we know it, highlighting the fact that our cognitive body gives us rules, habits and a general state of mind. Even God's essence is questioned and its nature is compared to an hypothetical and indescribable counterpart of the human-being system. Untitled#700 gets inspiration from the experience and the vision of Carlos Castaneda and represents a tribute to the author and his work. Moreover it is an experimental short movie production and a very independent one.
