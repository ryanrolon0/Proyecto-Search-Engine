The Great Pretender

 In 1938, two producers hire Hollywood star Leslie Grangely (McGregor) to play Bonnie Prince Charlie (also McGregor) in a movie about the 18th century Jacobite Rebellion in Scotland. Soon afterward, a drunk Grangely disappears and the producers are forced to find a replacement. They trick a lookalike extra into playing the role of Bonnie Prince Charlie, "The Great Pretender."
