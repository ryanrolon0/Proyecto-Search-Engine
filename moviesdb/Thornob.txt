Thornob

 Thornob is a young caveman with goals and dreams beyond his time. He was thinking outside of the box, before there were even boxes... or wheels for that matter. One day while trying to start a fire, Thornob gets creative and starts describing a new invention in great detail to his friends, Slabnot and Thagg.
