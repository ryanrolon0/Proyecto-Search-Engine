Schattenzeit

 For many years, Olaf, Mona and Maria have been suffering from severe depressions. The illness has left them without any interest in life. Suffering from suicidal thoughts they seek help and admit themselves to the psychiatric clinic of the CharitE; Berlin. They do not shy away from trying controversial treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ect). Their struggle has been followed for over two years. Incomparably empathetic, the movie allows the viewer to comprehend the true emotions involved in this illness. A film about hope, the abysses of life, and the brutal cruelty of an illness.
