 Jicareros is a group appointed by their own people to provide offerings to gods in far-away places and in order to do, in the temples of their communities, a great variety of ritual feasts. This group of jicareros, headed by the marakate- singers, witch doctors, witches-, stay in their positions during 5-annual-cycles terms. The mythology wirrárika is inherited by the surrounding chant of the marakame (singular for marakate). History, from the world creation and up to these days, is relived throughout the trips and feasts. The past and the future, for the wirrárika, are sensitive to changes due to the actions in present time.
