Riccardo Dalisi - Le regole della libertà

 Riccardo Dalisi discovers a hidden Naples apart from the media noise. As an architect and designer Dalisi faces the great themes of global economy decrease and environment. He brings the project to the people facing the spontaneous design together with the children of the Rione Traiano in Naples, and measures himself with art and crafts. Naples, city of stratified mysteries, reveals itself as a place as magic as the unconscious. Main characters are the others, freedom, human meeting and social relationship where, like in the Middle Age, is still possible to imagine fighting dragons!
