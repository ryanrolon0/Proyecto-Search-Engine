Tom's Death

 If you had the chance to kill a man, how would you do it? Four students have been asked to write out scenes on how they would kill a character, Tom. They have three limitations start depicting Tom on the couch in his living room, and he must die. All scenes begin the same way, but end completely unique from one another.
