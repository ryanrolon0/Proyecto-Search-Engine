The Highest Step in the World, Joe Kittinger & Excelsior

 On August, 16, 1960, Joseph Kittinger stood 102,800 feet above the world and took one small step into history. Many remember the spectacle of a single human falling from the edge of space, but few know why he did it, what was accomplished then and NOW from this single bold step.
