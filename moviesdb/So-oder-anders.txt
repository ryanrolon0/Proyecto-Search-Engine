So oder anders

 An old market in the 15th district of Vienna gets torn down in order to get free space for a condominium. The aggressive process of destruction of a public cityspace with social functions is shown in the film. No nostalgia, just wondering if this market was really valueless... The 15th Vienna District open-air market where other things took place besides shopping. A camera-eye observes its disappearance, the excavator churns up the old shops, and with it unearths their stories.
