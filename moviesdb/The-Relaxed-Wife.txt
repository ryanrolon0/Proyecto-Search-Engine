The Relaxed Wife

 At the end of a hard day of work, a man wants to go home and relax in bed, but he can't due to all the annoying distractions around him. As his wife tries to help him relax, the more tense he becomes thinking about all those things that have made him tense throughout the day. But he sees that his wife, who has also probably had a tense day, is relaxed, and she helps him understand what is causing his tension and tricks she uses to feel more relaxed in tense situations. But these don't always work, at which time one might resort to using an ataraxic, or tranquillizer.
