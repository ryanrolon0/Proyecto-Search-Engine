Spyder

 A portrait of a young woman with a vagabond soul. She experiences various levels of reality, between heaven and hell, ecstasy and horror, discovering the world of cinema and her first love. With 'Spyder' Ishibashi joins the handful of film makers who realized an entire feature film with footage exclusively shot with the mobile phone.
