The Misadventures of a Claim Agent

 When Jack Neivell found the evidence of pay dirt while prospecting he decided at once to purchase the claim lease from the owner. He called at the office of the landman and by turning over his savings obtained the leases from the owner. Jack pitched his camp on his claim and started to work. He soon made a respectable showing. It happened that Dad Curtis, the land owner, was also enamoured of Tess Williams and he called to pay his respects and urge her to become Mrs. Curtis, on the morning that Jack struck a pay streak. In his excitement Jack hurried to Tess's home to tell her of his success and incidentally hers if she so willed. Tess so willed--and poor old Dad returned home to cook a scheme to neutralize Jack's success. He payed a visit to Jack's camp and secured the lease that the young prospector had carelessly left, and employed a bunch of squatters to work the claim for him. When Jack returned from his successful wooing, he was ordered off his claim by the squatters unless he could show his lease, and as it was resting in the inside pocket of Dad Curtis, poor Jack was compelled to return to Tess empty-handed. Tess did some rapid thinking and then some rapid work.
