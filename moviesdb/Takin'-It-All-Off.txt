Takin' It All Off

 A school for strippers is in financial trouble. They audition for The Big Strip Joint Owner, and he's pleased, except that the new girl can't make herself take her clothes off. After hypnosis, she's ready, willing, and able, but always strips when she hears the Big Theme Song, and threatens the future of the strip school when she wants to become unhypnotized.
