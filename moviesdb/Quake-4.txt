Quake 4

 During the bloody war between humans and the nightmarish race of the Strogg, a lone marine infiltrated the planet and assassinated their horrific leader. The humans discover that the Strogg are not so easily defeated, however, and that their only hope may rest on a marine that is no longer entirely human.
