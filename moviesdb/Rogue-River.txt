Rogue River

 The story of two step-brothers, raised by their father, the chief of police, in a small Oregon lumber town. One brother is hard-working, always within the law, the other a 'rogue.' When gold dust comes up missing from a crime scene, brother is pitted against brother and the father sides against one of the brothers.
