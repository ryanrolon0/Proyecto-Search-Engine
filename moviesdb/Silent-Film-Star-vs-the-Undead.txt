Silent Film Star vs the Undead

 A classic film from 1929 considered to be lost for all time, 'Silent Film Star vs The Undead' is the story of one remaining Star at the dusk of the silent film era as he attempts to rescue his true love from the evil clutches of Victor and an army of the Undead. Presented in brilliant black and white, this film highlights the slapstick comedy that made Charlie Chaplin a household name and gruesome horror of films such as 'Nosferatu' and 'The Golem.'
