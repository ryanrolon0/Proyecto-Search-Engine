USS Liberty Survivors

 "USS Liberty Survivors person accounts of the events of June 8, 1967 as experienced by the officers and men of the USS Liberty. This could be the only story of the assault on the Liberty which is not colored by propaganda. The attack on the USS Liberty was carried out by various kinds of of aircraft and torpedo boats and continued for a period of over two hours. American casualties were tallied at 54 killed and 171 wounded. The USS Liberty took over 800 machine gun, rocket, and torpedo hits and refused to sink, and so her life rafts were machine-gunned by the torpedo boats. Israeli helicopters loaded with assault troops circled overhead as the order "Stand By To Repel Boarders!" was heard on an American ship for the first time since the days of John Paul Jones. An extensive cover up of the details of the attack on the USS Liberty was put into place. The actual story was erased from history and has not been told on film or video -- until this documentary.
