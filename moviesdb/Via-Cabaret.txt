Via Cabaret

 Harry Reeder was a steady visitor at the cabaret and he visited with a single thought in mind - pretty Vail, the singer. Harry discussed marriage with his father but the aristocrat said no. So Harry did what every other American young man does under the circumstances - marries the girl. They tried to keep it secret, but Harry's dear friend, Bert, who in secret loved the girl, took plans to let Reeder know of it. Thus the young couple were driven from the parental roof and took a small, cheap bungalow. After that Bob wouldn't let her work - he took the violin and secured her place at the cabaret. Bert often went there and exulted in secret. But if Bert had done nothing more serious than exult in secret, everything would have gone well, but Bert insisted in seeing Vail and times his visits so as to be found by Harry. One day Bert, refused admission by Vail, pinned a note to the door-post, intimating that she intended to elope with him that afternoon. At the same time the heart of the old man Reeder relented and he started toward the little bungalow. Thus Harry coming home found the note a minute after, captured Bert and trounced him soundly. The father, witnessing the incident, found no further enmity in his heart toward the young couple and took them home with him to better things.
