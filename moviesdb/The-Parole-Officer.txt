The Parole Officer

 Failed parole officer Steve Garden (Coogan) is framed for a murder committed by one of Manchester's leading police constables. The only evidence proving his innocence is a CCTV video tape locked inside a bank vault. With the help of four inept ex-criminals and token love interest Emma (Lena Headey), Garden must break into the bank and steal the CCTV footage in order to clear his name.
