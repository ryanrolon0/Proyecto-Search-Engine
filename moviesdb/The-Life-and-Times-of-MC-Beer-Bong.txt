The Life and Times of MC Beer Bong

 MC Beer Bong is the world's first Asian-American rap superstar ever. Making more girls wet than an erect Pho noodle, MCBB turns the music world upside down with his phat rhymes and ill beats, and still finds time to pursue his favorite hobby of all - drinking beer out of a beer bong. When it's discovered that MCBB doesn't know Kung-Fu, he's replaced by someone more "Asian." His 15 minutes of fame spent, he returns to work as a video store clerk, and to a family and friends jaded by his success.
