Surviving History

 This documentary traces the journey of the researcher, Shivaun Woolfson, in her quest to collect and collate the living imprints of the Jewish presence in Lithuania. It begins with a poignant reflection on her findings at Ponar, the largest mass killing site in Lithuania. The audience is then transported into the living rooms of seven narrators, introduced to their stories, their memories and their current worlds. They are then led on a journey to the cemeteries, to the last remaining synagogue on Pylimo Street, and to the memorial sites commemorating those who perished in the Lithuanian Shoah. This documentary explores the complex and layered history of the Jewish experience in Lithuania including issues of local complicity and collaboration.
