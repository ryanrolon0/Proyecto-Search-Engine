Ringo Rama

 An intimate look at the making of Ringo Starr's latest album, Ringo Rama. This documentary gives you the feeling of what it's like to hang out with Ringo in the studio, mainly because a large portion of it was shot by his band The Roundheads, along with director Brent Carpenter. It's fascinating to watch the formation of the songs and the parade of guest stars and friends, including Eric Clapton (who guests on the George Harrison tribute "Never Without You"), Willie Nelson, David Gilmour, Shawn Colvin and Timothy B. Schmit to name but a few. Ringo has never looked so good or appeared so charming! Currently only available as a bonus with the new CD Ringo Rama
