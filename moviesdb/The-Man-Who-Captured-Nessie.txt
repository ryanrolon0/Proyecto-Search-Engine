The Man Who Captured Nessie

 In the 1970's the British tabloids and indeed the world was set alight by the most convincing pictures of the Loch Ness Monster ever taken. All the shots were taken by photographer Frank Searle and they brought him as much fame as they did to the monster. However the scientific community were doubtful to say the least - even those who were also looking for the monster were less than complimentary about Searle and his work. In 1984, against a background of violence, threats and intrigue, Frank Searle simply disappeared and was never heard from again. Director Andrew Tullis travels to Loch Ness to try and understand the enigma of Frank Searle.
