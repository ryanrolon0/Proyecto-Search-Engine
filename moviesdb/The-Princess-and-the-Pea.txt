The Princess and the Pea

 The Princess and the Pea follows the search of a small country family (the very large & robust Mama Pat and the thin & wise Papa Joe) to find a wife for their son (the hunky, but simple Billy Boy). Set in a Dr. Seuss-like realm of otherworldly landscapes near the end of the 19th century, these odd characters promise wealth to any princess who will marry their son. Princess Vee arrives, much to the suspicion of Mama and the disdain of Billy who doesn't want a "real princess," but a "real girl" to fall in love with. In homage to the classic fairytale, Mama devises a plan to test the Princess. In the process, the family discovers that Princess Vee is not a royal princess, but is something more unique. Futhermore, the wealth that the family offers is not money, but love and friendship. In the end, Billy Boy and Princess Vee ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after. Wanted beloved fairytale retold in the Old West peas, a cowboy, and a bed - dozens of mattresses high - towering over the desert. Will this cowboy get his gal, or be stuck with a stuffy princess? The Princess and the Pea is classic family entertainment for the giant screen. In a fantastical world not quite like our own, colorful characters live and rhyme in their own unique reality.
