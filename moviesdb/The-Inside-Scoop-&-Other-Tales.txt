The Inside Scoop & Other Tales

 Two bondage tales, plus one vignette in this Harmony Concepts anthology. In the first story, an unethical reporter tries to get the goods on a bondage movie producer. In the second yarn, a police officer responding to an accidental 911 call stumbles onto a art theft ring and is soon tied and gagged while the villains try to make their escape.
