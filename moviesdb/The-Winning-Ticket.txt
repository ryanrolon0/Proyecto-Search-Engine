The Winning Ticket

 John Silver's ship has been repossessed; the Captain and the Kids have won $100,000 in a lottery. Silver dresses as an old lady and pretends to faint on the Captain's porch. He is taken inside and soon finds the winning ticket. Meanwhile, the kids spotted him outside and dress themselves as a young lady and come on to Silver, eventually handcuffing him to a batch of fireworks.
