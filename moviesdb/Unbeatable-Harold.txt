Unbeatable Harold

 In the Biggest Little City in the World, Reno Nevada, lives a lovable loser, Harold James Clark. He's reaching for the stars while he searches for love and hopes to live his dream of becoming full time manager at the Wagontrain Steakhouse. Harold's assistant manager status already leaves him feeling lucky. Harold looks at a half filled glass and is simply amazed that there is even a glass. This Elvis wannabe finally meets his dream girl, Wanda Livingston. She's just run away from Vegas and her 80's rocker boyfriend, Jake Salamander. Never-mind her lack of waitressing skills, Harold gets her a job at the Wagontrain anyhow, and shows her the ropes. When Jake shows up in Reno Wanda decides to give him another chance. Meanwhile, Harold and Wanda become close real fast. Too close for Wanda. Not close enough for Harold. He's in Love... And ready to pop the question.
