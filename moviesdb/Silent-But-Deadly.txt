Silent But Deadly

 George Lucas decides he's had enough of the plot-revealing antics of the fan websites, so he sends out two of his top enforcers to handle the situation. They receive a list with three names on it and head out to do their job. They arrive at each webmaster's home in various, humorous ways and abduct each one. They later find themselves at an undisclosed location, tied and bound, and are submitted to the most horrible torture a STAR WARS fan could ever dream of...Needless to say, these three won't be logging back on any time soon. Lucas' plan has succeeded, but who's next on his list?
