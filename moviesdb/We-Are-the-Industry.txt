We Are the Industry

 'Dani & Izabella are on a mission of revenge for the brutal death of Dani's brother. Josh is a seemingly ordinary guy with an average life, that gets caught in a situation, in over his head. The Businessman, a small-time gangster with a big secret. Each has their own story & we follow them as they hurtle headlong into each others' paths, where people will die, drug deals are botched, hallucinations become reality & each winding road is never as it seems'.
