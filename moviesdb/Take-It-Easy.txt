Take It Easy

 Two teenage boys from St. Louis, who have just finished high school, decide to take a road trip to Winslow, Arizona to present to the town a statue of Don Henley which one of the two has constructed. But the sculptor is a poor artist at best, and the statue, which everybody they meet takes to be someone other than Mr. Henley, is damaged several times throughout the ill-fated trip, causing the boys to re-evaluate their friendship and their future.
