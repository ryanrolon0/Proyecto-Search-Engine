This Choir of Angels.

 This Choir Of Angels is a poetic look at human guilt and the conscience that walks with our every step. These haunting angels are contemporary and urban tormenting our drunken New York everyman until one day he takes a stand. With the backdrop of a bohemian New York and the artistic vision of a unique neo-expressionist, it has the aesthetic qualities of George Grosz in a particularly drunk and angry mood.
