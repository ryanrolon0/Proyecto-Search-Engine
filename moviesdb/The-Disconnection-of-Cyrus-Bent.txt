The Disconnection of Cyrus Bent

 A heavy, neurotic man in his early thirties, Cyrus Bent is wound too tight. His wife, a woman who is grumpy at the best of times, pressures Cyrus into getting a vasectomy. Finally, under duress he concedes to undergo the 'terrifying' procedure, propelling him into the most challenging experience of his life where he is forced to face his fears head on. When Cyrus arrives at the vasectomy clinic, things are worse than he could have possibly imagined characters in the waiting room, a fearsome nurse and a womanizing, laissez-faire vasectomy doctor more interested in his assistant than Cyrus' testicles. Cyrus Bent's life is about to change...in more ways than two. This could get nutty.
