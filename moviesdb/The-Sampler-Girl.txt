The Sampler Girl

 Darla Dorr (Sophia Gilberto) works at Bahls' Cafe as a sampler girl who serves wacky new drinks the owner, Harry, creates. Darla spends most of her time dreaming of the owner's son - Casey (Brandon McCluskey). When a co-worker, Melanie (Alexandra Petrova-Emisti), learns that Darla is in love with Casey, Darla becomes a target of Melanie and her friend.
