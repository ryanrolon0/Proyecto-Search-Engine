We Are All Cylons

 We Are All Cylons is a visionary take on the profoundly resonant series Battlestar Galactica. Through interviews with cast members and fans, the film explores the areas where science fiction meets reality. Actors describe the challenges they faced playing characters that discover they're not human, and fans explain their deep emotional and intellectual connections to the program. Issues such as rapidly advancing technology, the malleability of identity, and the role and representation of the military in contemporary life are examined. Tethered to reality while at times blurring the line between documentary and science fiction, We Are All Cylons examines the complex relationship between viewers and Battlestar Galactica's depiction of artificial intelligence, consciousness, notions of the divine and what makes us human in the digital age.
