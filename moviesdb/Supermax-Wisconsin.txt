Supermax Wisconsin

 SUPERMAX WISCONSIN chronicles the new high tech Supermaximum Security Prison in Boscobel, Wisconsin. Recognized by Amnesty International and the ACLU as having some of the worst violations of human rights for a prison, Boscobel Supermax was spawned by the political ambitions of Tommy Thompson, rising prison populations, and local economic development proponent. In "Supermax Wisconsin" we explore its conditions, its history, and finally, its ramifications on the prisoners themselves.
