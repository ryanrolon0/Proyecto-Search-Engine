The Eyes of Scott Robbins

 Scott Robbins makes history shows for television. But when he finds out he's got cancer and six months to live, he turns the cameras on himself. With the help of his video technician friend Cat McCoy, he rigs a small camera on the side of his glasses and films the world literally through his eyes. Scott pulls back the curtain on the mysterious and intimidating world of cancer treatment. But he films more than just his surgery, chemotherapy and radiation... Coworkers, family, friends - nobody is safe from the Eyes of Scott Robbins.
