The Quiet Earth

 A man wakes up to find himself literally alone in the world, and goes about trying to find other survivors, as well as to find out what happened. He suspects that a government research project he was involved in had something to do with the disappearance of everyone. Eventually he finds several other people, and once they begin to trust each other they try to figure out why they were left on earth. Zac Hobson wakes up to find that he is apparently the only person left on Earth. Soon, however, he meets others - Joanne, a pretty young woman, and Api, a huge Maori tribesman. They survived the apocalypse (a malfunction of a government project in which Zac was involved) because all three were at the moment of death--Zac's attempted suicide, Joanne's exploding hair dryer, Api fighting with another man--when the apocalypse occurred. Soon, however, Zac and Api begin fighting over Joanne, and the trouble begins...
