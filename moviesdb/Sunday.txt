Sunday

 The story of 15-year-old Sunday. There isn't a part of Sunday's life that hasn't been affected by the conflict in northern Uganda. Orphaned at a young age, he lives in a displacement camp and struggles to survive amid the effects of poverty, disease, and malnutrition. With no family left to depend on, he must try and provide for himself. Without enough time to work and go to class, Sunday can't make the money needed to pay for school fees and is asked to leave class. The war has already taken so much from him now threatens to take the most valuable thing he has left that has been marked by tragedy is defined by resilience, and despite reasons to lose hope, Sunday perseveres. This is the story of faith that overcomes suffering.
