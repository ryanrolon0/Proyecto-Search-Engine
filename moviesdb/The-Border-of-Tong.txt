The Border of Tong

 The dark alleys and winding streets of Chinatown are forbidden places for newcomers. For years the residents sought refuge in local gambling parlors run by TONGS rival gangs fighting amongst themselves. Tong lived on the edge of two worlds where their own social and legal code establishes their border. Anyone who crosses may never return.
