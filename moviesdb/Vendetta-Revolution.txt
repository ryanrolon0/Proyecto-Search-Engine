Vendetta Revolution

 After making some of the most viewed movies of all-time online, Fox took a talented group of friends and gave them the opportunity to shoot their own TV show in the small town of Washington, Michigan. With the guidance of veteran TV Writers and Producers Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland (King of the Hill) & Todd Yasui (Craig Ferguson) the team crafted a pop culture mash-up that connected the internet with television like never seen before.
