Wagon Wheels

 The trio of Belmet, Burch, and O'Meary are leading a wagon train west and Murdock is out to stop them. The settlers fight off his initial Indian attack and reach the mountains. With the wagon train vulnerable as it crosses a river, Murdock has the Indians make a final attack. Three veteran scouts, Clint Belmet, Jim Burch and Bill OLeary, are leading a wagon train of settlers to the Oregon Territory. Fearing that an influx of settlers and merchants-to-follow would tear down his empire of fur-trading and exploitation of the Indians, Murdock has his henchmen pose as Indians in an effort to halt the western expansion.
