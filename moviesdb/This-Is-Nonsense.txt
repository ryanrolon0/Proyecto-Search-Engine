This Is Nonsense

 This Is Nonsense A gothic lolita. A poison peddler. A mentally unstable telemarketer. And a group of censors who would rather put "Technical Difficulties" on the screen than bleep something out. What do you get when you mix all this together? The most hilarious, unexpected comedy sketch show known to humankind following the "stream-of-consciousness" approach popularized by Monty Python's Flying Circus and the Royal Canadian Air Farce, This Is Nonsense is a hilarious, irreverent, and completely random brand of humour for a new generation.
