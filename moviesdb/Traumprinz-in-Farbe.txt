Traumprinz in Farbe

 Pretty blond Clara Arnold works for a newspaper in picturesque Lüneburg, just outside Hamburg in northern Germany. Being single, she firmly believes that some day she will meet the man of her dreams. She shares her flat with her rather chaotic sister Meike, chronically broke, who is trying to fix her up with Leonard, a good-looking and successful young man, who has been pursuing Clara for quite some time. But then Clara picks up the wrong pictures at the photo shop and falls head over heels in love with the handsome stranger on the pictures. It is Ben Ivaldi, a furniture designer - but it takes Clara some time and several approaches to get to know him. Further complications arise when Clara's boss, a rather unpleasant lady from the big city, also falls for Ben, and Ben's former girlfriend Lena, who dumped him for a job in Italy, returns to claim him back.
