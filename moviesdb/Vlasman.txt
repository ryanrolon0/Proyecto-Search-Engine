 Two old brothers are trying to get rich growing flax. They are hard and hardworking men, living in post-industrial Flanders-Belgium as if time stood still. While the brothers ignore the changing world around them, their rural village transforms and suburbia closes them in. And there is more environmental licensees. But those days are gone. The local authorities want to shut down the flax mill and their habitat is in danger of being destroyed. Everything is about to change. Will the flax men adapt or disappear?
