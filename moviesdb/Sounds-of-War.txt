Sounds of War

 Sounds of War is a documentary feature that was shot during the second Lebanon War in 2006. It follows a group of internationally acclaimed conductors who traveled to Israel for a month long workshop for young classical musicians from around the world. It's an annual event that takes place in Keshet Eilon, a kibbutz on the border of Lebanon. In 2006 the sound of violin concertos was suddenly muffled by the sounds of Kassam Missiles - the 2nd Lebanon war broke out... the story of music, classical art and war.
