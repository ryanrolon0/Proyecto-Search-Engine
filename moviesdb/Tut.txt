Tut

 Priceless artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun filmed while on display at The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. during the North American Exhibition in 1977. Orson Wells hosts this documentary providing such vivid description of the treasures, one can see them even without looking! "The detail of many the treasures are revealed with far better definition than if seen in person," as stated by Orson Welles.
