Porky the Giant Killer

 Porky Pig is tapped for a giant-killing expedition. When the expedition reaches the giant's castle (which is normal sized, requiring the giant to stoop), everyone but Porky runs at the first sign of trouble, leaving Porky alone to awaken the giant's sleeping baby. Porky then must soothe the baby back to sleep and attempt his escape.
