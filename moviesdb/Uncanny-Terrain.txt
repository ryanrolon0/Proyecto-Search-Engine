Uncanny Terrain

 The first sprouts are beginning to emerge on Colors of the Seasons Farm, 45 miles from the malfunctioning Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant and 20 miles outside the evacuation zone. 28-year-old Masanori Yoshida left his job as a cook at a French restaurant in Tokyo three years ago to work his family's land with his wife, siblings, parents, and grandmother. They grow natural crops including 'firefly rice,' so named because the insects, driven near extinction by chemical pesticides and fertilizer, have proliferated as farmers return to the traditional methods practiced by their ancestors. The Yoshidas' farm is one of hundreds of organic farms in Tohoku, the earthquake and tsunami-ravaged region of northern Japan that supplies much of the rice and vegetables to Tokyo and across the country. Government warnings have limited the sale of food grown there since high levels of radiation were detected in some spinach, milk and fish from the region. "We don't know if our crops will be safe," Masanori says. "We can't ignore this issue. But we won't stop cultivating our land. We farmers need to nurture the environment, nature and culture, and pass them to them to the next generation."
