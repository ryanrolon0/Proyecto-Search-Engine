Terra Nova

 A disturbed young woman (Jeanette Cronin) runs away from her New Zealand home and hides away in an Australian boarding house, named Terra Nova. There she finds that every one else in the boarding house is just as zany as she is, and on some levels make her seem sane despite the voices in her head and her strange visions.
