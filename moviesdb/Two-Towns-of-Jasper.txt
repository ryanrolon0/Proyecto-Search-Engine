Two Towns of Jasper

 Using two separate filmmaking teams (an all-white crew filming white residents and an all-black camera crew filming black residents), Two Towns of Jasper captures very different racial views by townsfolk in Jasper, Texas, the location for a racially motivated murder of an African American in 1998.
