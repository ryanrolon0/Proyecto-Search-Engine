The Sound of Hitchcock

 The cry of gulls. The ticking of a clock. The clatter of a shower curtain, torn from its rod. In this workshop-like documentary, Academy Award-winning sound designers invite you to join them at their mix boards to investigate how Alfred Hitchcock employed sound design to tell his cinematic stories, whether making audience members leap from their seats in fright or crawl under them from excruciating suspense.
