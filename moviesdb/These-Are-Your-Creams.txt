These Are Your Creams

 The National Pub Quiz finals are being held in a village on the Norfolk broads, with a prize of £10,000. The teams include These Are Your Creams, whose knowledge of trivia is superb. However, Brian the quiz master has fixed the contest, giving the answers to another contestant, Raymond. A further team has a radio link to an accomplice in a van, who will look up answers on the internet. These Are Your Creams discover Brian's shenanigans, and steal Raymond's answers. When Raymond fails to make it to the final, Brian, who mistakenly believes the van belongs to Raymond, orders its torching, inadvertently thwarting the other cheats. These Are Your Creams win the quiz. But Brian is not prepared to give up the money so easily.
