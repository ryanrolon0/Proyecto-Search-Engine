Rats - Notte di terrore

 One hundred years after a nuclear war has devastated the planet, society has been reborn into two factions; the underground society and the scavangers above in the wastelands. A group of scavangers on bikes come accross a town infested with flesh eating rats, and soon the gore is spilling everywhere! In the year 2230, 215 years after a nuclear war destroyed the surface of the world, a group of 11 nomatic motorcyclist scavangers arrive in a deserted town searching for food and water, when they are set upon by thousands of flesh-eating, mutant rats. Armed with various assault weapons, flame-throwers, and other sharp objects, the group must co-operate with each other to fight the increasing number of murderous rodents in order to survive the long night.
