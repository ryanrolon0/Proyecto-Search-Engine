The Undertaker

 10-year-old Victor Morgan dreams of becoming a funeral director when he grows up. He approaches the town undertaker, Daniel Kauffman, for an apprenticeship, but is rejected. When a notorious Russian mobster appears, Daniel is forced to take an offer he can't refuse. Luckily Victor has an idea that may keep the nails out of Daniel's coffin.
