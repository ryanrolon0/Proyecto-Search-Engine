Turkey Day

 It's a cold day before Thanksgiving. Joseph, an aging homeless man, is given a big frozen turkey, by a well-intentioned woman, embarrassed by her own guilty conscience. Now, with little more than a howling stomach, Joseph sets out on a desperate journey to get to eat the turkey. His often-comedic odyssey leads him across the city, experiencing along the way the many different attitudes toward the homeless. Challenged by a loss of Hope, he ultimately finds his hunger satisfied in the courage of Giving.
