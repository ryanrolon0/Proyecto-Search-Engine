View of State Street

 Showing as it does, this famous thoroughfare, as viewed from a street car, on a bright, warm, sunny day. This picture takes in both sides of the street and shows the throng going and coming. The people crossing the streets, the various sky-scrapers, teams, the immense stores, the elevated railroad and the famous dead man's curve corner State and Madison streets. This is indeed a fine picture and shows State street from Harrison to Madison, a distance of six blocks.
