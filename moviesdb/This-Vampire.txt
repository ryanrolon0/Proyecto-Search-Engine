This Vampire

 A director's female lead from his most recent film is mistakenly interpreted as a portrayal of his jealous ex-girlfriend, due to several parallels, and the lives of the director and his actress are put in jeopardy (from the ex-girlfriend) as they are working on a new project adaptation of Mary Shelley's short book, Matilda. The previous film story about androids in the 22nd century. All the stories begin to meld together.
