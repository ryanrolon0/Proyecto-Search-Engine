The Observers

 The land and sky of Mt. Washington, New Hampshire form a frame in 'The Observers' for two climatologists as they go about the solitary and steadfast work of measuring and recording the weather. Based in part on the Nathaniel Hawthorne story 'The Great Carbuncle,' this film features the extreme and varying beauty of the windiest mountain in the world.
