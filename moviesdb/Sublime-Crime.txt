Sublime Crime

 Spinster Matilda falls for her gold digging butler, only to discover him making love with equally gold digging young Trixie. Somebody's going to get murdered. But they're going to do it off screen, because Sublime Crime is entirely subliminal, with only flashes of the plot spaced between a blank screen and flashes of positive affirmations. All of which will make sense when the viewer sleeps through the movie and wakes up with enhanced self-confidence and the happy memory of a movie...or was it a dream...they really, really liked.
