Shoebox Heroes

 "Shoebox Heroes" is the tale of young Frank from Bedford, Virginia. In 1942, his older brother, Chuck, heads out to the European front to fight. But before he leaves, Chuck gives his little brother a comic all about war called "Sergeant Cutter." Frank loves it, imagining Sergeant Cutter and Chuck as one, killing German soldiers and being the glorious hero in the pages of his comic. But can Frank maintain his virtuous vision of war the longer his brother fights overseas?
