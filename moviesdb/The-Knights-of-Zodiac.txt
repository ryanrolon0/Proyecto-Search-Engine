The Knights of Zodiac

 Scorpio, Gemini, and Libra journey into the lair of a ferocious beast in order to save the last virgin on the island...or so they think. When they all see their destiny in a daily newspaper, each of them believes they are the one to rescue the girl. The only thing standing in their way is the beast itself...if you don't count Satan.
