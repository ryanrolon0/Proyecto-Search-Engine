The Adventures of George the Projectionist

 George is watching the screen entranced. He is 58, single, and a projectionist. He is in love with Stefania, the beautiful Italian actress he sees every night on the silver screen. If only he could escape to her world, where he wasn't tormented by Mr. Harris, his lunatic, sausage-eating, Scottish boss. Andrei, the Russian cinema cleaner also dreams of a life on the silver screen. If only he could escape from his world of sweeping floors and scrubbing toilets. Enter Antonio, the impossibly neurotic Italian film director, who is determined to make a name for himself with his new epic 'Red Carpet', a combined remake of Cinema Paradiso and Pulp Fiction. He is a man who is destined to change the lives of everyone he meets ...but only if he clinches a deal with movie mogul Harold Winestain.
