The Cahana Sisters

 The unique story of the Cahana sisters - Sara, Riku, Rachel and Esther - reveals a one-of-a kind family drama that took place in the Nazi camps during the final year of World War II. The Cahana Sisters is an incredible true story of courage, survival, and luck. But as it retells this personal and family struggle during the Holocaust, it also follows the ongoing attempts of the sisters to rebuild their lives after the war, in present day Israel, where the shadow of death continues to loom.
