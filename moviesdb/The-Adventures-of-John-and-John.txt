The Adventures of John and John

 'The Adventures of John and John' is the story of two down at heel friends, killing time, bickering, playing games and hoping to become rich and famous using a brain reading machine. The characters are both about three inches high, have wire armatures and have a limited range of expressions. The flaws in their construction reflect and amplify the flaws in their characters and the comic hopelessness of their situation. The characters developed from working with John Hegley,a performance poet, on animating a surreal sketch John had performed with Simon Munnery, where one person thinks of a breed of dog and the other person has to guess which one he's thinking of. This dialogue became the starting point for the script. The 'Brain Reading Machine' gave the opportunity to improvise and combine different animation techniques, as they attempt to 'produce a dazzling array of cartoons, exciting-police-dramas-like-on-the-TV, and a 'Proper Music Video'.
