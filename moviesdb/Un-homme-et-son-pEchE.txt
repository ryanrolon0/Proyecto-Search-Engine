Un homme et son pEchE

 In the mountain of the north of Montreal in the colonization period, Seraphin a greed man is mostly the only one to have some money between the inhabitants. He used it as an usurer to grab all the land of the poor people. Alexis who was in love with Donalda before she was forced to became Seraphin's wife, borrow him 200$ to help starting his farm. He's counting on a temporary government job to pay back the greed man but Seraphin will use his political position as a colonization's agent to make sure he won't get it.
