The Dinner Party

 Luke has a good job, great friends and a fantastic social life. He lives in his dream flat in London, where he was born and raised. Jessica lives in the Lancashire countryside, she is well-liked, pretty and has many friends to spend her time with. Both are unhappy, despite their fortunate lives. Until Now! Luke has allowed us access into his life, as he says goodbye to the hustle and bustle of London and travels up north to be with his one true love, Jesse. We follow Jesse and Luke as they begin living together as a real couple, without dreading Sunday nights and Lukes journey back to London. We follow this dreamy couple as they begin to live their own personal dream, of sharing each moment together. Jesse has arranged a surprise dinner party in Luke's honor and has invited several friends to welcome him into village life, which is an innocent and loving thing to do, until it descends into a nightmare that simply doesn't want to end. As the alcohol flows freely, tempers begin to flare and the conversation gets heated, and then just one more unwelcome guest; a guest that insists on joining the party and delivering a brand of brutal truth that captures the attention of the rowdy bunch and one that is about to unlock the very darkest of secrets.
