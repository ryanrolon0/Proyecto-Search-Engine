The Crossmaker

 Jerusalem, 1st century AD. Jewish carpenter Shimon is enslaved to make crosses for the Roman army which his fellow Jews will be crucified on. When an injured young rebel seeks a safe hiding place in his workshop, Shimon's conscience and loyalties are called into question, as he must decide whether to protect his family and accept the hold that the Romans have over him, or stand-up and try to change his situation.
