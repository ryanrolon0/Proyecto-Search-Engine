Samodivsko horo

 The local painter in a small provincial town becomes the main attraction after opening an exhibition. The event is commemorated festively, the elite of the town is there and everyone wants to share his opinion about the art. One of the paintings, however, depicts a fairy dance of young, naked women and vigilant citizens discover similarities with a certain lady. The painting disappears, but in the end it is restored in a totally unexpected way.
