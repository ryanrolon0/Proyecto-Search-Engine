Reading Subway

 This picture shows the steam shovel at work, Broad and Callowhill Streets, Philadelphia, digging dirt and placing it on the freight cars. It also shows the locomotive and train in motion. The train backs up to the shovel, and the dirt is scooped up and carried to the car, when the attendant pulls a rope and the dirt is seen to fall in the car.
