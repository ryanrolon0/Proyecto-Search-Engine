Rogue of the Range

 Doran and the Sheriff have a scheme to bring in an outlaw gang. Doran is sent to prison so he and the gang leader Mitchell can break out. This gets him into the gang but he is in trouble when it's revealed he is working with the Sheriff. U.S. Marshal Dan Doran ('Johnny Mack Brown' (qv)), working undercover with Sheriff Tom ('Horace Murphy' (qv)) of Gold Gap, stages a holdup so he can be sent to prison and gain the confidence of a jailed gang-member Jim Mitchell ('George Ball (VI)' (qv)). They are allowed to escape, and Dan is made a member of the gang, secretly led by Gold Gap bank manager Lige Branscomb ('Alden 'Stephen' Chase' (qv)).
