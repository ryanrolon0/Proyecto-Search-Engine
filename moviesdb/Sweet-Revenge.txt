Sweet Revenge

 Sweet Revenge tells the story of Matt and Sweet. Two men brought together by drugs and dirty money. Matt distributes what Sweet provides. No questions asked. So when Sweet's stash of coke goes missing, with no money in sight and a pusher with inexplicable actions, all roads lead to Matt. What unfolds is a tense interrogation as Sweet finds out exactly who Matt is and, more importantly, where his drugs are.
