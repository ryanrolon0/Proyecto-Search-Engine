The King of Rocks

 "King of Rocks" takes a look inside the obscure and competitive "cult sport" of rock crawling. Teams invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in their monster vehicles and gather on weekends to literally scale the walls of mountains. "King of Rocks" focuses on the personalities of the competitors as the camera crew follows Dean Bulloch (aka Ice Man) and Karl Munford (aka Krazy Karl) as they attempt to win their first national rock crawling title in Salt Lake City. "King of Rocks" is a co-production of Essex Television Group Inc. and Discovery HD Theater.
