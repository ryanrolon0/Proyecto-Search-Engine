Romeo y Lorenza

 Romeo materialist, and superficial. Romeo is tired of the humiliations of his wife and decides to leave the house and change his physical appearance. He uses the aid of his faithful friend Justi ("a fine" homosexual) as to become a wonderful "Big Papi". How will it go when Lorenza encounters her new husband?
