Victor James is a story about decisions - and the unknown consequences that come with making these decisions. The film centers around Victor James and his longtime sidekick Darcey Collins, who settle debts for a compulsive gambler named Dirk Mendelson. Mendelson tries his wares at various underground gambling hot-spots throughout the country, racking up gaming debt (otherwise known as 'juice') owed to the gaming operators. Rather than paying off these debts, he sends Victor and Darcey to deal with these unsavory folks, using their 'persuasive' tactics to get the operators to see things their way. But when the duo runs into Randall Smith, a veteran gambler with a nose for trouble, things don't go quite according to plan. Dealing with Randall also causes Darcey to question her commitment to Victor and Dirk; a five year relationship that has become tumultuous at best due to Dirk's lack of regard for her and Victor's lack of commitment to her. Darcey hastily decides a new life is in order by giving Randall key information on the whereabouts of Mendelson for $50,000 - money she plans to use to 'settle down' and start a new life. Randall and his associates Calvin Moody and Dustin Smith use this information to capture Dirk and stage a trap for Victor - a trap that presents Victor with the ultimate problem to solve.
