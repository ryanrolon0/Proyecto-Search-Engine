The Chronicles of Holly-Weird

 From the outside it seems like Holly has it all. She's at the top of her field, a well known red carpet celebrity interviewer for Z TV, a string of young hot actors lining up to date her, and still doesn't need lipo or botox even after hitting thirty. But the reality is she's miserable, alone and nursing an addiction to one night stands mixed with a healthy dose of Xanex. Comedy and reality collide on the red carpets of of Hollywood and are regurgitated in therapy sessions of one seriously messed up entertainment industry powerhouse chick.
