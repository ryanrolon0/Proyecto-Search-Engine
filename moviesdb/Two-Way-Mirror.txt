Two Way Mirror

 Two-Way Mirror is a short experimental narrative about an artist who struggles to find meaning and worth through her work. Her internal struggle manifests itself through the editing of her film, to her frustration. In the end she plants the rejected clips into pots of soil hoping they will be able to sprout something meaningful where she could not.
