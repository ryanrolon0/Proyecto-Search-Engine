The Late President Faure of France

 "This picture shows President Faure accompanied by a large party of friends, leaving the shooting box, on their way to the covers where they indulge in pheasant shooting shown in our picture No. 294E [PRESIDENT FAURE SHOOTING PHEASANTS]. The photography of these pictures is very fine; an excellent portrait of the various members of the party is given."
