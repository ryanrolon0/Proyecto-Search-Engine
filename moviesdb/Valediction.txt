Valediction

 The story of Tiffin, Ohio, is one reminiscent of many other small, rural towns all across America. Directed, filmed, and edited by Christie Goshe, this project (conceived during her final years at Bennington College) spans two years in the life of Tiffin, addressing the filmmaker's own personal politics that were formed by a lifetime of experiences in this rural Midwestern town. Valediction presents Tiffin from the perspective of the filmmaker's grandfather and father, men who have never known anything but life in Tiffin; a former factory worker turned hot dog salesman; a married couple who still own a farm despite the lack of profits; war protesters demonstrating in a historically "red" county; and independent grocery store owners who foresee the end of their generations-old business.
