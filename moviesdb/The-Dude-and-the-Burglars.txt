The Dude and the Burglars

 Two burglars have just entered an elegant-looking home, but before they can proceed, the woman of the house enters the room. One of the burglars seizes her, but then her husband enters and gets her free of the burglar's grasp. But the husband did not notice the second burglar, who now comes to the aid of his partner - and a tense confrontation is about to begin.
