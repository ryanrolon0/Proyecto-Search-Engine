Shine On, Harvest Moon

 The one time partnership between two men has turned into a full fledged range war. Roy is the son of one of the former partners, the heroine is daughter to the other. The film featured and debuted the then popular radio duo Lulubelle and Scotty. Jackson and his gang are cattle rustlers holed up in Jackson Hole Wyoming. Roy's partner Brower was once Jackson's partner and is now suspected of being in cahoots with him. Someone is tipping off Jackson as to the cattle's whereabouts and when Roy learns who it is he has a plan to trap Jackson and clear his partner. Pa Jackson and his sons, Shag and Ben, come to the Milt Brower - Roy Rogers ranch while Roy, Claire Brower, the ranch hands and Lulu Belle and Scotty are attending a dance. Jackson wants Brower, his former partner, to join with him on the formation of a rustling gang, since the Brower-Rogers ranch is the gateway to a high granite range accessible by only one pass, and by the time a posse could travel the hundred miles to the other end of the pass, the cattle could be moved and sold. Brower declines, but the granite range becomes known as Jackson's Hole as Jackson and his sons and gang rustle cattle unchecked. Homer Sheldon, president of the Stockmen's Bank, accuses Brower of informing Jackson when and where to strike.
