The Ex-Convict

 A former convict, now released from prison, is determined to support his wife and child. But with no references, and a past that can be used against him, he has little success in finding work. Even amidst his discouragement, on one occasion he bravely saves a young girl from being run over. But when his luck continues to be bad, he gradually becomes desperate, and he begins to wonder if he may need to return to his old ways after all.
