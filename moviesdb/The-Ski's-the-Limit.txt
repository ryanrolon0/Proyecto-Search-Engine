The Ski's the Limit

 A combination cartoon/travelogue set in the Swiss Alps, with a tuneful sight-seeing tour of Switzerland thrown in, before the bounding-ball comes bouncing along and asks the theatre audience to follow it in singing the ever-popular "I Miss My Swiss Miss, My Swiss Miss Misses Me." Some of the theatre singers may have actually thrown in a yodel or two.
