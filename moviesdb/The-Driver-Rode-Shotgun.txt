The Driver Rode Shotgun

 Two best friends, Jeremy and Martin, steal a car and accidentally drive down a one way, veering another car off the road. When Jeremy gets out and enters the other vehicle to see if the driver is alright, he discovers he's dead, just in time for a cop to arrive and assume that he was a passenger in the car. The tragedy brings out the two sisters of the deceased, who barely knew their own brother. As Jeremy plays the role of the friend, the sisters look to him to learn more about a man they never knew.
