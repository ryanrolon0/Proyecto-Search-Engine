 'Underground Street Flippers' is the journey of Daren who has been accepted into college but was denied his scholarship. Determined to fund his education, Daren begins searching for a job only to discover a secret society of corner sign twirlers. Daren proves to be quite a skilled flipper until he goes head-to-head with the only thing standing between him and winning his tuition; none other than the 'greatest sign flipper of all time'.
