The Old Rawlins House

 Dave, a nickel-and-dime criminal and professional burglar, gets his comeuppance when he returns to his old neighborhood to look for the stash of money a deceased local farmer - Bill Rawlins - was reputed to have hidden away in his old ruined homestead. The house turns out to have a life of its own as it traps him inside and he realizes he's not the first one with the same idea to come this way. But what he finds in The Old Rawlins house is a lot more than he'd bargained for!
