Truk Lagoon

 Known to the U.S. Navy as the "Gibraltar of the Pacific" since the late 1930's, the Japanese had occupied this coral atoll since after WW I. This was very strategic to the Japanese to their build up of the Pacific military and other resources. This coral atoll was called, Truk Lagoon. Truk Lagoon (now known as Chuuk, FSM, South West of Guam) was known as the revenge of Pearl Harbour for Japan. The US Naval Task Force 58.1 launched early morning attacks and the first ever night attacks over February 17th & 18th, 1944, by the time it was all over, the US bombs & torpedoes had sent at lease forty sufficient ships to the bottom of the lagoon, and over 200 aircraft had been destroyed. The documentary, "The Legacy of Truk Lagoon" takes you back to Feburary 1944 were the defenders fought bravely but were overwhelmed by the by the air barrage, code-named "Operation Hailstone." Also rare footage that shows, years later, when the Japanese were allowed to finally bury their dead. Trukese survivors,Japanese and American veterans share their own stories of hell throughout this production. Stunning underwater footage of the wrecks and a search for the only ship that was never found, is part of this great documentary shot for the A&E's, "The History Channel."
