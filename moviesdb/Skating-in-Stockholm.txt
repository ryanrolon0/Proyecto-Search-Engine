Skating in Stockholm

 An excellent picture of a winter scene in Stockholm, in which a large number of people are indulging in the national sport of ice skating. There are two fancy skaters in the immediate foreground of the picture, who execute various difficult feats of fancy ice skating. An extremely interesting and typical picture.
