Strictly G.I.

 A filmed broadcast of the Command Performance radio programs in which various Hollywood stars appeared and performed in accordance with letter requests from American service men stationed around the world. Transcriptions were made of each program and sent to American posts and camps around the world. This entry (Army-Navy Screen Magazine No. 20) was broadcast and filmed at a live performace at Camp Roberts, California. Lana Turner, via a request from a group of soldiers, fried a steak, which was brought on stage accompanied by armed guards since this was a rationed and rare item during the war years. Betty Hutton sung "Murder, He Says" and Judy Garland did "Over the Rainbow", and all three guest stars swapped quips and banter with emcee Bob Hope, with Hope usually on the butt-end of the jokes.
