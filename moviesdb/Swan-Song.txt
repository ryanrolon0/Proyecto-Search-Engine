Swan Song

 The film closely explores that most base of human struggles - our heart's desire. The events of the film center around the death of Gary, Beth's husband, who is serving in Afghanistan. On the same morning he dies, she discovers she is pregnant. The child is not Gary's we discover, but David's. David and Beth are forced to deal with the consequences of a man's death, and of an illicit love affair.
