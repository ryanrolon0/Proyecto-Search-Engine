Star 80

 'Paul Snider (II)' (qv) is a narcissistic, small time hustler who fancies himself a ladies man. His life changes when he meets 'Dorothy Stratten' (qv) working behind the counter of a Dairy Queen. Dorothy is a pretty but naive high school senior. Paul immediately falls for Dorothy, who sees in Paul a wise, worldly person unlike herself. Paul believes Dorothy is Playboy material, the magazine he sees as only a springboard to bigger and better things. Paul's dream does become a reality 1979 Playboy Playmate and ultimately Playboy Playmate of 1979, which does indeed lead to the start of an acting career. As Dorothy's star rises, Paul's life is one of a hanger-on as those in Dorothy's new circle, including Playboy publisher 'Hugh M. Hefner' (qv) and movie director Aram Nicholas, don't much like Paul. Paul is unable to eke out a life of his own without using Dorothy's name, which she increasingly is reluctant to provide to her husband. Those that know the couple know their relationship cannot continue as is, and it's only a matter of how it will change or end is the question. Paul Snider, discovered Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, pushed her toward stardom, and worshiped her at the altar of the Playboy mystique. Snider wants people to "treat us that special way, the way they treat Stars!" and when Stratten tries to shake him off her coattails, he explodes.
