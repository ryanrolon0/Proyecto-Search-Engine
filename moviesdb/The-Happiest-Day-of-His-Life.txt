The Happiest Day of His Life

 THE HAPPIEST DAY OF HIS LIFE is a light-hearted film that, through a colorful lens, subtly challenges gender roles and traditions with a sense of humor. Depicting a classic, traditional wedding and following the iconic scenes from typical Hollywood wedding movies like FATHER OF THE BRIDE, THE HAPPIEST DAY OF HIS LIFE reverses both gender roles and our assumptions.
