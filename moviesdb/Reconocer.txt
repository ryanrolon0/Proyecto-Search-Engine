 A year ago, Jack and his family were on holiday in the Pacific Northwest when the car he was driving mysteriously spun out of control. Jack woke up in a hospital two weeks later, with no memory of the accident and little memory of the last nine years. Laura, Jack's wife, and Elizabeth, his daughter, are presumed dead; the mangled car was found on the rocky shore of a beach below a steep cliff. When Jack recovered, he discovered that the police had closed the file, ruling his family's death "accidental." But Jack feels there is something more to this story ... something sinister. Was the accident really an accident? Or was it a deliberate attempt to silence Jack? Jack finds the authorities unwilling to delve deeper, while his few friends and colleagues urge him to "get on with his life."
