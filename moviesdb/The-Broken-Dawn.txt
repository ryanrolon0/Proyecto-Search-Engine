The Broken Dawn

 Between dusk and dawn, there is a witness to a great unknown crime. The witness, Erin, is now being protected by three federal agents, the leader of which, Fellowes, she begins to feel on a romantic plane. After the midnight hour, an intruder finds his way into the safe house Erin is kept. The three agents must now protect their witness at all costs. When the intrusion occurs, the action begins, spanning from a glorious mansion to the freeways of Southern California, to a small airport where escape can be met. 'The Broken Dawn' will take you on an adventure of pure adrenaline, where racing against time is only half the battle.
