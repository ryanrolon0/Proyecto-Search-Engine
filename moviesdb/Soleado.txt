Soleado

 A music composer from New York new to Los Angeles finds himself desperate for any kind of human interaction, even if in the form of letters left on the windshields of his car to complain about parking etiquette. A progressively obsessive exchange of messages developes with a mysterious neighbor. Somewhere between discouragement, hostility, isolation, and a bad engine, Hector manages to strike a connection and get his life, literally, back in gear.
