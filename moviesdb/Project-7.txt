Project 7

 When you work for Project 7, if you leave, you die, it's a rule. Project 7 is the secret intelligence agency that performs inhumane experiments to see just how far the human population can go. By learning how to break down individuals defenses, they can further strengthen their own nation and army. But what will happen when a new employee Angel who has full intentions of bringing the firm down, suddenly falls in love with everything that she despises? Will the firms lead researcher, Dylan Wright be able to walk away from all that he is and all that he knows to save the life of the woman who tries to destroy him?
