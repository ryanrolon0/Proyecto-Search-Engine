The Spirit of 1918

 In this early demonstration of the Vitaphone sound system, conductor Herman S. Heller conducts the Vitaphone Symphony Orchestra in the title work. It is basically a medley of patriotic songs from World War I. This film was the first of several shorts first presented in a New York movie theater on 7 October 1926.
