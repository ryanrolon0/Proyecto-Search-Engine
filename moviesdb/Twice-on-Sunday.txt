Twice on Sunday

 The story of brother and sister, Catherine and Matt. Catherine, seven years the elder, is in San Francisco taking care of Matt, who is in a wheelchair recovering from a failed suicide attempt. A week earlier, he and his girlfriend went up on the Golden Gate bridge to jump. She died, he survived. The play is ultimately about a brother and sister who have lost touch until this tragedy reunites them.
