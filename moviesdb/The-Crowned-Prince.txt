The Crowned Prince

 Prince Dumski, loved by Princess Wondetvitch, is unpopular with his subjects who delight in using him as a tomato target. He flees to America, followed by the emissaries of the Princess with intent to bring him back. He hides in a pressing plant in the slums, where the emissaries grab Lige, a flunky in the shop who is a dead-ringer for the Prince, and drag him back to Europe under protest. But after seeing the Princess he takes the throne. A terrorist, hiding behind the throne, places a bomb in the crown. Lige tries to throw it away but it is covered with glue. He finally gets rid of it and blows the seat out of the Prime Minister's pants. A cannon-ball blows him into the arms of the Princess, and they live happily ever after.
