Swordplay

 Embedded deep within our culture is a world unlike any other. A world divided into kingdoms where knights duel and creatures still lurk in shadow. A world where magic and imagination are your allies. Welcome to the world of Amtgard, an international live action role playing game (LARP) involving swordplay and sorcery styled after the medieval times. Armed with foam swords and a camera, two filmmakers embark on a perilous journey deep into the uncharted territory of this highly overlooked and often stereotyped subculture. Prepare yourself for Swordplay!
