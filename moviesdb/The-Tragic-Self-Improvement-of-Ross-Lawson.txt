The Tragic Self-Improvement of Ross Lawson

 For social reject Ross Lawson, the good life is the one he doesn't have. This gradually begins to change when one night he discovers that anything he types into his online i-Space profile actually becomes reality. With this new identity manipulation tool, Ross sets about transforming himself in hopes of winning over Kelly, the most popular girl in high school. Willing to exchange his good friends for this new popular lifestyle, Ross' life is looking up... or so it would seem. But little by little, his choices begin to backfire, finally risking not only the new identity he thought he always wanted, but the original identity he always had.
