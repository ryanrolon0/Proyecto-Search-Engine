 Hearing his brother the Express Clerk is in trouble, Bob Williams rides to the Express Office only to find the safe open, his brother and the money missing, and himself accused of the robbery. To clear himself he trails and finds the outlaws engaging them in a fight. But during the melee, the gang leader double-crosses his men and sneaks away with the money and Bob now has to catch him.
