Satan's Schoolgirls

 When seemingly well-intentioned Father Thomas signs on for a quiet summer school session at a rustic school for girls in the country, he gets more than he bargained for. Once inside, Father Thomas has his hands full dealing with four seriously troubled young girls each with a taste for lust, and strict Sister Helen - a disciplinarian who serves up punishment with glee. This Catholic School's foundation is solid evil and the walls are covered with blood. When all hell breaks loose, you can be sure that here no one is what they seem!
