Tao of M

 The story of New Orleans Vampire "Midael" is revealed in the ISIS FILMS production of "Tao of M". A simple family man, he is damned to walk the earth, undead - feeding on the innocent to quench his bloodlust. Peter Steele makes a rare motion picture cameo as Viktor Baine, the ancient Vampire who sires Midael.
