Separations

 This autobiographical film explores migration, identity, and family relations through a close engagement with a Brazilian family whose members live scattered all across the world. Andrea, a filmmaker who lives in Amsterdam, talks with her siblings and parents. This takes her back to her past, her lonely childhood, and her mother's escape from the Nazis in 1939. The question of the migratory turns both backwards and forwards. On the one hand there is Edith, Andrea's Jewish mother who, as a little girl, fled with her parents and ended up in Brazil. On the other hand there is Andrea who, like her siblings, left Brazil to build a life abroad.
