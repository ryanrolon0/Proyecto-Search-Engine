The Accidental Advocate

 When Claude Gerstle, a surgeon and athlete, suffers a tragic bicycle accident that leaves him paralyzed from the neck down, he and his daughter, Jessica Gerstle, track down the scientists, ethicists, religious authorities, and politicians to understand the promise of stem cell research and why a political quagmire is stalling a cure. At the same time they embark on an emotional journey that celebrates the importance of family ties.
