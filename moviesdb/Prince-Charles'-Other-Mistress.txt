Prince Charles' Other Mistress

 Prince Charles' Other Mistress tells the fascinating, largely unknown and ultimately tragic story about his intense relationship with Australian heiress Dale "Kanga" Tryon. For a period in the 1970s Kanga (Lady Tryon), and Camilla Parker Bowles were deadly rivals for the Prince's affections. Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana. With exclusive and previously unseen interviews with Dale herself and heartfelt contributions from friends and journalists who knew her well including Oscar-nominated actress Sarah Miles. Prince Charles' Other Mistress will shed new light on, and add a new name to, the familiar landscape of the relationship between Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles and Diana, Princess of Wales.
