Robert Capa, l'homme qui voulait croire à sa lEgende

 Robert Capa has been the icon of a whole generation of photo journalists and embodies the very spirit of adventure photographer with a tragic end. Yet, very little exists on the real man on film. The film takes its departure with the photo that "made" Robert Capa the Spanish Republican mortally wounded in front of his camera. The question of the photo's authenticity is the 'knot' of our story. This shot came to be regarded as Capa's guiding principle of his job get to the action, the better the photo and its impact! Despite many contradictions, Capa's legend lives on.
