Turning Darkness Into Light

 Deborah Kampmeier's powerful, coming-of-age film "Hounddog" sparked a media firestorm when fringe media pundits attacked the film (site unseen) prior to it's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. But the efforts from fundamentalist extremists to censor the film were overshadowed by the enthusiastic response from audiences and women's groups who recognized the importance of the film's message. Documentarian Jon McCallum presents an insightful look at the challenges presented by the filmmakers to complete 'Hounddog' and get it released to theaters, despite death threats, business interference and other obstacles presented by those who would prefer to ignore a problem than deal with it.
