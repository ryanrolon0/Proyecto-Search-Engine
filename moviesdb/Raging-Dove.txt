Raging Dove

 Welterweight boxer Johar Abu Lashin is a man torn by contradictions. Palestinian by birth, Israeli by circumstance and American by choice, Lasheen has hopes of healing Arab-Israeli enmity through the power of sport. In this award-winning documentary, filmmaker Duki Dror follows the young champion as he defends his title in bouts in Nazareth and Gaza. Lasheen is a man in constant battle with himself, Dror observes; "The only place where he truly feels whole, or at home, is in the ring." Alas, in the Middle East, politics never takes a time out.
