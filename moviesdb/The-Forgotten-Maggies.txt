The Forgotten Maggies

 The documentary focuses on the human rights aspect of the Magdalene Laundries and shows how State and Church colluded to remand and keep these women against their will. The film challenges the audience to look beyond the historical significance of these institutions and most importantly, focuses on the impact this experience had on the women in their daily lives once the laundries closed down. It asks the important questions of why and how these institutions were allowed to carry on until late 1996. It asks why these women never received a public apology or redress from either State or Church. As young people living in Ireland, we believe it is essential for this to be acknowledged equally with the industrial school, convent home, orphanage and other environments of abuse.
