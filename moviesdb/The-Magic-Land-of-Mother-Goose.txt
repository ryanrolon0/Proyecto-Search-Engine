The Magic Land of Mother Goose

 Shot entirely on a high school stage, a group of storybook characters emerge from the book of Mother Goose leading to Old King Cole walking out of the book and into our world, followed by Raggedy Ann, while other characters, including Merlin the Magician pop out of the book with the help of Mother Goose to bring her flock back into her book world.
