Viajero

 Coined an Ambient Film by Kim Merlino, this is an experimental silent film inspired by 19th century poet Joaquin Miller, the flamboyant and controversial writer who spent a brief part of his life living near beautiful Mt Shasta.Viajero feels like a tale of magic realism and a visual excursion through the Siskiyous Mountains of Northern California. Evoking images both lyrical and powerful in their concrete immediacy and enigmatic randomness. It follows a Viajero (traveler in Spanish) walking through these landscapes interacting with and pausing at, its wonders, both natural and supernatural.
