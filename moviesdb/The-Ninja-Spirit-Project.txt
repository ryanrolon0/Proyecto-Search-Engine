The Ninja Spirit Project

 In August 1999 three ninjas disappeared in the woods near Eastbay. They were trying to find and make a movie about the spirits of ninja. Four weeks later their footage was found. Relatives and friends of the ninjas have cut the material together to get a picture about what really happened out there.
