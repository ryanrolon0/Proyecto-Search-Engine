Strippers Pole

 This faux infomercial features Mike and Kris, a personable couple, who extol the benefits of using a stripper's pole for your basic workout. As they talk about how it works the biceps, triceps, legs and abdominals, there are demonstrations by the svelte and the chubby, the trim and the unfit. After explaining that it tones your arms, legs, and that hard-to-reach Q zone, Mike and Kris turn to people in the street to get candid testimonials on the salubrious benefits of the stripper's pole.
