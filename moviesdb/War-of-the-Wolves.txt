War of the Wolves

 During the violent last days of feudal era Japan, Sanosuke joins the revolution that will decide the future of the country. A man with strong ideals and even stronger morals, Sanosuke is hit with the harsh reality of the brutality of war, and the months and years of involvement of the seemingly endless violence takes its toll on him. A violent turn of events forces Sanosuke to make difficult choices of where his loyalties lie the men he serves, to his own morals, or to his family. "Reunion" is a short developed from a treatment for the feature film "War of the Wolves". "Reunion" is based off of a pivotal scene in the feature length story where the main characters must decide which sides they must take before the war reaches its violent conclusion.
