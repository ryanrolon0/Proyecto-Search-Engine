Rough and Tumble-Weed

 A narrator tells us that in the days of the Old West, times were tough. With no law and order, bandits roamed around free to commit any crime with western outlaw, "Pretty Boy" McCoy being the worst of the bunch. Fortunately, a famous detective, Inspector Willoughby, is called in at last to capture McCoy. He arrives in Doughnut Center ("What a hole!" says the Inspector) and finds McCoy playing cards in a bar. McCoy sends the pest on his way but Willoughby keeps returning using a variety of schemes to capture the outlaw culminating with McCoy locking the Inspector in a safe throwing a lit keg of dynamite inside. But the Inspector escapes and the criminal finds himself chained to the dynamite-filled safe! After some unsuccessful attempts to get rid of the safe, McCoy admits defeat and Willoughby arrests him. But on the way to jail, the narrator reminds him, "What about that dynamite?" The safe explodes and the battered Inspector chastises the narrator, "You and your big, fat mouth!"
