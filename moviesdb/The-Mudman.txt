The Mudman

 Mudmen are creatures made of magic and mud. In appearance, they can be very much like you and me. A well-made mudman could walk freely among us. However, most mudmen are slaves to their makers, the White Witches. The Whites consider mudmen to be cowardly, dim-witted and generally disgusting. HUMBUG is an unusual mudman. He is a wanderer, apart from his maker. He has learned things about the world and about himself. He will face his greatest challenge yet when he answers a cry for help in downtown LA. In the dungeon of a great witch, Humbug finds creatures of his own kind. In order to help them find freedom, Humbug must help the mudmen see themselves as more than slaves, more than mud.
