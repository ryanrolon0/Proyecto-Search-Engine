 Arthur Martinez, Laura Mayo and Rachael West star in this quirky romantic comedy, produced in 72 hours for the MockSides Ultimate Filmmaker Challenge. Hapless romantic Morris (Martinez) just wants a quiet, pleasant date with Olivia (West) - while avoiding her temperamental friend Renee (Mayo) as much as possible. But when he wakes the next morning with a foggy memory and a strange female in his bedroom he must come to terms with the possibility that Olivia and Renee just might not be who they said they were. Featuring original music composed by Michael Anthony Garner.
