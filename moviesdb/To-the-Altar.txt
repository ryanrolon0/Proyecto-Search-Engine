To the Altar

 It is the social event of the season, the wedding of celebutante Alessandra Dumont. But, as she makes her way from the knave to the altar, she cannot help but reflect on the circumstances and relationships that have brought her here and to the man she is about to marry. Will she/should she say, "I do?"
