The Little Red Hen

 A hen and her chicks stumble across some wheat. The hen asks other farm animals to help her sow the wheat, but they all decline. They also refuse to help her water and harvest the wheat or bake bread with the resulting grains. She and her chicks manage to do all the work themselves, then delight in refusing to share the bread with the animals who would not help her to make it.
