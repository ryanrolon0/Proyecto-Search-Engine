The Shrimp on the Barbie

 Carlos failed in the show-biz and currently works as waiter in a Mexican restaurant. There he meets Alex and dumb footballer Bruce, who celebrate their engagement with her parents. Alex' father is less than thrilled of her fiancEe and says he'd rather accept anybody else. Eventually Alex hires Carlos to present him as her new fiancEe. But her father sees through the game... An unemployeed Mexican-American decides to try his job hunting luck in Austrailia. Naturally, he's like a fish out of water. His adventures are ammusing, but the movie isn't gut-busting funny.
