Shi-Shi-Etko

 Young native Indian Shi-Shi-Etko will soon be taken away from her home to begin her formal western education at a residential school, which were designed to solve the Indian "problem". Her mother, father and grandmother want her to remember her native roots and they wait for her return in the spring to continue passing down those ideals to her. In the meantime, the Indian community is barren of children.
