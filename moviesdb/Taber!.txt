Taber!

 A film about attitudes and self-insight. The protagonist, Mads, was a front figure in the band "Madssacre" in the 80's. In the 90's, he's an anachronistic wreck. Booking manager Lone's attempts to recreate the band is doomed to failure. Repeating the past can't solve the problems of the present. At the end of the film, both Mads and Lone have reached a point where they can start liberating themselves from their attitudes.
