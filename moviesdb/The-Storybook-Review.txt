The Storybook Review

 A compilation of 4 Mother Goose stories "photographed in three dimensional animation" and unified by a prologue and an epilogue with Mother Goose herself magically setting up a projector to show the films. The familiar stories are "Little Miss Muffett," "Old Mother Hubbard," "The Queen of Hearts" and "Humpty Dumpty."
