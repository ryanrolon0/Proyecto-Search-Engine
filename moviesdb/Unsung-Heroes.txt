Unsung Heroes

 Documentary filmmakers follow two Orange County superheroes Frisbee Guy. In a town that is seemingly without crime, the rag-tag duo find themselves more often pitted against each other's ego and stubborn concern for justice. But when their evil arch-enemy Klepto the Clown shows up with his evil henchman Mime beside him, things begin to heat up in the ol' OC. There may actually be a day for Razor Boy and Frisbee Guy to save.
