Turn, Smile, Shift, Repeat

 Andrew is a product of the masses. He leads an unsatisfying life, working part-time at a downtown hardware store, seeking the simple pleasures of a flawed man while remaining unfulfilled. But when Andrew finds his growing apathy starting to override his memory, he begins to seek the deeper nature of the disturbance; uncovering truths about himself he may not be ready to face. Turn, Smile, Shift, Repeat takes an introspective look at human nature, examining the contradiction that takes place when an individual is forced to adapt to an artificial and mechanized society.
