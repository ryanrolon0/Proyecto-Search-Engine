The Abominable Snow Rabbit

 While on vacation, Bugs and Daffy take a wrong turn and get lost in the Himalayas. There they encounter the Abominable Snow Man, who happens to be looking for a pet, promising that he will "love him and hug him and call him George." Neither Bugs nor Daffy are too eager to become the object of his affection.
