Wank

 Wannabe filmmakers Ty and Cam have handily sabotaged their plot to crash a major film festival. An ongoing feud about the relative merits of digital versus analog film has inadvertently lost them the only screening copy of their short film "masterpiece". Now they're mere hours from the festival and have no short to crash it with. Both are convinced that outrageous sex, and the guaranteed resulting controversy, will score them the notoriety and fame they deserve - but what kind of gratuitous short-form cinema can two guys pull off in a moving car and no time?
