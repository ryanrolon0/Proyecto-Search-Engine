The Woman Who Believed

 Wild animal drama dealing with the havoc wrought by a jealous mind while three people, forming the eternal triangle, battle for existence in the wilds of the African jungle. The building of a railroad through the jungle, the conflict between the beasts of prey and the little band of explorers, and the dynamiting of a great bridge are a few of the high spots of the story. An aggregation of lions, elephants, leopards, tigers and monkeys, play a prominent part in the unfolding of the plot. (info from Motion Picture News Booking Guide, 3
