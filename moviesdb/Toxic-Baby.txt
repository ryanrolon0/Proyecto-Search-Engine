Toxic Baby

 From the Manhattan skyline to the laboratories of Holland, one mother embarks on a journey of discovery through a surreal landscape of a talking fetus, the Fear Monster, 3 very large men in tiny pink speedos and some of the coolest scientists in the world. Having discovered the issue of chemical toxicity and it's effects on young children, filmmaker Penelope Jagessar Chaffer submits herself to a barrage of toxicity tests and then seeks out some of the best environmental doctors and scientists to discover what lurks in our blood and the effects that is thought to have on young children across the world, leading her to ask "Are we raising the most polluted generation in the history of the planet?"
