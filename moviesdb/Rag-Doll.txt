Rag Doll

 When 15-year-old Naara wakes one morning to find blood on her underwear, she takes comfort only in her rag doll. As days pass, Naara struggles to communicate with friends and family in this intimate female portrait. Rag Doll portrays the private struggle of a teenage girl's confidential abortion, post-procedure. Without shame, Rag Doll daringly exposes the intimacy of the female body and soul at a moment of isolation and detachment. Regardless of the political, religious, or personal arguments surrounding abortion, Rag Doll aims to support all women by encouraging them to evaluate this social issue on a personal level.
