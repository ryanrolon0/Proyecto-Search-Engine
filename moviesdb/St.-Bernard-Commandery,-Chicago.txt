St. Bernard Commandery, Chicago

 "...Taken at Pittsburgh, Pa., during the triennial conclave of the Knights Templar in the fall of 1898. The commanderies are among the best known in the United States, and all have a very high record for proficiency in drill, and for the high standing of their members. This picture shows the St. Bernard Commandery in the competition drill at Schenley Park."
