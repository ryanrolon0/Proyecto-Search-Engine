Vampire Clan

 Five friends welcome real life vampirism into their lives. They cut their own wrists and let their friends drink from them. Rod, the leader, and a very psychotic young guy, ends up killing Heathers parents and stealing their car to go on a crazy raod trip. His behaviour begins to frighten his friends, though they went along with it at first. All end up in prison except Heather. In 1996, in Eustis, Florida, the parents of two girls are found brutally murdered at their home by the oldest daughter, Jeni Wendorf, and the other one, Heather Ann Wendorf, is missing. A further investigation discloses to the police that a group of Gothic deranged teenagers that worships vampires were responsible for the slaughter of the Wendorf family. The former boyfriend of Heather and also very evil and sick Roderick Justin Farrell, the leader, has killed Rick and Ruth Wendorf trying to open the gates of hell for him.
