 Cowhand Bud Lansing arrives for the reading of his late uncle's will, but his uncle's stepbrother, banker William Carter, has already seen the will, courtesy of shady lawyer Elmer Sprague, and knows he will receive the estate if Bud is already married, or gets married before the upcoming Friday the 13th. Carter enters into an agreement with stranded showman Bill Shelby, his star Leila Wells and her brother Frank Wells to trap Bud into a compromising position and force him to marry Leila. But Bud's pal, Benjamin McGillicuddy, is on to their plan and has one of his own.
