The A Factor

 A documentary film that was shot in Nepal and chronicles the efforts of a committed scientist to bring life-saving Vitamin A capsules to children. The film features the captivating journey of Dr. Alfred Sommer, who was the celebrated Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Sommer made a groundbreaking discovery that Vitamin A capsules can save the lives of millions of children. This finding has led to the largest worldwide medical mobilization since the polio vaccine. In this film, Sommer travels from Katmandu to the Terai region of Nepal. Along the way, he meets locals and Vitamin A volunteers and listens to their stories. Sommer shares tea with a local Lama, delivers Vitamin A to a night-blind pregnant woman, and attends the medical examination of a newborn.
