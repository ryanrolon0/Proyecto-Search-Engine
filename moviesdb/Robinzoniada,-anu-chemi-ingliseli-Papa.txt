 The story, in flashback, of the death of a British Telegraph engineer in Georgia, USSR in 1920. Caught up in a civil war, and a war between his girlfriend and the women the Company send as "Christmas presents", he seeks asylum in a small patch of British territory (round one of his telegraph poles.)
