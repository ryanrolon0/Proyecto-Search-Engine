The Soc Hop

 In 1956 a horrible secret dies with two students, a practical joke gone wrong, as the gym goes up in flames during the school's annual Soc Hop. For the 30 years, Grapevine High School has kept its secrets. The truth about the tragic fire. Samantha is a bright, homely girl, keeping to herself, when she's befriended by Brad, the hot jock of the school. Sam is suspicious, especially when Brad's ex-girlfriend, the popular rich girl, Darla ask Sam over to join their group at the Soc Hop Dance. With support from her brother Rob, Sam decides to go, regardless of her mother's warnings. The dance brings back memories of the original Soc Hop, from poodle skirts, to spin the bottle, to tragic deaths. Sam unwittingly becomes the punch line of a practical joke, just like the one that happened 30 years ago. Only this time, the tragedy affects the popular kids who perpetrated the prank, as one by one they end up dead. You're invited to The Soc Hop ... An invitation to die for.
