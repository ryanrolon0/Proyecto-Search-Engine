Tuscaloosa

 Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 1972. Recent college graduate Billy Mitchell works for his psychiatrist father on the lush grounds of an old-world mental health institution where he falls head-over-heels in love with one of the patients - the beautiful and possibly crazy, Virginia. Unwilling to make decisions about his future, Billy's relationship with Virgina forces him to confront his arrogant indifference as well as dark family secrets - the strange disappearance of his mother twenty years prior, the clandestine activities of his father and his Southern cronies, and the terrible possibility that his father may be a murderer.
