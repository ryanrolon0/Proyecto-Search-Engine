The Big Sur

 This promotional short for _The Sandpiper (1965)_ (qv) visits the coastal area known as The Big Sur, in Monterey County, California, where the movie was filmed. The area's pounding surf, extensive beaches, and beautiful rock formations are a backdrop for the artist community that lives there. We see some of the residents, including painters, poets, photographers, and sculptors.
