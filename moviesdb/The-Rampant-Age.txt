The Rampant Age

 Wealthy playboy Sandy Benton falls for pretty but decidedly less wealthy neighbor Doris Lawrence. She rebuffs his attentions, but scheming golddigger Estelle has her own plans for Sandy. When Doris hears about Sandy's wild times with Estelle, she sets out to show him that she, too, can be a "modern" woman.
