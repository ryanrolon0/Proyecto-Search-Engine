The Pink Ladder

 Four teenage girls - The Leader, The Cynic, The Believer and The Observer - gather in a candlelit bedroom one night to practise witchcraft. The Leader has apparently managed to change her eye colour, but The Cynic remains sceptical. She tries to find logical explanations for this 'magic' while The Believer stays firmly, and blindly, devout. The Leader then decides to have some fun problem conducting a spell that will win her the heart of The Believer's boyfriend... The Observer watches silently as the tension rises between the faithless and the faithful, with both girls clinging to their beliefs as they spiral towards the climax of their fight.
