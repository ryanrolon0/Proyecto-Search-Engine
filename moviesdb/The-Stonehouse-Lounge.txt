The Stonehouse Lounge

 Brian is married with two kids, has a great office job and a house in the country. In walks Cassey, a hot, single, free spirited young woman who only seems to date "losers." They did not mean for it to happen but it did. Watch as the roller coaster ride speeds them along in a film played to a backdrop of great music, laughs and tears that leaves you off at the end of the ride with a no-win ending. Written and directed by Larry Giorgio co-star of the award winning movie "The Lesson."
