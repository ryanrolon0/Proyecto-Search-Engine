The Hamiltons

 Four young adult siblings try to fend for themselves after the mysterious death of their parents. But they harbor some dark secrets which include abducting and killing strangers, and feeding them to a mysterious 'thing' living in their cellar. The Hamiltons seem to be an ordinary American family, living in a small town in Northern California and dealing with the problems of everyday life. They've also been recently adjusting to the untimely death of their parents. David Hamilton, the oldest, has taken it upon his shoulders to pick up the responsibility for the orphaned family. Twins Wendell and Darlene are darker than the other two siblings and have become more conniving in the past few months. The youngest and most sensitive of the family is Francis. Francis recently found an old video camera his parents owned, and is using it to work on a school project about his family. It's through Francis' eyes that we soon get to know the Hamiltons and realize that there are much more disturbing elements lurking below the surface of "ordinary." After the death of their parents, the troubled teenager Francis and the corrupt twins Wendell and Darlene are raised by their older homosexual brother David Hamilton, who sold the farm that belonged to the family. However, the sensitive and confused Francis feels misfit with his siblings and misses his parents; he spends most of his time using a camcorder to film a supposed school project. When Wendell abducts the drifters Dani Cummings and her friend Samantha Teal, he brings them to the cellar of his house. While David daily tortures until he kills Dani, Francis sneaks in the cellar and befriends and feels sympathy for Samantha. When David is ready to kill Sam, Francis rescues her and discloses the tragic secret of his evil family.
