Queen of Broadway

 Sherry Baker ('Rochelle Hudson' (qv)), owner of a sports service (a bookie)is very successful and is highly respected by gamblers in New York City. Ricky Sloan ('Buster Crabbe' (qv)), owner of the Panthers professional football team, is in love with her. Jimmy Carson ('Donald Mayo (I)' (qv)), a six-year-old boy, comes into Sherry's office to place a bet for his mother, who dies shortly after sending Jimmy to place her bet. Sherry reluctantly takes the kid home with her and, after a short while, decides to adopt him. But the court does not approve of Sherry's business, as it is more than somewhat illegal.
