So You Want to Be an Heir

 Joe McDoakes receives a wire telling him he will inherit his grandmother's million dollar estate if he reaches her before she dies. He rushes to her home where he is met by some weird relatives and a weird lawyer. Grandmother informs him the wire is a gag but that the others don't know and will probably try to murder him for the inheritance.
