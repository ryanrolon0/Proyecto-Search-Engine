We Need to Talk

 If you could share one intimate lifetime experience with a young woman, that could potentially save her life...WOULD YOU? Ten Women from the Southside of Chicago open up the pages of their lives in WE NEED TO TALK, and you will be forever changed by their sacrifice and courage. From Producer/Director Janks Morton comes the next installment of the urgent and necessary conversation that will begin to steer the national dialogue in a new direction. With heartfelt, pain-staking and intimate details of their relationship choices, members of the Byrd Group of Chicago share their riveting stories of triumph, trials, tribulations and tragedies. For the first time in African American cinema, the soul of a Black Woman's family, relationship and internal struggles are uncovered, and the pathway to true restoration is shown. This film is guaranteed to resonate and address head on, subjects tucked away in the heart of many African American women, and will empower them to release the enslaving bondage of their past.
