Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo

 The amazingly detailed true story of "The Doolittle Raid" based on the novel of the same name. Stunned by Pearl Harbor and a string of defeats, America needed a victory - badly. To that end, Colonel Jimmy Dolittle, a former air racer and stunt pilot, devises a plan for a daring raid on the heart of Japan itself. To do this, he must train army bomber pilots to do something no one ever dreamed possible - launch 16 fully load bombers from an aircraft carrier! Remarkable in its accuracy, this movie even uses film footage from the actual raid. Based on a true World War II story of several B25 pilots and their crews who volunteer for a secret mission--the first bombing raid on mainland Japan, ingeniously and boldly launched from an aircraft carrier. Recently married Lt. Ted Lawson is among the volunteers placed under the command of Lt.Col. James Doolittle. Attempting to reach recovery bases in China after successfully accomplishing the bombing, Lawson's bomber crashes on the Chinese coast where he and his crew are rescued by Chinese soldiers. This is the story of the famed raid over Tokyo in April 1942 led by Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle. The film concentrates on Lt. Ted Lawson the commander of a B25, the RUPTURED DUCK, and its crew. Having accepted the mission without really knowing what they will have to do, their first task is to learn to take off with only 500 ft. of runway. They also have to learn to drop bombs without the use of their NorDEN bomb sites. The plan is to launch B25's from an aircraft carrier 400 hundred miles from Japanese soil. Once they've dropped their bombs on various Japanese targets, they are to fly on to a part of China that is not under Japanese control. For Lawson and his crew, the raid itself goes well but they are forced to crash land in China. The men are cared for by a kindly group of Chinese villagers, but Lawson has to have his leg amputated.
