Purgatory County

 In a small Texas town, an emotionally unstable native son, Perkins returns after a long absence to find that his brother Duane has been elected sheriff. Much to Perkins' shock, he also discovers that the ambitious and greedy Duane is having an affair with Perkins' wife Liz. Perkins also learns that the family ranch has been turned into a failing emu farm, and that his abusive, chain-smoking mother has passed away and left him only the family gun collection.
