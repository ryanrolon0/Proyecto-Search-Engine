The First Stop to Catharsis

 This Cinema Verite style film is about a couple who divorce because the husband is gay. After several years, they reconnect to go on a road trip from New York to Texas with the hope that by revisiting their past, and using the symbolic locations as a springboard for freeing their emotions, they go from deeply loved but disconnected, to deeply loved and together once again. This film captures the first leg (New York) in their journey and the ex-wife's reluctance to relive the past and partake in the journey.
