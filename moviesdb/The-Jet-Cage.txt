The Jet Cage

 Tweety Bird sits in his house, forlorn over the fact he can't fly outside like other birds because of his hungry puddy predator, Sylvester, who lurks outside. Granny reads an advertisement for a jet-propelled cage and decides to order one, which will allow her bird to fly outside safely. Sylvester doesn't give up easily, of course, and employs several tricks to get at the bird, all which (of course) fail. In the windup, Sylvester joins the U.S. Air Force, vowing to get even with the object of his carnivorous desire. Jet age technology enables Tweety Bird to fly around outdoors without leaving the security of his cage. He has a flying, jet-powered bird cage which he pilots like an airplane. And so, Sylvester Cat's pursuit of Tweety now becomes airborne.
