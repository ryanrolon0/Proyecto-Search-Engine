Raza brava

 Kunta is a "barrabrava" (Football fanatic followers) that remained paraplegic after a fight. In spite of this, nothing matters for him any more than to recover his life and to return to the stadium, along with his friends, to encourage, once again, the soccer club of his life. "Raza Brava" is a sociological look to the both, love and hate, Garra Blanca group, the "barrabrava" of Colo Colo. A closer look of the Popular Chile. Of this country that fights every day to go forward. Of this Chile that projects a shy victory in a soccer field. A movie loaded with emotions that brings together drama and action in 80 minutes of pure passion.
