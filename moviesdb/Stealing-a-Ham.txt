Stealing a Ham

 "Taken in the yards of Swift & Co. Some of the delivery wagons are seen leaving the stores, and as one of them goes out, a thief skillfully abstracts a ham from the back end of the cart. He is seen, however, by the watchman of the yard, and after a short pursuit is captured and arrested."
