Sopralluoghi per un film su un poliziotto ucciso

 Palermo, today. Marcello is a Sicilian journalist who worked round the whole Italy and in foreign countries for lot of years. He came back to Sicily and he is working there. One day, while the returning from one of his services, often in the provincial towns, he received a phone call. A film director, from Rome, ordered him to go for a research about the police officer Giorgio Boris Giuliano in order to realize a film. Giuliano has been killed on 21st July 1979 by the mafia, exactly from Leoluca Bagarella. Marcello accepts well gladly the job and he begins his "hunting." Crossing the city and the memory of his citizens, Marcello meets people who has known the police officer Giuliano, friends of him, people who worked with him, people who followed him example. Marcello meets people which remember the great humanity of Giuliano. And Marcello will actually find it, in the folds of the memories, inside the eyes of the people, he was talking with, in the emotion of their telling. The editing creates a continuum with the telling stories and the scenes we set in 1979, and where we can see Giuliano during his job and the day of his death, the 21st July 1979.
