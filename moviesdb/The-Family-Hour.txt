The Family Hour

 As the host, In Living Color's Tommy Davidson (Black Dynamite) sets the upbeat tone with a sold-out audience at Beverly Hills' historic Wilshire Theatre. Offering their gut-busting takes on the pitfalls of family life are Small Frie (The Queen of Christian Clean), YouTube sensation Kenny Johnson, Chris Spencer (The Jamie Foxx Show) and the outrageous AJ Jamal (Def Comedy Jam).
