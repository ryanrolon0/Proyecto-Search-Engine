The Men Behind the Army

 A fairly comic look into the making of the creatures and battle scenes for the film Army of Darkness (1993). We look at various different skeletons created for the battle, the creation of the pit bitch and some hilarious behind the scenes stories and footage of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Well worth looking at for any avid fan of the Evil Dead trilogy.
