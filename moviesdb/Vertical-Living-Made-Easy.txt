Vertical Living Made Easy

 In the dizzying heights of New York's luxury high-rises and the depths of its infamous tenements, an unstable immigrant grandmother and a 15 year old homeless boy play an emotional game of cat and mouse, as each attempts to secure a place to call "home." As their romance evolves into something darker, this 23 minute short film explores the extremes we will go to in order to find connection.
