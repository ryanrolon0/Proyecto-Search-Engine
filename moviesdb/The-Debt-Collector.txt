The Debt Collector

 A murdering gunslinger faces his demons only to discover that redemption isn't for everybody in... The Debt Collector. Set on the Oklahoma Plains amidst the 1930s Great Depression, HOOVY NASH is an aging gunslinger turned debt collector for the bank. Hoovy is a force to be reckoned with, especially for the poor dirt farmers of the plains. However, when a collection goes awry, a little girl is lost and Hoovy sets out to find her. Saving this girl could be his way in to heaven, or it might just be his ticket straight to hell.
