The Concentratin' Kid

 The Kid makes a bet he can marry the songstress Mary Lou who he has only heard over the radio. She soon arrives as part of Stile's troupe. Just as it looks like he will be successful, she learns of the bet and decides to leave. The Concentratin' Kid becomes enamored of Betty Lou Vaughn, a radio singer whom he has never met nor seen, and bets his cowhand friends he can marry her. Moss Blaine and Art Campbell rustle the cattle while the Kid and his friends are attending Betty Lou's show. The Kid rides to head off Campbell, who has also kidnapped Betty Lou.
