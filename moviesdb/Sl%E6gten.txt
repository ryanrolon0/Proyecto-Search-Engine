Slægten

 Denmark in the nineteenth century. Baron Helmuth von Leunbach returns home from Copenhagen with a young bride, Alvilda, who has a daughter from a previous marriage. The baron's widowed mother dominates her son and, weary of the misfortune of their lineage, disapproves of his character, but sees promise in his marriage. Alvilda, however, finds little interest in Helmuth's farming projects and instead turns to a common house guest, Count Scheele, for comfort. When Helmuth discovers her infidelity his reaction is brutal.
