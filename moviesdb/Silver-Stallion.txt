Silver Stallion

 The Kid and his pals are horse thieves wanted by the law. As he takes a horse from Jan Walton she makes him promise to bring it back. This makes him go straight and when his pals steal Jan's horses he returns them. But Benson, the leader of the horse thieves, along with his gang is after them too and the Kid is greatly outnumbered. Davey Duncan ('David Sharpe (I)' (qv)), has become an outlaw through forced circumstances and he and his pals, Pascal Nolan ('LeRoy Mason' (qv)) and "Freshwater" Jackson ('Chief Thundercloud' (qv)), are known as the most skillful and dangerous horse thieves in the west. Davey is seeking the the unknown killer who framed his brother into a hangman's noose. They join up with another rustler, Tronco ('Thornton Edwards' (qv)), who vows revenge against Davey over a white horse that Davey captured.
