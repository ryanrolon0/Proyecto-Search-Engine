Running Scenarios

 Margaret Silverman's 9 minute experimental video documentary, Running Scenarios,considers the complex question Through a five window split screen we view intimate familial Jewish experience through a Bar Mitzvah and the ritual making Challah, multi-media paintings of youth and Israeli military, and documentary interviews of the Jewish Diaspora, all flank the central figure of a runner, Silverman herself. The runner is at once American, a woman, a mother and Jewish who struggles to reconcile the multi-faceted and non-hierarchical nature of her Jewish identity. This work provides no easy answers, giving the viewer the freedom to be with the question and reconcile the issues for themselves.
