The Los Angeles River

 This 27-minute documentary film about the LA River weaves together citizens' voices, river imagery, historical documents, and visuals from the city's proposed Master Plan. Our goal is to explain how current and past efforts have shaped the debate about what the river and its adjacent areas should look like, and to to motivate people, who may not currently be engaged, to participate in these discussions.
