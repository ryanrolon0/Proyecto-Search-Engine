She'll Be Alright

 Duane is a twenty-year-old playwright who began working for a theater when he was fifteen. He immediately gained recognition by his peers and quickly attained a cult following for his surreal, yet humorous work. As the years went on, however, his work became jaded due to the high expectations, the pressures of deadlines, and the desire to make money. As his relationships dissolve and his writer's block worsens, Duane slowly slips into manic insanity. It is at this point that Duane begins writing his newest play, "She'll Be Alright." As Duane types, the play unfolds before our eyes, introducing Duane's newest character, Wayne (setting up his most self-referential play to date). Wayne waits at a train station for his girlfriend, Marcie. Their reunion leaves Wayne feeling, as he puts it, "trapped." It is revealed that Wayne is a musician, and as he begins to play his newest acoustic piece, we see images of a new character. She is a cold, unemotional female (going along with the "ain" rhyming pattern, we will call her Jane). Her introduction is left vague, as are the descriptions of her in Wayne's songs. As the film progresses, Duane sees his play go from the paper to the stage, become one of the city's most marketable and accessible production, and get optioned for a big budget film adaptation. All the while, Duane slips further and further into a frenzied insanity, having haunting visions of a demonic wolf-man in a business suit.
