Ride the Wake

 Jessica Evans is one of the hottest up-and-coming wakeboarders in the local scene, and she is poised to break out on a national level. However, with the recent death of her mother, she is struggling to find her place in the adult world with only her overprotective and emotionally distant father to help her. Things are turned upside down when a pro snowboarder shows up on her doorstep asking for wakeboarding lessons, and a definite attraction develops. With so many distractions in her life, the biggest obstacles Jessica faces in the upcoming tournament are her own fears, as she worries whether she can compete against the local guys.
