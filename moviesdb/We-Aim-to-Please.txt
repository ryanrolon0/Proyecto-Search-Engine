We Aim to Please

 A short film about female sexuality, making the viewer aware of body image and attitudes towards it by frequent images of two naked females and close-up shots of areas that make them female. The two women discuss what makes them paranoid; fearful, doubtful and also joyful and erotic, in relation to their own bodies.
