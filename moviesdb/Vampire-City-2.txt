Vampire City 2

 Zombies and Vampires wanna destroy Vienna with bad music. They didn't know that Vienna has the worst musicians on this planet. They strike back with Austro Pop and Austrian Volksmusic. Special Agent Ed Wood gets the order to save this planet and suddenly he falls in love with the beautiful Pia who is searching for her boyfriend Robert who has turned into a Zombie. It finally comes to a bloody battle. 'Vampire City 2' is a tribute to Trash Movies like 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and Cult Movies like 'From Dusk Till Dawn' with a real love for that genre including editing and directing mistakes. A movie that never takes itself much too serious.
