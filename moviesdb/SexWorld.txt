SexWorld

 Taking off on WESTWORLD, a bus load of people going to a resort that helps them solve their sexual hang-ups. Everyone and everything is monitored by a huge computer run by a gang of white-coated technicians, which deducts their deepest sexual fantasies - whether or not they are aware of them. The clients are paired off with each other for optimum effect. A bigot, for example, is given a beautiful black woman to make love to, and a frigid housewife is linked up with a tender, soft-spoken lover. Joan and Jerry are a happy couple who want to try new things. Millicent can't arouse Ralph. Lisa is a lonely woman who calls a phone sex operator. Once in SexWorld, Linda and Jo are coupled with each other and then with Jerry. African-American Jill proves to racist Roger "your spigot ain't no bigot". Joan is coupled with Marian. Buxom Millicent gets her aggressive man wish by Phil, not knowing Ralph peeps on them per his voyeurism wish. Telling him he's physically blocked from helping her, Ralph is led away by his mother-lookalike Ann. Dale first gets to meet Alex, who looks like her former girlfriend, and then gentle Latin lover Tomas. A man unofficially knocks on Lisa's door, but she hesitates too long. Instead, she gets her wish to meet the African stud from _Behind the Green Door (1972)_ (qv), Johnnie Keyes. From all over the country, people go to the Sex World resort to solve their sexual problems and explore their erotic desires. The place is staffed by a group of trained technicians who use sophisticated electronic devices to pair up various people in ways that they know will result in their having fabulous sex.
