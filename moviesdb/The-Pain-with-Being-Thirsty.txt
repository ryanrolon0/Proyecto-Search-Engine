The Pain with Being Thirsty

 A film that juxtaposes found footage of Japanese Internment camps in Arizona with a found letter written by Babar Ahmad, a Muslim prisoner accused of running Al-Qaeda websites and awaiting extradition to Guantanamo Bay. In linking the two, the film traces a connection between the way Japanese Americans were perceived during World War II and how Muslims in the U.S. and abroad are being treated in a post-9/11 world while raising larger questions about the fragility of our own freedoms. Babar Ahmad is still in prison.
