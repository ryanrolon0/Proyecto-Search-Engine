Trous bleus

 Images recorded in March 2002 in Kathmandu and in the valley of Langtang (Gosainkund and Helambu), in Nepal. Mixing together images shot on video and on super-8, heterogeneous textures and durations, the framework of this film shot in Nepal is going towards the remote lands of the country, from the first contacts with the city of Kathmandu at the moment of landing to the heights of the Himalayan mountains. Alternating with the images, on black signs, in the heart of the cinematic mechanism, a story, that evokes the recent massacre of the royal family and snatches of the current political vicissitudes of a country on the fringe.
