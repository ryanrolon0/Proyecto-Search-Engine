The Wizard Rockumentary

 Banding together to enjoy Harry Potter and promote literacy and indie music, these young musicians perform across the U.S., rocking libraries and championing a Do-It-Yourself philosophy. It is a music movement unlike any other, raising thousands of dollars for literacy programs and other non-profits, and inspiring kids to be as fearless as Harry in their creativity. The Wizard Rockumentary documents the wizard rock community during the year leading up to the release of the final Harry Potter book, the rise of wizard rock bands from less than 30 to over 450, and their journey from obscurity to international media coverage. Their story will inspire you to take a chance, do what you love, and see what magic can happen.
