Tukuma

 A young Dane, Erik goes to Greenland to investigate the mysterious death of his brother, whom the natives called "Tukuma" (the one who is always busy). Erik has his own troubles from the past, but during his stay in Greenland he is changed forever, after getting in touch with mother nature for the first time in his life.
