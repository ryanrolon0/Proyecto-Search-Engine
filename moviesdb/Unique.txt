Unique

 Trapped within the confines of his diminutive cubicle, Harry Weiss explores the building blocks of his mid-life crisis. Despite being labeled early in his career as someone with huge potential, someone totally unique, this office drone has yet to realize any such promise. He has played his role in the grand scheme of society, exhausting all of the extra-curricular distractions that modern life has to offer. Still, he sits night after night, in the same gray cube, in the same chair, at the same desk. It has cost him his dreams, his pride, and quite possibly his marriage. As he sets out on the home stretch of an undistinguished career, he has become the eroded shell of a man, neatly packaged in a pressed shirt and tie. Fate, it seems, has sold him one future while delivering one that is completely different. Looking through the last few years of his life, he finds that believing you are unique is very different from actually being unique. This epiphany leads to a final frustration. Harry has had enough.
