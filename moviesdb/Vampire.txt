Vampire

 After having been turned into a vampire without the permission of the local vampire prince, you and your sire are brought to trial before the Los Angeles Camarilla, an organization of vampires dedicated to enforcing the Masquerade, the code of laws keeping the existance of vampires secret from the mortal world. Although Prince Sebastian LaCroix executes your sire, an outburst from Anarch leader Nines Roderiguez convinces him to spare your life. After initially sending you on a successful mission to destroy a Sabbat warehouse in Santa Monica, LaCroix begins to see your worth and enlists your aid in finding the Ankaran sarcophagus, which may hold the remains of an ancient vampire and give power to the one who possesses it.
