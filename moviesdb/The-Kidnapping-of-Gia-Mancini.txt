The Kidnapping of Gia Mancini

 When a wildly successful but very shady real estate broker ruins the career of a competitor, her rival vows to get revenge. He chloroforms his nemesis then sets about to humiliate her, stripping her to the waist and photographing her shapely body without her consent. In another story line, a lovely brunette is abducted and hogtied by her captor.
