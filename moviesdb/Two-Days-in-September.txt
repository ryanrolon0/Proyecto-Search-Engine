Two Days in September

 The Corduroy Enduro Started in 1953 by Ron Jackson and Don Charters and today it continues to be the premier two-day off road motorcycle event in Canada. Two Days in September is a feature length film that attempts to capture the excitement and challenges of the early days and tells the story of the event through the decades to the current event. Through interviews with the founders, the work teams, current organizers and riders, as well as vintage footage of the early years and exciting footage from more current Cord runs, the story of the Cord is told by the people who made it what it is today.
