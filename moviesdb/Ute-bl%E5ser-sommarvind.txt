Ute blåser sommarvind

 Claus, an unhappy 28 year old Norwegian insurance company employee quits his job in Oslo and heads for Sweden in order to figure out who he really is. In his travels he meets and falls in love with Liss, a liberated small town woman, but they both have trouble considering a long-term commitment which will curtail their treasured freedom. After separating, Claus heads north and joins a surveying team, where he finds himself attracted to a country girl. Will the big city boy settle down in the rugged wilds of the Northlands, or will he return to the south and negotiate a commitment to Liss?
