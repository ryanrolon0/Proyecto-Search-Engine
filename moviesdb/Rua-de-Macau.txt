Rua de Macau

 Known nowadays as 'Asia's Las Vegas' for its economical boom and gambling, Macau, a former Portuguese Settlement in China, with a dimension of mere 30km², and a Population of 500 000 citizens, is suffering major social and economical changes. In 2007 it received more than 27000000 tourists, equaling its neighbor Hong-Kong. Miri, a cosmopolitan and smart Macau Chinese girl, returns to Macau after studying abroad. Having been working locally for over 2 months, she decides to take a walk trough the old part of town for the first time since her return. As she walks trough the streets, she hears a unique music. This music leads Miri on a journey where she (re)discovers one of the many stories of these century old streets.
