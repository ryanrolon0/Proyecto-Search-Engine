The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw

 A proper English gentleman, traveling in the American West, inadvertently stops an Indian attack on the stagecoach in which he is a passenger. When the stage gets to the nearest town, the raucous Fractured Jaw--which is being plagued by unruly cowbys, bandits and marauding Indians--the story spreads, and he is appointed sheriff. Jonathan Tibbs reckons that a good way to improve the fortunes of his uncle's London gun company is to sell their products in the Wild West, so he sets off for Fractured Jaw. Once there, a series of misunderstandings give him the completely false reputation of being a smooth-talking, fast-on-the-draw gunman, and he is inveigled into becoming sheriff. With the two trigger-happy local ranches squaring up against each other, it's as well he is getting advice from sassy and sweet-on-him Kate. The fact he's somehow become an honorary Indian doesn't hurt, either.
