Us One Night

 At an engagement party, friends Nick, Rebecca, and Geoffrey come face-to-face with questions about their own love lives. Nick is still pining for his ex-girlfriend; Rebecca is struggling with the new realities of living with her boyfriend; and Geoffrey has decided to swear off love altogether. Over the course of the night, each will explore the hard questions they face, and try to decide if it's possible to meet someone, fall in love, and get married in less time than it takes to get to the World Series.
