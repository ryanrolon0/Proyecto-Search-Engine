Uncondition

 Ned is a quiet man with a very difficult family. His young new wife is a shrew who may or may not be having an affair with a gay man. His daughter is trying to date the town's bad boy, or perhaps she'll settle for her best friend. And his son arrives back from school so detached that he doesn't even notice the dead body in the living room.
