Sleepy-Time Squirrel

 Barney is settling in for the winter, but first he needs to chop some wood. Unfortunately, that wood includes the home of Johnny Squirrel. Barney offers to let Johnny sleep in his house, but like a little kid, Johnny seems intent on doing everything but sleep, much to Barney's annoyance.
