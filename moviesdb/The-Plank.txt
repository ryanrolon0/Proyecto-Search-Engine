The Plank

 This is a pantomime about two construction workers, who discover that a plank is missing from the floor they are just building. They discover that two children have taken the plank and use it for a seesaw. Instead of taking it back, they decide to go and buy a new one. However, this may not have been a very good idea, for all the troubles and problems they encounter, just by buying a plank, are countless.
