The Moral

 A twelve years old brother tries to teach his younger brother what happens when people jump to conclusions, what happens when we see only a fragment of somebody's life, and yet judge him or her or even ourselves unfairly. He tells the story of Jake. It all begins with Jake stuck in the closet. We can't see Jake, we can only hear him. What began as an innocent exploring is about to turn into a nightmare, a horrible crime is about to happen. Jake sees everything through the crack under the doors. Despite fears, Jakes makes the decision to come to the rescue. The closet doors open, and... Jake, as well as the audience, are faced with a big surprise! One thing for sure - everyone will laugh, and hopefully we won't jump to conclusions any more.
