 Tsujimoto Natsumi, a powerful young cop with a penchant for daredevil motorcycle riding, is teamed on her first day of work with another rookie, Kobayakawa Miyuki, a whiz of a mechanic and hell on wheels with a car. While the impulsive Natsumi and the quieter Miyuki don't seem to have anything in common at first, they soon learn that they compliment each other well on the job. In short, they become the perfect team to chase the bad guys down, where ever they appear in Tokyo.
