Stripteaser II

 Out among the flesh peddlers and the vice palaces of the Sunset Strip, street-tough cabdriver Rick is looking for his kid sister. A few weeks back she vanished into the neon lit world of LA's steamiest strip clubs. His search for his sister becomes more desperate as he discovers a dark world of power and intrigue lurking beneath the city's lurid glow. Will he find her before she disappears forever? Nothing can stop him until he does.
