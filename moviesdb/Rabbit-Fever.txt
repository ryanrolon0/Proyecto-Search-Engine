Rabbit Fever

 You've heard of dog and horse shows, but are you familiar with the fascinating world of rabbit showing? For the first time ever, this 100-year-old society is revealed. Rabbit Fever follows a colorful collection of competitors as they strive to win the top title at the 2005 National American Rabbit Convention - an event that draws more than 20,000 rabbits in one building, the largest mass of rabbits in the world. While adult members of the rabbit habit compete for 'Best in Show', the teenage enthusiasts quest for an even more coveted honor in the rabbit community - Rabbit King and Queen.
