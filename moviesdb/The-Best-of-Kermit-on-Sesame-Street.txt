The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street

 Kermit is being awarded the Frog of The Year award, presented by grover. Grover first recites a long poem about frogs, which introduces various Kermit The Frog segments from Sesame Street, while being interrupted by the three little pigs, who are there because Kermit introduced them twice on Sesame Street News.
