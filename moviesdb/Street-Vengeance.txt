Street Vengeance

 A vicious trio of cocaine suppliers (led by the "crazy" Carl) strongarm their customers to purchase their drugs at high prices. When one of their misdeeds get noticed by the cops, Carl's brother eventually becomes a fatality... and Carl vows vengeance on the offending policeman, Ben St. Clair called by his boss as "The Cowboy." Allison, the daughter of Ben's partner, falls in with this bad criminal crowd, after being seduced by Tony, the remaining other hood.
