Simon, Avraam and Yosif

 The film is devoted to the 50th anniversary of the saving of the Bulgarian Jews from Nazi genocide. The author looks in on the lives of three of his contemporaries a 79-year-old rabbi; Iossif (Joseph) Surchadzhiev -a 49-year-old actor. The structure resembles three shorts united by the leitmotif of the preservation of human dignity in spite of life's vicissitudes.
