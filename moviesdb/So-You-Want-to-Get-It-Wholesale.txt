So You Want to Get It Wholesale

 Joe is urged to buy a new kitchen stove through a friend of his that can get it at the wholesale (dealer) price. He gives away his old over-range and sets out for the wholesalers. After much passing of money to a shady dealer of stoves, Joe winds up in court where he is fined for buying a stolen stove. He then has to buy back his old stove he had given away.
