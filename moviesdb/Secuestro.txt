Secuestro

 Naschy plays a member of a kidnapping gang in a story inspired by the famous Patricia Hearst case. The frightened and psychologically traumatized kidnapped woman, played by Maria Jose Cantudo, succumbs to the "Stockholm Syndrome," in which the victimized become sympathetic to the victimizer. The Naschy character, more humane than the other members of his gang, becomes the recipient of her affections. One of the rarest of Naschy films.
