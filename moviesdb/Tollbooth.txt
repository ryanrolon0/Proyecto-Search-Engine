Tollbooth

 The upscale Cawley family are slowly getting torn apart from within. Evelyn Cawley focuses on her seven year old daughter who is in private school, and suspects her County Investigator husband named Richard of cheating on her. After moving to a new town, Evelyn befriends a mysterious tollbooth operator to the chagrin of her husband. When women who look like Evelyn start turning up dead at the hands of a serial killer, time is running out on the Cawley family.
