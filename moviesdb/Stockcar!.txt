Stockcar!

 A look at NASCAR Grand National stock car racing circa 1976-7. The stars include Richard Petty, David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, Bobby Allison, and Buddy Baker, and includes upstart female racer Janet Guthrie. The sport in the mid-1970s was undergoing a surge of national popularity after Petty and Pearson crashed fighting for the win within sight of the checkered flag of the 1976 Daytona 500, telecast live on ABC Sports, and the surging interest triggered renewed media interest in the sport.
