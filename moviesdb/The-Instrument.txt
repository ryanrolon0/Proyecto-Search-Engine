The Instrument

 Seven students inherit the instrument-building workshop of their enigmatic mentor and must undergo a collective rite of passage based on the spiritual components of music. In order to fully claim their inheritance, the students must live together for one month, and learn to participate in these seven diverse musical rituals. Throughout their journey, the students rely on the meditative practices taught by their mentor -- namely, the power of Silence -- and they use this spiritual practice to guide them through the collective rite of passage. But when the rituals take a dark turn, the workshop becomes a magnifying glass for the fantasies and anxieties hidden in the human mind.
