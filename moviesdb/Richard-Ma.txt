Richard Ma

 RICHARD MA ACTIONMAKER is an improvised, cinema verite-style film about a real person obsessed with transforming himself into a fictional character in a Hollywood blockbuster. The very real Richard Ma is a leading man looking for something to lead, a stoic, heroic Kung-fu dynamo wasting his talent in the dull routines of the real world. But all that is about to change. He's written a film script and enlisted his best friend as director. He's on the way to securing a large budget with the help of insurance fraud and loan sharks. And he knows his martial art moves will rock audiences around the world.
