The Killing Time

 John York is a skilled hitman looking to find solace in his later life. He's considered the best there is. When mob boss Tony Burnet hires him to kill his ex-girlfriend turned informant, Jessica Walters, and her teenage daughter, John discovers he may become a target himself once he finishes the job. Realizing he has no loyalty from his boss of nineteen years, John takes it upon himself to protect the very people he was hired to kill. Now on the run from the mob, they flee into the woods where a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. A symbiotic relationship forms when John and Jessica realize they need each other to survive, and an all out battle ensues with enough shell casings spent to eliminate our need to free arms. Tell the funeral home to clear some space because the mob quickly finds out if you mess with John York, you end up six feet under.
