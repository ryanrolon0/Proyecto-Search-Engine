Prescription for Percy

 Little Roquefort, a mouse living in a drugstore, is prepared to have a good time while the store is closed. Before he has a chance to eat his elaborately-concocted sundae, Precy, the cat, starts chasing him. The two have a battle that uses all of the merchandise in the drugstore as props. Roquefort, with the aid of some vanishing-cream, cause havoc for the cat, and finally ejects him from the store, and leaves himself in charge of the soda-fountain delights.
