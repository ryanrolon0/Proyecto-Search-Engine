Shadows of Sepulveda

 A failed dancer takes her own life when her Hollywood dream does not manifest. Instead of her soul continuing to the afterlife it travels into the bodies of two other women on the brink of self destruction. It's a tale of the people living on the other side of the bright lights of Hollywood.
