The River Under the City of Angels

 The River Under the City of Angels documents the struggle of activists to revitalize the channelized river. Paving the river is implicated in most of the environmental problems the city is famous for. I documented my daily walks along the concrete banks of the river for three months, during that time I became aware of the profound affects the river has had on my life. While interviewing experts about the about the revitalization of the river it became apparent that restoring the river may heal many of the city's problems.
