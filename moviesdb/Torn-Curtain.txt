Torn Curtain

 U.S. rocket scientist Michael Armstrong and his assistant/fiancEe Sarah Sherman are attending a convention in Copenhagen. Michael is acting very suspiciously and Sarah follows him to East Germany when he apparently tries to defect to the other side. American scientist Michael Armstrong defects to Eastern Europe, followed by his reluctant fiancEe Sarah Sherman. It's no surprise to learn that the defection is not genuine, and that his real mission is to steal a secret mathematical formula from a professor in Leipzig. While traveling by ship to a convention in Copenhagen, the reluctant Professor Michael Armstrong is pressed by his fiancEe and assistant, Sarah Sherman, to discuss a possible schedule to their marriage. Later in the Hotel D' Angleterre, Sarah sees Armstrong receiving a plane ticket and he explains that he needs to go to Stockholm. However, the snoopy Sarah discovers that he is indeed flying to East Berlin with Professor Karl Manfred who is also attending the convention, so she decides to follow him.
