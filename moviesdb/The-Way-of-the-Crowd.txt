The Way of the Crowd

 The most comprehensive documentary ever made on the Northern Soul scene. A dynamic insight into why this music meant so much to so many. Geno Washington, Paul Smith, Keb Darge and many more lead us through their experience and the impact it had on the people, the power to be someone, to dance like we have never seen before or since!
