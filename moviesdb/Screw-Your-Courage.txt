Screw Your Courage

 In Screw Your Courage, young African-Americans who've dropped out of high school try to get their lives back on track with an unusual project for their impoverished Oakland, CA neighborhood. After spending their days doing hard labor at minimum wage, they transform into bloody-handed kings and queens with a performance of William Shakespeare's Macbeth.
