Useless Things

 Shashin is a young second generation immigrant struggling to find his identity following the loss of his parents. We follow his thoughts about his chosen path, memories of his family, and dreams of Hindu mythology. As he goes through boxes Shashin begins to find meaning in the seemingly insignificant odds and ends that fill the cold house that once was his home. Taking us backward and forward in time to follow his memories, Useless Things is a dreamily crafted journey of forgiveness, enlightenment, and self-discovery.
