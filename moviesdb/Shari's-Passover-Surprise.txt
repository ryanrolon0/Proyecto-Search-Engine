Shari's Passover Surprise

 Trouble brews as Charlie Horse's campaign for class president leads him to invite the whole class to Shari's for Passover... a fact he conveniently forgets to pass on to Shari until the eleventh hour. Meanwhile, everyone else is getting in on the action... Dom Deluise gets an education on the Seder plate and the significance of each item it holds, and neighbor Robert Guillaume delivers a song and dance explanation of the history of Passover.
