Shockumentary

 Horror movie freak Danny Demon has a cameraman shoot behind the scenes footage on the set of his latest film "Curse of The Strang-Mutilator" (First the Killer strangles his victims, then the Killer mutilates his victims"). But when the crew is killed off one by one, the cheesy b-movie becomes reality T.V.
