 Elliot and Danny are two childhood friends who chose the wrong way to grow up. They have been involved in gang activities under the Gang-lord, Biggie. Elliot feels it fine to be doing what they are doing, but Danny has personal problems. Danny, Darryl and Spoon rob a bank under the command of Biggie. Danny drops off Darryl and Spoon and decides to grab a bite at a burger bar leaving the 6 million they just had robbed from the bank, in the getaway car - or at least, that would be Danny's version of story to Biggie about the missing money. Biggie's henchmen beat him up and tries to find the truth. The ruthless Biggie decides to give Elliot a chance to get his money out of Danny. They drive to a isolated spot in California and gets into a personal conversation. It is here that Elliot finds out where the missing money is at and what Danny has intended to do with it.
