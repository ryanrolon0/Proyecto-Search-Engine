Spider's Walk

 A lonely spider crawls through an attic window on dark and stormy night. Inside he discovers an old rag doll on the attic floor. After a moment of debate, he cuts the spine of the doll and burrows his way inside. Possessed by the spider, the doll rises to its feet and wanders off to explore a new life.
