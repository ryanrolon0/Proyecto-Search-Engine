The Teahouse of the August Moon

 A satire on America's very own drive of a world changer world war ii, Captain Fisby is sent to the village Tobiki in Okinawa to teach the people democracy. First step is to build a school - but the witty folks know what they really want. They tell him about their culture and traditions - and persuade him to build something they really want teahouse. Fisby has a hard time to break this to his superiors.
