The 3 Little Wolfs

 Why is this night different from all other nights? It's Passover at the Wolf house... and it may be their last! Join the three Wolf brothers as they navigate a breezy spring New York City day, culminating in an obligatory visit home to Long Island where their mother Sarah (Tovah Feldshuh), a natural incendiary with the tenacity of a cold sore, awaits them. Also awaiting them, a Seder for the ages, more eventful than the Last Supper. Well maybe not quite that eventful. A slice-of-life comedy, THE 3 LITTLE WOLFS centers on the three Wolf brothers (ages 26-31) and their overbearing, yet well-intentioned mother, Sarah (Tovah Feldshuh). The story unfolds as the Wolf family and friends gather at Sarah's home on Long Island for their annual Passover seder to commemorate their ancestors' 40-year odyssey across Egypt's deserts... which compared to this eventful evening, seems like a walk in the park.
