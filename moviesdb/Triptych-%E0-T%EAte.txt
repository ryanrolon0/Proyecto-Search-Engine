Triptych-à-Tête

 A three-part short film about writing and literature. Together, the individual pieces make up a story greater than the sum of its parts. The first part, 'The Gamble' tells the story of a writer plagued with writer's block. When confronted by the mysterious Mr. Block himself with an offer to win the rest of his book in a game of 'simple blackjack,' the writer must choose carefully - for the more he loses, the more he begins to unwrite his story. The second part, 'The Executioner,' introduces Chairman Wales - a colorful CEO who has seen to it that art (unless it has been made solely for entertainment) has been made illegal. Muses are now criminals and forced to stand trial at the foot of Wales's lovely pet - a 19th century French guillotine. They only lack one piece of evidence to proceed - a witness testimony. The final part, 'The Celebration,' tells the story of two kingly brothers who jointly rule over their lands as ghostwriters, dictating the voice of their people. When a woman is discovered who has written her own book, the brothers engage in a rivalry to make her their queen.
