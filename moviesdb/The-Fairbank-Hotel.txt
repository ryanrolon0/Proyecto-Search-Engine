The Fairbank Hotel

 A recreation of the tone and ambience of a 1940s black and white Film Noir classic; but set within a contemporary context. The primary theme explores the potentially corrosive nature of money within relationships as well as relationships themselves as commodity. Through acerbic dialogue and witty banter, a husband and wife's romantic weekend away slowly reveals their mutual exploitation of each other in pursuit of wealth and emotional manipulation. Still, through this undercurrent of frustration slides the awareness that real feelings still exist between them, but both play a never-ending game of emotional tug of war when a bag full of money is mistakenly delivered to their hotel room.
