Relative Dysfunction

 Jordyn is trapped in modern suburban Hell. Fleeing the neglect of her parents, she tries to find her own voice and her own crowd. She runs with a wild crowd and when the depression follows her into her new life she self-medicates against it, resorting finally to a life of thievery and prostitution when the money runs out.
