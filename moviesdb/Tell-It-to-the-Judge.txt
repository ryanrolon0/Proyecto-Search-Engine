Tell It to the Judge

 Marsha Meredith, an attorney-at-law, is nominated for a Federal judgeship, but her nomination is opposed by a 'Good-Government' group who think her divorce makes her unfit for the job. This evolves into situations, happening in Flordia, New England, Washington D.C. and the Adirondacks, such as the misunderstood husband trying to win back his wife, and the misunderstood wife trying to make her husband jealous, and one case of mistaken identity after another, after another. Attorney Pete Webb and Marsha Meredith Webb, up for an appointment as a federal court judge, have just gotten divorced. The divorce was based on a misunderstanding of impropriety between Pete and a female witness, Ginger Simmons, in a case involving the mob. The divorce is also causing Marsha problems in that her appointment is being challenged by some in the senate who believe her divorce makes her unfit for the position. Pete still loves Marsha and will do anything to get her back. However, he is still working on the mob related case, and further misunderstandings may ensue with Ginger still in the picture. Also, Marsha's grandfather, retired Judge MacKenzie Meredith, will do anything to make sure Marsha's appointment gets approved, even if it means keeping Pete and Marsha apart. Between the truths, half truths and full out lies Pete and Marsha tell to advance their causes - especially those told to a scandal hungry media - a playboy gambler named Alexander Darvac and an elderly lighthouse keeper named Alonso K. Roogle are added to the mix to complicate matters.
