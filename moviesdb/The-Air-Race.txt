The Air Race

 Willie tells a whopper! When Willie sees that his friends are impressed by a poster advertising an upcoming air show, he tells them that he was once a pilot in an air race. We see Willie outmaneuver the other competitors until only he and another racer are left, attempting to sabotage one another to the finish.
