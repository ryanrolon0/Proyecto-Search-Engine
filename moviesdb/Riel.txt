Riel

 This film recounts the events involving the Metis rebel leader Louis Riel and his battles against the Canadian Federal Government when they threatened his people. The first was a successful rebellion in 1873 which created the Province of Manitoba and a later more violent and unsuccessful one in Saskatchewan in 1885 which led to his capture, trial and eventual execution.
