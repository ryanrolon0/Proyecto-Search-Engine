Tunnel of Love

 A man is riding through a tunnel on his very old but desirable motorbike. He comes into a city, impressing a girl in a cabriolet with his bike. At the traffic light, she darts away, while his engine stops. Frustrated, the man goes into a bar. but then the girl drives by. This time, he reaches her and they do a mating dance with their machines. The next morning, when he wakes up, she is gone with the bike, playing the same game he did the day before with a young man in a Jeep.
