She's So Cold

 The gossip between three government office clerks over the relationship between a mysterious woman, her deceased sister, and the madman loved by both women takes a twist in its implications when the clerks discover a photograph left behind by said mysterious woman after visiting their office. "She's So Cold" is a psychological musical noir drama which takes place at a government office set in a dystopian future. The request of a mysterious woman (Robin Reck) to view the videotaped confession of a madman (Angel Connell) sets off fierce gossip among three office clerks (Jeff Corveau, Robert Jodka, and Eric Scheiner) over the nature of the woman's relationship with said madman and the woman's deceased sister (Zenobia). When the woman abruptly leaves the office after listening to the taped confession, she accidentally leaves behind a photograph. When found by the clerks, said photograph hints at further complications suggested by their gossip - including intimations of incest, murder, and necrophilia.
