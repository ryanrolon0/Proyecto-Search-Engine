Songs from the Wood

 Songs from the Wood, tells its mytho-poetic tale of life and death with no words. The haunting music of Aerietober sets the mood of mystery. These bare woods have only two residents, but all of us may pass through here on our way to whatever may be next. The hunter (Alan Meyer) and the dog (Maggie)may be merely the servants of this gray woodland bordering beyond. Like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, this is a place of no easy answers.
