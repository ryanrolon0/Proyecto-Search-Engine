Safe Delivery

 As Liberia recovers from civil war, health workers and midwives are in short supply. When village women give birth, they are usually helped by a traditional birth attendant from their own community. This film tells the story of a training programme, developed by the Liberian Ministry of Health and the ICRC, to improve the skills of traditional birth attendants. When the participants complete the course, they know how to help with normal deliveries and when to send women with problems to the nearest health centre.
