Under the Counter Spy

 This cartoon is a parody of the then current TV show, "Dragnet". Police are warned of an escaped criminal, "The Bat", who possesses a super strength tonic. He hides the tonic in Woody's house hoping to retreive it the next day. When the listless Woody awakes, he imbibes the tonic, giving him the strength of twenty men which he immediately tests. Eventually, "The Bat" lures Woody to his hideout in hopes of retrieving his bottle, resulting in a man-to-man (bat?) showdown between Woody and "The Bat". This parody of television's "Dragnet" (with its Joe Friday detective) finds police-detective Thursday being alerted to be on the lookout for a dangerous spy, The Bat, who has stolen a secret formula potion. He hides the secret solution in Woody Woodpecker's house. Woody awakens and drinks the potion and gains super strength and captures the Bat. But the effects wear off before he can turn the criminal over to Detective Thursday, and Woody is scorned by the emotionless policeman.
