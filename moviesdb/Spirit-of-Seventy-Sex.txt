Spirit of Seventy Sex

 If Martha Washington looked like luscious star Annette Haven, our history books would probably read like the "Kama Sutra." Spirit of Seventy Sex is a playful, tongue-in-cheek romp backward in time, but giant steps forward in eroticism. It's a costume piece with wardrobe mostly from the Garden of Eden. Annette Haven is outrageously beautiful and maddeningly alluring, and even if this outstandingly humorous and sexy movie was filmed two centuries ago, it would still be a hit.
