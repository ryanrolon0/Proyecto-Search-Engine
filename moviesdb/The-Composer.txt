The Composer

 THE COMPOSER, a true-life story based on one man's creative struggle through his triumphant journey, which propelled him into fighting when challenged by aggressive forces. This story takes place in Olympic city of Sarajevo, a city referred by many as the Jerusalem of Europe during the four-year-long siege of the early 1990s. Facing a brutal enemy intent on extinguishing the soul and culture of his people, an artist must choose to lay down his baton and take up a rifle. Armed with little more than fierce love of country and their spiritual unity, he and his fellow citizens, Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike, confront the aggressors head-on while the world stood by. His experience reshapes his identity and clarifies his mission - to trade-in his rifle for a conductor's baton in order to promote unity on earth by awaking the spirit of humanity through the universal language of music. The melody and the compelling act of collective spiritual unity is the conspiring essence of the power that drove the outlook to accomplish the impossible, which few could only discover. Was the composer able to overcome the insurmountable odds, or did he fall victim to the war that surrounded his artistic soul.
