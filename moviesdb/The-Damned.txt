The Damned

 Huntsville Texas is the uncrowned jailhouse capital of the USA. In the famous 'walls unit' in the center of the city, by far the most executions in the whole of the U.S. are being enforced. Many of the executed prisoners are buried at the nearby jail cemetery. Here those are buried, who died penniless in jail and whose families did not claim their bodies. This cemetery is the starting point for a hard look at this very contradictory small Texan town.
