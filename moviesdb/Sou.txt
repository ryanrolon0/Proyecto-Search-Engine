Sou

 "Sou" means "noise" in Japanese and "manic depression" in Chinese. A plane takes off. Then, with pulsating music as the soundtrack, comes a mix of animation and documentary footage suggesting the seductive, if noisy and manic, quality of Japan. Images of food and words come and go against other images of flowers and abstract design. The man and woman - seen mainly as a line drawing of faces in profile - float through all.
