Una parte de mi vida

 A part of my life tells about one day in the life of Camila Sepulveda. She is a young girl who works as a prostitute with three other friends in a rented apartment downtown Santiago, Chile. It is through their private conversations that we get to know their lives beyond their work. To see their struggle to get through the days as young single mothers, as well their desire to make it and give their children a brighter future.
