Sleepless Nights

 In 1981, exploitation king Roger Corman hired Amy Holden-Jones to produce and direct a script by "Rubyfruit Jungle" author Rita Mae Brown. The union beget THE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE (1982),the world's first "feminist" slasher film. Its success led to a trilogy ('87/'90) and featured popular TV and b-movie film actresses Crystal Bernard, Brinke Stevens, Maria Ford and Hope Marie Carlton. 30 years later, cast and crew of the trilogy gather to discuss the ups-and-downs of independent film-making, the requirements of nudity, sex & violence, just how feminist the series really is, and what it was like to work for Corman during the decadent 1980s.
