The Meatrix

 Moopheus the Cow finds Leo the Pig at a family farm and informs him that corporations are taking over the way farms used to be. By taking the blue pill, Leo can remain at ease in his current situation, or by taking the red pill, Leo can see just how far the rabbit hole goes. Of course, he chooses the red pill, and so continues the spoof of "The Matrix" (1999), complete with techno music, fake motion control camera movements and completely blank environments from which gun racks (or in this case, pigs) shoot out. Seeing these animals wear sunglasses and trench coats is priceless, but the information the movie gives on factory farming is far more significant.
