Society and Chaps

 Rich as the result of a lucky mining strike, Jack Farleigh married Bessie Evans. He did not remain contented with idleness very long, and when Bessie invited some dear friends to visit her, Jack fled in disgust to the ranch, where Mexican Joe and the cowboys soon made him at home once more. Bessie and her friends went touring. An automobile mishap brought Jack to the rescue--also it led to some mighty funny adventures for the auto party, when Jack as a highwayman held up his own friends in his own automobile.
