Preston's View

 When a lonely apartment janitor witnesses a woman murdered in broad daylight, he enlists the help of her voyeuristic neighbor to spy on the other tenants and track down her supposed killer. But as they become enmeshed in the lives of these strangers around them and the suspect list continues to grow, a horrifying secret is uncovered -- this apartment complex is not what it appears to be.
