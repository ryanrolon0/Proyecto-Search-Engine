The Brixtonian

 Satire about class in the spoof documentary form, The Brixtonian describes the world of an upper-class white trustafarian who thinks he's a rasta. The mock doc and white guys who think they are black may seem old hat now, but this short actually pre-dates Ali G by a couple of years.
