The Ship of Theseus

 A blind photographer, celebrated for her intuitive excellence, successfully captures the essence of her experience in her photography. She loses her genius when she gains sight after a cornea transplant. She begins to come to terms with the loss of her art, as she moves on to experience the world first hand. A monk, wed to his vow of non-violence and active against inhumane treatment to animals, is forced to make a choice between death and medicine - medicine that is either derived from, or tested on animals. As death closes in, he re-questions all the ideas that he has always taken for granted. A young stock broker has a frictional relationship with his grandmother, whom he nurses in a hospital. When it is discovered that a neighbouring patient has had his kidney stolen, he starts out on a trail that leads him to a kidney tourism racket. Altruism and concern lead him further to the recipient of the kidney, living in Sweden.
