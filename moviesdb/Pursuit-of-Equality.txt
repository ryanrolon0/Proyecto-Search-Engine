Pursuit of Equality

 Pursuit of Equality is an emotionally charged film that puts a face on American citizens who strive for marriage equality. This documentary takes you on a 'behind the scenes' journey into the most controversial civil rights issue of our time. By issuing marriage licenses to same gender couples, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom uproots the status quo and attempts to change the way the nation looks at life, love, and marriage. Pursuit of Equality was filmed over 15 months - from the first same gender Marriage performed at City Hall through the thousands of marriages celebrated in San Francisco, to the protests and the Supreme Court orders that stopped the weddings and voided the marriages through to Superior Court Judge Kramer's landmark ruling that it is unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses to same gender couples.
