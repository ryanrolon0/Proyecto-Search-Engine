Som en familie

 Sami owns a pizzeria but wishes to open a family restaurant with his brother Halim. Halim has just finished high-school (gymnasium) but he wants to continue his education. Hence he doesn't show up to sign for the loan at the bank. Sami is very angry, and when he realizes Halim is planning to go to Paris to study for architect he becomes furious - because he cannot open a family restaurant without his family. And he is too old to take an education of his own. So he tries to stop Halim...
