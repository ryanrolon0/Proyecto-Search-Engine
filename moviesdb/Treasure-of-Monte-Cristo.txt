Treasure of Monte Cristo

 This modern tale borrows from an old story in establishing Langan, who works on a ship that docks in San Francisco, as a descendant of the Count of Monte Cristo. Crooked Lawyer Brodie sets up a scheme to get at the treasure of Langan's famed ancestor, and using the beautiful blonde Jergens, tries to lure Langan into a trap. Langan proves worthy of his heritage, using a gun instead of a sword, and wins legitimately both his forturne and Jergens. Seaman Edmund Dante, a descendant of the Count of Monte Cristo, arrives in San Francisco and is immediately slugged, and then has to fight off some thugs who are trying to adduct Jean Turner. This is a set-up, as the gang is after the fabulous treasure that belonged to Dante's ancestor, and is now somewhere in San Francisco and the gang thinks Dante knows where. Jean, gives him a wild story that leads him to marrying her "in name only,", and he soon finds himself involved in a murder.
