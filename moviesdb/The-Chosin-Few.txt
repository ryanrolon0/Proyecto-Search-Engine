The Chosin Few

 During the battle, a group of 2,500 undertrained and ill-equipped U.S. Army soldiers, along with 15,000 Marines, fought back against the surprise attack of more than 100,000 Chinese troops. After several days of fighting in subzero temperatures, the efforts of the soldiers allowed the Marines to battle their way out.
