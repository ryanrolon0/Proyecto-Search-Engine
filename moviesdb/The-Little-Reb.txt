The Little Reb

 A scene taken from the war play "Winchester," about to be placed upon the stage, in which the heroine is carrying a pardon to her lover, who is condemned to be shot. As she comes into view, mounted on a fleet horse, a soldier suddenly appears at the bend in the road and starts in pursuit of the girl. He overtakes her after they have galloped about half a mile, and as he endeavors to lift her from her horse she thrusts a revolver in his face and fires, when he falls heavily to the ground from his running horse, and the heroine, accompanied by the rider-less horse of the spy, passes out of the foreground of the picture. Both life-size. Very realistic, and sure to become very popular.
