Tales of a Highway

 "Tales of a Highway" explores the impacts of the A1 highway that runs from Amsterdam to Germany. A young Dutch woman interviews local residents in central Holland, searching for clues as to where her grandparent's farm house once stood. She suspects the house was destroyed by the building of the highway, but finds clues in the landscape as to where it might have been. In a parallel story, a group of engineers, architects, and artists explore the cultural and ecological impacts of the highway. They propose ways in which the highway can better integrated with local culture and the environment.
