The Yellow Rose of Texas

 Insurance Investigator Roy is looking for Weston and the missing money he supposedly obtained in a robbery. When he catches him and listens to his story, he changes his mind about him. A freak accident locates the missing money box and they find the seal unbroken. Roy then announces the box will be opened at the showboat that evening. Dale's father has broken out of jail where is doing time for a supposed robbery five years earlier. Roy is an insurance investigator working undercover on Dale's showboat, the "Yellow Rose of Texas." He believes her father will eventually come to the show boat to get the money from the robbery. Songs include "Dowm Mexico Way," "Show Boat," "Take It Easy," "Down in the Old Town Hall," and the title song.
