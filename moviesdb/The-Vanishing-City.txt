The Vanishing City

 Global trends in major cities around the world have changed rapidly in the last several decades. As cities become more interconnected, and less dependent on localized economic models, domestic issues of increased class inequality and sustainability have emerged as central components to city planning debates. These trends are perhaps best exemplified in the city of New York. Told through the eyes of city planners, developers, politicians, small business owners, landlords and tenants, the recent development boom in New York City is analyzed through a mix of archival footage, interviews, and personal stories. Issues of class formation, land use, rezoning decisions and the upheaval of longstanding neighborhoods combine to provide a critical look into the deeply rooted policies of one of the worlds most iconic cities.
