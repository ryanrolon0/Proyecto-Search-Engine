Toulouse La Trick

 A notorious Paris criminal, Toulouse Le Moose, escapes to Cherbourg after jumping bail, and Inspector Clouseau is assigned to handcuff himself to Toulouse and accompany him by train back to Paris. Toulouse smashes Clouseau's gun and escapes the train, dragging his handcuffed captive, Clouseau, behind him. The two are anxious to part company if they can find a way of breaking their metal links.
