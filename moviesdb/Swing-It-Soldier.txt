Swing It Soldier

 Jerry Traynor, an Army conscriptee (peace-time draftee), is released from the service, and returns to his job as a radio executive, after promising his army-buddy, Bill Walters, to look out after his wife, Evelyn, who, although expecting a baby, is also pursuing a singing career in radio. He mistakes Evelyn's twin sister, Patricia, for the wife whose welfare he is to guard and, in attempting to do so, cause more complications than can be handled in only sixty-six minutes of running time, with time-out for ten musical numbers.
