Stitches

 Jolene is wanted for the murder of a state trooper. Bullet wound in her stomach, she must do whatever it takes to get a passport to cross the border to Canada. Innocent hostage, Maggie, is forced to aid Jolene as they inch closer to the Malmo Motel, where a passport is waiting. Here, Jolene finds that the price has doubled, and reluctantly tells Maggie to drive to the nearest shop, shotgun in hand.
