Ruby & Lilly

 Ruby is sensitive and clever. Lilly is impetuous and supportive. They're both broke and out of work. In this first installment of Ruby & Lilly's Big Apple Adventures, shot almost entirely in Brooklyn, New York and with a soundtrack provided by The Moonlighters, Ruby and Lilly show us that necessity really is the mother of invention.
