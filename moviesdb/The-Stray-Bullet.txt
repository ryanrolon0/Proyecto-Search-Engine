The Stray Bullet

 Recently fired from his job, David decides the best way to leave his mark and not be forgotten is to flash his office. On his way, in only a trench coat, Shauna pays for David's bus fair because he left his wallet and phone at home, in his pants. Smitten with Shauna's generosity, David talks to her and soon learns that she is the one replacing him at his old job. David's old boss (Shauna's new one) Scott, a drug dealer, hits on Shauna and becomes enraged when he finds out her interests lie with David. Other layered stories include a cameraman that wants to go blind, a man who cannot stop masturbating in phone booths and a boy who learns the art of thievery.
