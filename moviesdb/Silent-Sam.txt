Silent Sam

 Sam Ramirez is a veteran cop in the NYPD with very little to talk to about. On a routine stake out, a drug deal goes bad; and he is forced to put his gun to work. Fellow officers soon learn that Ramirez killed Mob Boss Vince Gallo's brother, in revenge for the death of his partner. Now with a Mob contract on his head, and the police wanting him for murder, Ramirez must navigate the shadows of betrayal between the mob enforcers and the police; in a desperate attempt to stay alive and keep a promise to his dead partner. Compelled to fight, Sam's silence is broken by the sound of his gun.
