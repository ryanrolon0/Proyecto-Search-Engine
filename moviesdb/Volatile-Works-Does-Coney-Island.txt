Volatile Works Does Coney Island

 Hurry hurry step this way! The MontrEal-based film collective Volatile Works pillages the public domain Prelinger archives, sampling and remixing archival footage from the heyday of Coney Island. Six remixes create a cinematic funhouse mirror of carnival themes and collective memories, from the freaks, dancing girls and beauty queens that define us all, to the playfulness and poignancy of amusement park nostalgia. A taste of the marvelous freaks you'll see for the price of a small thin dime! If you hurry, hurry, hurry!
