The Apache Kid's Escape

 After escaping from Sheriff Lang, the Apache Kid takes a job on the Wilson ranch as Jim. Wilson's hand Ted Conway uses the kerchief given him by Jim and robs the stage. But his Apache Kid impersonation fails and he is jailed. Jim's job now is to set Ted straight, return the gold, and put the Apache Kid name to rest. Following a narrow escape from the sheriff, the Apache Kid takes up the romantic problems of Ted Conway, who has just been informed by Frank Conway that Ted is not his son but an orphan picked up on the plains after his parents were killed in an Indian attack. Rancher Larry Wilson rejects Ted's request to marry his daughter, Jane, and accepts Frank Conway's offer to destroy his mortgage note, that Frank holds, and pay a large sum of money in return for Jane's hand in marriage. The Kid clears Ted of a stagecoach robbery, pulled by Frank, obtains the note for Wilson, throws the pursuing sheriff off his trail, and moves on to clear his own name of a false charge.
