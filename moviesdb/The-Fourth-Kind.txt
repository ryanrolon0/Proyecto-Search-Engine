The Fourth Kind

 In 1972, a scale of measurement was established for alien encounters. When a UFO is sighted, it is called an encounter of the first kind. When evidence is collected, it is known as an encounter of the second kind. When contact is made with extraterrestrials, it is the third kind. The next level, abduction, is the fourth kind. Modern-day, Alaska, where-mysteriously since the 1960s-a disproportionate number of the population has been reported missing every year. Despite multiple FBI investigations of the region, the truth has never been discovered. Here in this remote region, psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented. The Fourth Kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses. Their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical details, the validity of which is investigated throughout the film. After the mysterious death of her beloved husband in Nome, Alaska, the psychologist Abigail Emily Tyler decides to proceed his research with clients that have insomnia and amnesia after seeing a white owl. When she uses hypnosis with two clients, they have nervous breakdown and violent attitudes with their discoveries, but they do not disclose what they have recalled. When Abbey finds that she had also seen the owl, she pushes herself to the edge with tragic consequences.
