The Last Steamship

 A feature-length documentary which delves into the infamous history of the luxurious SS City of Medicine Hat, a 130 ft steamship which met her untimely end on June 7th, 1908 when she crashed into the newly constructed Traffic Bridge in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and sank to the bottom of the swiftly flowing river. One hundred years later, after the happenstance discovery of the ship's anchor by Saskatoon Fire & Protective Services divers, a full-scale underwater excavation was launched in an endeavor to locate artifacts from the ship and attempt to piece together the story of the last steamship to ever embark upon the waters of the South Saskatchewan. And now, you're invited to come onboard and join the search!
