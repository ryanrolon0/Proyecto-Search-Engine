The Ruby Ring

 Young Lucy McLaughlin's father has lost his job and to help make ends meet she is sent to live with her Grandmother. To help her get over her loss, the old lady gives Lucy a magic ring which will grant her two wishes. But as always is the case with magic, what you wish for can be twisted by the granter of the wishes into something not quite what you wished for.
