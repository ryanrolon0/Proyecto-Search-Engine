The Super Snooper

 In this parody of trench-coat detective films, Daffy Duck is Duck Drake, a "Private Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat" who receives a telephone call summoning him to the J. Cleaver Axe-Handle Estate, where a murder has supposedly taken place. Daffy/Drake arrives at a lavish house that he thinks is the murder site and suspects its occupant, an amorous lady duck, of committing the crime. As the lady duck showers him with affection, Daffy attempts to reenact the crime as he believes it happened and orders the lady duck to cooperate. In the process, Daffy is shot, crushed by a falling piano, and run over by a train, before the lady duck tells him that he came to the wrong address, that the real murder site is a house down the road, and that the only thing of which she is guilty is love for Daffy, whom she matrimonially pursues straight through her house's door and outside onto the street.
