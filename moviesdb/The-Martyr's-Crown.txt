The Martyr's Crown

 In an attempt to pass himself off as a man of distinction and prestige, the shabby but self-assured Mr.Toole has a habit of spinning a colourful tale to the more trusting of his compatriots. The Martyr's Crown is the exorbitant tall story of courage and virtue. Toole is himself the champion of his own inordinately garnished bud decoratively deliberate yarn.
