Striporama

 This is not a Documentary in any form, shape or fashion. But it is one of the very few exploitation-burlesque films that wasn't filmed with one camera from the back of a burlesque theater, and one of the even-fewer films of this genre that had a plot that was more than just a series of strippers performing in-between a series of no-talent comics interrupting the stripping. The plot here involves two burlesque fans---the whole burlesque-show and not just the strippers---reading that a university is preparing a time capsule on the arts and is not considering burlesque for inclusion. They bring film and camera to the board meeting, and force the board members to look at examples of the "art of burlesque," featuring Georgia Southern and Rosita Royce...and her well-trained birds...and the inevitable comedians. As an extra added attraction---for who-knows-who--- the 1953 "Mr. America" makes an appearance. For the "film-in-a-film" finale, nine barely-clad girls come on stage each carrying a letter that spells out 'Burlesque,' while they sing its praises. (This part looks like the usual shot-at-the-theater stuff.) Back at the University, the board members are convinced and agree to add 'Burlesque' to its tribute-to-the-arts time capsule. There is a shortened DVD version that is missing eight minutes, and one can only hope that includes the "Mr. America" footage.
