Ungirlfriendable

 Murphy Grayson can't catch a break with the ladies. It all changes during a freak explosion at work where he is endowed with the ability to allow women to see his thoughts. After failed usages of the power, he harnesses it and gets with the ladies. He soon finds these meaningless flings are merely a stepping stone to get to the person he truly wishes to be with.
