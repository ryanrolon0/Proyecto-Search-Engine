Sorcellerie culinaire

 Nothing seems to be going right for the busy cook. He has several helpers, but they are mostly talking and laughing and doing little, so, when an old beggar asks for a hand out, the harried cook boots him out. The beggar returns in his true aspect, he's a wizard, and all Hell breaks loose. An imp ruins the soup with too much spice, and the cook blames his helpers. The wizard conjures more imps, and various chases and tricks ensue as the imps pop in and out of the cook's large oven. Havoc reigns.
