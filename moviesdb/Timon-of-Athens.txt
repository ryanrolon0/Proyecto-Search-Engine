 Set in modern day San Francisco (Athens), Timon is a flamboyant playboy, who has become famous in the big city for his kinky parties, and the lavish gifts he bestows on artists, merchants and adoring friends. When Athenian Senators close in on Timon and his soldier friend, Captain Alcibiades, they quickly learn how deeply money can corrupt politics and friendship. Timon retreats to the wilderness to live as a misanthropic beast. There in the Athenian forest, Timon finds what he was least expecting too late for revenge?
