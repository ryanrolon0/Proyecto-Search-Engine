The Mighty Fortress

 A newsreel type record of the Reverend Billy Graham's 1954 Crusade for Europe in which the American Evangelist delivered his sermons, in English with interpreters, in England, Norway, Finland and Germany, and established a non-denominational world-wide base that still exists. Graham filled the stadiums in every country with his evangelical, 'old-time-camp-meetings.' Albeit, his entourage and congregation-sizes were on a scale not even dreamed of Billy Sunday.
