Real Pirates of the Caribbean

 A droning account of several famous pirates & pirate bands interspersed with commentary by several unanimated experts, featuring movie clips, still painting, & repeated video that don't really convey the dramatic & violent lifestyle that is the topic of this would-be documentary. Contrary to the suggestion of its title, this is NOT an adjunct to the Disney film it attempts to expose.
