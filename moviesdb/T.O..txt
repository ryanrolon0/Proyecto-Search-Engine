T.O.

 We begin with words. A story of the decomposition and redemption of a relationship sets the stage for the sounds, words and images that compose a personal and unique vision of of Toronto. An explosion of magic hour sunlight gives way to conversation - the moments that change the way two people feel about each other, the casual, coffee fueled description of a revelation in jazz merge together in a climax of sound, music and wild fireworks in the park. A final journey by foot forms the epilogue, looking forward toward new city.
