Song of the Kauri

 Song of the Kauri is a film from the heart of New Zealand. It speaks of the mighty Kauri tree and the human history tangled in it's roots. A vibrant and passionate journey into the soul of the people from the land of the long white cloud, the song of a Kauri guitar, Aotearoa in all its' exotic remoteness at the bottom of the South Pacific. Song of the Kauri tackles the universal politics of living on the tightrope between environmental sustainability and economic survival. One of the most important films of the year. Be prepared to ponder.
