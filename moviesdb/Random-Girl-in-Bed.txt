Random Girl in Bed

 'Random Girl in Bed' is about a guy who realizes there's a girl in his bed and he has no idea why. She wakes up, and reveals she's a 'rent-a-girlfriend' his Mom set up for him, much to his chagrin. He's still happy, though, even when she says it's a 'non-copulatory' package. He makes her dinner anyway. And he hears his brother who he lives with has someone too in the next room.
