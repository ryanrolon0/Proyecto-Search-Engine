Safe Sex

 The New York City gay scene has a toned-down look flags, and in its place are trendy, sleek bars and a more mainstream look. Brook and Jake are representatives of old stereotypes with new thinking. Brook talks about living a healthy life, but ducks in the bathroom to do drugs. Jake appears to want a relationship, but is the first to leave for a night with another man. The other man is Andre, a mysterious stranger, and we find out that Andre is not the relationship "type".
