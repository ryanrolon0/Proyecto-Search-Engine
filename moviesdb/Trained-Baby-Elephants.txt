Trained Baby Elephants

 This film is a continuation of the two listed above [A REMARKABLE GROUP OF TRAINED ANIMALS and TRAINED DOGS AND ELEPHANTS]. As it opens, a baby elephant is shown walking over the prostrate body of a pony, and this is followed by a reverse in position, the elephant lying down and the pony jumping over the elephant's body. The scene concludes with a very clever series of tricks done by one of the baby elephants, such as walking on its front and hind legs, balancing, etc.
