Too Colourful for the League

 Too Colourful For The League is a made-for-TV documentary examining the struggle of blacks in hockey from the 30's to the present day and the campaign to have Herb Carnegie elected into the Hall of Fame. Carnegie was a black superstar in the 40's and 50's who never played in the NHL because of the league's unacknowledged color bar. Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe once saw Carnegie play and said, "I'd give $10,000 to turn that boy white." The campaign is supported by Hockey hall of Famers Jean Beliveau and Red Storey, among others. In Cinema VeritE style, the documentary tells the story of black players' courage and determination to play in a white-dominated sport.
