The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown

 Laurel Srevens ('Jane Russell (I)' (qv)), a movie star is kidnapped by a pair of amateurs, Mike Valla ('Ralph Meeker' (qv)) and "Dandy" ('Keenan Wynn' (qv)). But their hearts aren't really into their work and they decide to let her go. Laurel, worried abut the effect a phoney kidnapping will have on her career, tells them they've got to go through with it for real. She points out that in the past, she's been a party to number of outrageous publicity stunts and, because they abducted her on the eve of the release of her new film, "The Kidnapped Bride," she tells them her career will collapse unless they make the kidnapping look like it was on the level.
