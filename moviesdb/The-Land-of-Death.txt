The Land of Death

 A story of ruthless doings pictured on the rolling plains with a far background of uplifted mountains. It shows us a most villainous gang of land grabbers who, to warn off all settlers, wipe out every party who crosses their country. One settler who they think disposed of, manages to join a small party in a prairie schooner. The gang are (sic) chasing this. In the running fight and in the turning at bay by the water pool, every man and every woman except hero and heroine in the party and also every man in the gang is killed. The last struggle is a hand to hand fight between Kerrigan and Richardson which the heroine with a knife decides.
