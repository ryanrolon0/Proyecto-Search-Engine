So You're Going to Be a Father

 Joe McDoakes doesn't like kids, and the neighborhood kids don't like him much either, but when his wife Alice tells him she's expecting a little visitor, it doesn't take him long before he's imagining a son who looks like his dad, goes to West Point, and becomes President. During the pregnancy, Joe gets Alice to a checkup, consults a fortune teller, takes care of Alice's midnight cravings for odd foods, and may or may not be ready for the trip to the hospital. Does it all work out as Joe imagined it would?
