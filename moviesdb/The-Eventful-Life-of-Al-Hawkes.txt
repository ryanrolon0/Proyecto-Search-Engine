The Eventful Life of Al Hawkes

 A documentary film that tells the story of Maine musician, record producer, and Bluegrass Pioneer, Al Hawkes. In 1956, Al founded the Event Records label with his wife Barbara and partner Richard Greeley. From the late 1940s through the 1950s, he created some of the most highly regarded country, Bluegrass, and rockabilly recordings - including songs by Dick Curless, Lenny Breau (as a teenage guitar virtuoso), Curtis Johnson, Hal Lone Pine and Betty Cody, Don Stover, and the Lilly Brothers. Many of these artists were on the verge of national stardom, and many ultimately chose to not follow the path to Nashville but instead remained up north, creating a distinct regional sound on a distinctly independent label.
