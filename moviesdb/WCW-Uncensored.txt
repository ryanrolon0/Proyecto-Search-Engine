WCW Uncensored

 Turner Sports President, Dr. Harvey Schillard recently removed Eric Bischoff as the President of WCW. A move that has swayed the balance of power back to WCW in the war with the nWo. In the midst of all of the chaos with Bischoff's ousting, a main event of epic proportions was named for the upcoming WCW Uncensored 1997 event. A three team battle royal elimination match. Three teams with three different agendas and goals. Team WCW consists of Lex Luger, The Giant, and The Steiner Brothers. If Team WCW wins, the nWo must return all of the WCW Championships they have and will be forced off of WCW Television for 18 months. Team Piper consists of "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and 4 Horsemen members McMichael, and Jeff Jarrett. If Team Piper wins, "Rowdy" Roddy Piper gets Hollywood Hogan in a cage match. Team nWo consists of Hollywood Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Randy "Macho Man" Savage. If Team nWo wins, the nWo gets the right to challenge for any WCW Championship anytime they choose. While Bischoff's removal from power was a negative for the New World Order, they aren't letting that stop them by announcing that NBA Bad Boy, Dennis Rodman would appear at WCW Uncensored as the newest member of the nWo. The stakes are high, only one team can survive! Which will it be and what will "Rod the Bod" do?
