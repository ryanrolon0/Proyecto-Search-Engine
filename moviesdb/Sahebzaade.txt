Sahebzaade

 Raja and Rahul are brothers living with their mother (Shardha) in a village located in the green hills of Himachal Pradesh. Incidently they love the same girl, Chinar. One of them sacrifices his love for his brother. First half of the movie revolves around that love story. In the second half, both brothers come to know that Bharu Pratap raped his mother and killed his father, Kishan. Then, both of them takes revenge from Bharu Pratap. In picturesque Himachal Pradesh live Raja, Rahul and their widowed mom, Sharda. Sharda has brought up her sons with a lot of love and affection and both have the same good nature, character and habits - so much so that they both fall in love with the same young woman, Chinar, who is the daughter of Sukhdev, and Laxmi. Raja loves Chinar and shows his love in his own style, but Chinar misunderstands this, for she has given her heart to Rahul. Chinar hopes that Raja, who is the elder of the two, gets married soon, so that her and Rahul's marriage takes place. Misunderstandings galore, as Sharda and Raja think the proposal is for Raja, while Rahul, Sukhdev, Laxmi, and Chinar know the truth. When the truth comes out in the open, it does cause considerable friction between the brothers. Taking advantage of this are Thakur Bhanu Pratap and Mama, who also would like to marry Chinar. Then Sharda tells her sons to unite and fight against the man who killed her husband. Will her sons give up their differences to avenge their father's death, or will they each go their own way and avenge it in their own style, knowing fully well that only one can marry Chinar.
