The It Girl

 The IT girl is who you want her to be, but not who you think she is. Loosely inspired by James A. Triptree's "The girl who was plugged in." The short premiered at the Clermont-film festival and market and is now available from Shortkutz as part of Volume 3. In the movie, the IT girl is "used" to promote a company and in real life, she promotes a digital movie company.
