Tre straniere a Roma

 Three girls from Milan dreaming of a holiday in Rome arrive in the city by train and decide to pretend to be rich Danish girls to attract three nice guys... Three guys looking for easy-going girls offer them a guided tour through the most beautiful places of the city. The girls accept and make the guys spend a fortune, but one evening they get drunk and one of them incidentally reveals she's just from Milan. The guys get upset and set up a sort of revenge, but in the end they make it up. One of the very first movies with Claudia Cardinale in a leading role.
