Santarchy

 Come and meet the 4 guys behind the annual 'Santarchy' celebration in Auckland, NZ, as they embark on a journey around their beautiful city dressed in Santa costumes. Accompanied by their very merry band of Santa cohorts, they soon spread their own special dose of anarchic Christmas cheer for everyone to enjoy...the result most definitely isn't your usual Santa parade. Merry Christmas!
