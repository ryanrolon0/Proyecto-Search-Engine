The Shape of the Voyage

 Why do we move the way that we do? Do our gestures have any real significance? What happens when we focus myopically on our movements? The footage in this piece was culled from 700 hours tracing the everyday lives of nine men as they grew their first beards. This was to be an examination of masculinity in American culture, as well as a nod to the everyday life studies of Georges Perec, Guy Debord, John Cage, and others. While editing the film into a narrative feature, the filmmakers began to notice the absurdity of repeated gesture among their subjects. The result is a twenty-minute short that questions repetition, modes of expression, and the strangeness of our individuality; perhaps even the way that we see ourselves.
