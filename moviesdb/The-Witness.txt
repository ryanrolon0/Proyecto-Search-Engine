The Witness

 When Eastern suburbs couple Matt and Lisa are invited for over dinner by some old friends, their hosts are expecting to catch up on old times and share some exciting news. Instead, dinner table conversation is hijacked by Matt, who shocks his hosts with his new-found fame as a star eye-witness. As the night unfolds, the audience is left to witness what comes next... Starring Australia's most notorious eye-witness, the 'Chk Chk Boom' girl Clare Werbeloff, this dark comedy explores society's obsession with fame at any cost.
