The Emperor's Treasure Chests

 In China, during the Qianlong reign (1736-1795) of the Qing dynasty,the emperor often ordered craftsmen to produce miniatures of his favorite art pieces so that they could be placed in small boxes to be at his side. These chests, commonly called 'curio boxes,' were meant to store small treasures. Not only marvelously designed spaces themselves, they also conceal profound and hidden puzzles of large within the small, a microcosm of the world according to the Qing court. This film introduces important curio boxes of National Palace Museum in Taiwan, allowing audiences to enjoy a rich feast of the senses.
