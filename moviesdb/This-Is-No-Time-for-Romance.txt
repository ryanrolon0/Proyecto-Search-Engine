This Is No Time for Romance

 Thirty-somethings Madeleine and Gervais are spending time at their summer cottage with their five children. Gervais is only there on the weekends, so Madeleine is alone with the children during the week. Although Madeleine and Gervais love each other, she believes that romantic love is not real love and is only a facade the young need in their lives. There are also stresses in their life, mostly regarding the children, who she nonetheless loves. Madeleine realizes that she is luckier than most, but that doesn't stop her from daydreaming about alternate lives for herself without Gervais and the children. Depending on how she is feeling at the time, these alternative lives include being a model, taking control of her life as a woman over all men, and being romanced by a younger man.
