The Night at Moon Lake Casino

 An original deconstruction of Tennessee William's Blanche Dubois, before A Streetcar Named Desire's actual story takes place. A newly married southern belle must ridicule her closeted husband after discovering him with his best friend in order to sustain her own sexual confidences as a woman.
