Prisoner Queen

 Follows a number of lonely and desperate characters living on the fringes of society, who are all linked through the bizarre odyssey of Alex, a dumb waiter who lives his life through his favourite cult TV show. Whilst nursing his eccentric mother through a bone-marrow transplant, Alex 'escapes' by stalking the streets at night, dressed as a sadistic prison officer. During these offbeat midnight strolls he becomes captivated by a mysterious and wise old drag-queen, Miss Chrissy.
