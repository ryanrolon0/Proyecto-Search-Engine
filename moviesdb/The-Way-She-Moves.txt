The Way She Moves

 Travis's mother, Angela, a housewife harlot, picked a real winner when she cast her beautiful eyes on Pepe Fuentes, a Latino charlatan, owner of Pet Psychics Dot Org. Ever since Travis can remember, he's had a way with animals. With few career options, he settles for the family business. But unbeknown to all, Travis really has a gift... and much more. Pepe though, is on the verge of blowing everything! His degenerate behavior has caused him to have mob boss, Ernesto Sanchez, on his ass for pissing away the financing for a pet-psychic reality show. Now Ernesto wants his money back or the pet-psychic business! Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, Travis's falls for the lovely Mrs. Sanchez, Ernesto's wife, dancing through a window. His obsession with her drives him to make daily visits, until his peep show antics turn horrifying when he witnesses her murder. Now a murder suspect, a pair of stoner cops, Riley and Wachowski, are on his tail, along with the flamboyantly deranged brother hit-man-duo, Bruce and Todd. On the run, Travis tries to prove his innocence while saving the family business
