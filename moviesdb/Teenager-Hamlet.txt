Teenager Hamlet

 A Toronto painter, Margaux Williamson, tries to see what story could be found at the center of her limited resources. Between herself, her friends, her neighborhood of empty hotels, and a boat load full of art-types, a collective game of make-believe is initiated in the hopes of finding something truthful at the center.
