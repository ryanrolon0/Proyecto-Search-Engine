Tak tak

 Set in Poland in the 1970s, the main character half-heartedly goes about his job as a censor at the state run television station, whilst conducting affairs with nurses, airline pilots, etc. Interesting scene where main character must illegally emigrate to his own country. The action is set in the seventies. This is a story of a man who tries to take advantage of an "ideology" of the sexual revolution in his own life. He even uses his very special abilities in this matter in his personal combat against the communist regime. But shortly can he realize that this frivolous activity has rather serious consequences. Torn between the woman he really loves and a beloved kid born out of an "adventure," he has to make a difficult choice.
