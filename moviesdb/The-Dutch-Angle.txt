The Dutch Angle

 A send up of student films, The Dutch Angle starts off like a typical action/thriller which features Brendan Hill, a cocky, young businessman on the run after attempting to blackmail his company. The flick quickly turns into an over-the-top comedy as we follow Brendan on his wild chase to safety. The comedy builds to an ending twist that reveals that everything is not what it seems.
