Redwood Forest Trail

 Arthur Cameron has spent many years establishing the mountain forest community of New Horizon for underprivileged boys. His chief assistant is Hattie Hickory who cooks and acts as a foster mother for the boy. The property is in danger of reverting to Julie Westcott, whose father Sam Westcott has recently being killed by riding his horse into a rope stretched across the trail, and she believes the New Horizon boys to be responsible. She is determined to end the Cameron project and to sell the property to lumber king Bart Bryant. Actually behind the trouble is her attorney, Craig Danvers, who is in debt to Bryant, who has agreed to take the New Horizon property in payment of the debt. Danvers, with the help of his henchmen Curley and Lush Mason, pulled off the killing through one of the New Horizon boys, Two-Bits, who just thought he was playing a trick on Westcott. Into this situation rides Rex Allen, a young official of the American Forestry League, and his sidekick "Alfalfa" Donahue.
