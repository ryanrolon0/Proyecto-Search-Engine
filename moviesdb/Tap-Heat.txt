Tap Heat

 Tap Heat is a 14-minute upbeat tap dance extravaganza that tells a story through dance as the only means of dialogue. A young man raised on urban funk has a hard time when trying to communicate with peers who utilize a different style of tap dancing and decides to stir things up. When his style is just not accepted, even considered illegal, the Tap Squad is called to straighten him out. A smart run-in with the agent played by legendary tap guru Arthur Duncan turns things around. Once the two begin to exchange ideas, the result is a full on production number done in the light of historic musicals with a high-tech edge.
