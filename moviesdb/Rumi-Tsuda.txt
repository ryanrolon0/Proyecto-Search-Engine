Rumi Tsuda

 A look into the eccentric world of a Japanese performance artist. Arriving in the United States in the 1980's to study fashion design she uses her fashion as a jumping off point. Her art continually explores the rich imagery in every medium that she taps into, while engaging her audience in a personal fantasy world of cross cultural feminine imagery.
