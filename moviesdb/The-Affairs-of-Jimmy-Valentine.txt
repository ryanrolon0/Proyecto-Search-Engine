The Affairs of Jimmy Valentine

 Mike Jason, idea man for the Bullard Advertising Agency, and Cleo Arden, director of the Jimmy Valentine radio program, based on the exploits of the old-time safe cracker, fear their jobs are in jeopardy when the sponsor decides to switch his show to another agency. Mike suggests that a $10,000 prize be offered to anyone who can locate the real Jimmy Valentine. Mike and Mousey, a little chiseler who has attached himself to Mike, follow a clue to a small town. Unknown to Mike, Mousey is out for revenge and kills two innocent men before they learn the identity of the real Jimmy Valentine. Mousey tries to kill Valentine but he himself is killed in the scuffle. Mike refuses to identify Valentine, claiming that one of the murdered men was the real Jimmy Valentine.
