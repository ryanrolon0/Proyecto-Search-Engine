The Woman in the Eye

 Combining playful archival material with street videography and intimate interviews, this experimental documentary short explores the advertising takeover of urban space in New York City. Three contemporary fl??neuses recount their movements through the image-ridden city, negotiating a place for the female self between desire and visceral alienation. Through the eyes of these women, the filmmaker reflects upon capitalist visuality and everyday gestures that challenge it.
