Seal and Walrus Hunting

 Amid all the natural beauties of snow and ice-bound regions of the northern territories, this hunt gives some excellent views. One specimen, as it makes its way through the glistening snow, leaves a huge snake-like track behind it for a tremendous distance, until it falls from the result of a well-directed shot of the hunter. The walrus is seen dragged from its home by muscular arms and laid at last helpless on the ice.
