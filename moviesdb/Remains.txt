Remains

 Hell is full, over populated with evil. The devil decides the time is right to attack earth so he sends hordes of evil zombies through space till they arrive on earth. The plan is to not only eat the humans but to start a new master race of half zombie/half human creatures. A renegade group of warriors in a small backwoods town learn of the devil's plot and go to battle with the zombies to save the world. Who will win? The living or the dead?
