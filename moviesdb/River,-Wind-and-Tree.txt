River, Wind and Tree

 A group of monks in red cloaks chants by the riverside. Nan, a sixteen-year-old boy, is among them. Several white-wrapped corpses are lying on the ground. Nan kneels down by one of them and removes the shroud gently, only to find the face that he loves the most. Two years earlier, his father returned from the monastery with startling news. Nan had been chosen and would be leaving right away. For the last two years, Nan has hated his father for abandoning him. He's been forced to do chores everyday and to participate in ceremonies, leaving little time for painting, the only thing he's ever loved. In his letters, written only to his mother, he has complained about his inability to comprehend his father's decision. Yet, everything started to change after meeting with a mysterious old lady who claimed to know his father. She gave him some mystifying advice, but only after falling into a river did he begin to grasp their meaning. After struggling, he finally looked up at the trees. As the tree wanted to remain still, the wind wouldn't stop. Nan let go. Now his mother is lying dead in front of him. With newfound understanding, Nan grabs his father's hand and together they begin pray for Nan's mother.
