The Actor

 A struggling actor who still dreams of making it big is oblivious to the fact everything in his life has fallen apart. Keeping his schedule open for auditions has prevented him from full time employment and led him into a sad routine life of only working mornings as an acting instructor. Literally starving and facing eviction, can his crush for the "one eyed" secretary turn his life around? Armed with cheesy movie lines, bad impersonations and the fact he has absolutely nothing to lose, he attempts to win the girl and prove love is not always blind (it sometimes has one eye).
