Secrets of the Code

 The film takes the viewer on a spiritual road trip from ancient Europe to modern Israel in a feature documentary that covers the terrain touched upon in Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. Interviews were done with many of the leading teachers, art historians and spiritual guides of our time.
