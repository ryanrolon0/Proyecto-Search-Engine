Tomcat Alley

 The player controls a United States Navy pilot who had to bring peace and stability to the world after the former Soviet Union had foolishly sold its military equipment to an unfriendly government. The game is in first-person perspective, and the player had to move quickly to launch missiles at enemy aircraft. Targeting enemies with the D-pad and a F-14 HUD screen brought this game outstanding reviews from critics.
