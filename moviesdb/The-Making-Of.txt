The Making of

 The Nutcracker Ballet at Hofstra University is a Christmas staple for thousands of Long Islanders. The proud father of a young ballerina takes his home video camera and goes behind the scenes to chronicle the joy and dedication of everyone involved, from tryouts for the littlest ballerina hopefuls, to the opening performance and technical grace of the principal dancers. The result is an enjoyable family documentary short that evokes inspiration and appreciation for the art of ballet.
