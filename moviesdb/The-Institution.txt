The Institution

 Three forensic college students, Bryan, Kate and Jonathan must investigate an unsolved case for their final graduating assignment. After their professor finally approves their case that is closely related to one student, they travel to a boondocks tourist town where they interview and investigate the officials on the mainland. From there, they hire a dark drifter to transport them to Felt Island, the location of the abandoned mental hospital. Once they set foot on the island, they are submerged into the world of forensics when they find a city official mutilated inside. They realize now that their once innocent school project has now turned into a struggle between the perfect grade and surviving the assignment.
