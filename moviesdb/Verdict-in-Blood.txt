Joanne's story turns to Judge Blackwell's murder, Joanne working alongside the chief police investigator, Detective Alex Emanuel. Joanne and Alex find that there are many potential suspects, including an ex-con who Judge Blackwell sentenced years earlier and with who she later had a very close association, a troubled youth who she let stay in her coach house, two grown daughters with who she had a dysfunctional relationship, a lawyer who she seemed to be "paying off", and the family of the victim of her last case who were unhappy with her light sentencing. Joanne and Alex also discover that Judge Blackwell was keeping some secrets which may be key to solving the murder. Judge Marcia Blackwell's change from hard line jail sentences to lenient community service arrangements is the subject of Joanne Kilbourn's documentary for Channel 7. When Judge Blackwell is murdered during an apparent robbery, after releasing a young man caught assaulting a woman, Kilbourn is convinced that the reason for her recent change of heart is the key to solving the mystery of her death.
