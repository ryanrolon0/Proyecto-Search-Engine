The Adventures of Triangle Woman

 This is the story of Evelyn T. Rangle (Triangle Woman) and her desire to become the Pecan Pie Baking Champion of North Garland - even though the contest is non-existent. The story takes us from beginning to end in her efforts to win the prize. Evelyn lives in her own little world - a world where caressing spatulas are the highlight of her day. During her attempt at the prize, people don't know quite what to make out of Evelyn, however, in doing so, everyone is "touched" by her "words of wisdom".
