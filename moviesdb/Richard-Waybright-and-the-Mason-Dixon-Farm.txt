Richard Waybright and the Mason Dixon Farm

 Richard Waybright was one of the first farms in the world to be taken off the grid and run on methane gas. His farm is also one of the first to use robots to obtain milk from dairy cows. He has been asked by U. S. Presidents, Russian, Chile, Cuba, China and other world leaders to come to their countries to improve their dairy farming. His farm innovations have helped feed the world.
