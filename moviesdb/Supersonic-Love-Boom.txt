Supersonic Love Boom

 Te'Devan extends his healing voice to the Deep Ellum Arts Festival in Dallas, TX, and finds mixed reactions. He demonstrates his healing sounds with and without invitation and reflects on why some people open up to him and why other don't. Through a series of encounters, we see Te'Devan go from being scoffed at to being heralded. His dance moves aren't too shabby, either. What drives this piece is sound design. The filmmakers wanted the audience to experience as much of the healing as possible. By this we hope to better equip the viewer to pass judgment upon these seemingly foreign methods. Te'Devan has pledged to appear at every festival this film gets accepted to, and will heal during the entire festival.
