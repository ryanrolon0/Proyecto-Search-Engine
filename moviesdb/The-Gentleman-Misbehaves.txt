The Gentleman Misbehaves

 An actor/producer has an argument with his fiancEe, and begins to court another girl whom he thinks is wealthy. She isn't, but she offers him $5,000 to marry her, in name only, as she is in danger of being deported from the United States. He does so. And then he begins to fall in love with her.
