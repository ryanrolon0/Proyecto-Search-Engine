Sleepless Night

 During a sleepless night, Sarah remembers her friendship /failed relationship with her friend Anna. Anna is very outgoing and fun and craves to be loved by everyone. This gets to a point where she manipulates Sarah into falling for her and having hope that her feelings could be reciprocated, only to completely flake out on her in the end and make it painfully clear that she only wants the attention. After Sarah relives this through flashbacks, she finally manages to fall asleep and dreams of Anna lying next to her in bed, tenderly embracing her.
