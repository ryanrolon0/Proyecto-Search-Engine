Razor Eaters

 RAZOR EATERS is your front-row ticket to an anarchistic rampage of violence, death and destruction. Based loosely on the exploits of the Hedge-Burners gang who plagued Melbourne and videotaped their crimes, the RAZOR EATERS gang swings its broad sword across suburbia, delivering explosive thrills and bloody eye-candy. Heralding the motto 'Organise, Traumatise, Immortalise', the five young members attract headlines by targeting all those we'd love to see get punished - filthy drug dealers, corrupt politicians, arrogant sports stars...and parking inspectors!
