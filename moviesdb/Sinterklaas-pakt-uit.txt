Sinterklaas pakt uit

 Sinterklaas has exchanged his red book for a laptop, but he cannot start the machine, so that means he doesn't know which present belongs to which child and he won't be able to join all the other artists, Pieten and families in the theater. While he is stuck at home, host Ron Boszhard tries everything he can to keep the show running, helped by the Eurokids, Dirk Scheele and his Liedjesband. After they have sung a few songs, Dirk is sent on a mission with Zwarte Piet to get Sinterklaas as soon as possible, but their car brakes down and runs out of gas. In the meanwhile, Ron gets an unexpected visit from six actors of the "Kameleon"-movies. Eventually, Dirk decides to dress himself as Sinterklaas to save the day. Ron falls for it, but the audience betrays him. Just when Ron wants to punish Dirk, the real Sinterklaas enters the building. He has recovered his red book, so everybody's is now relieved and at last, the show can go on as planned. After a magnificent performance, given by the girls of Treble as a surprise for Ron, there is only one thing left to do. Which Mystery Guest is inside that huge present on stage, wearing a sign that says "Do Not Touch"? Sinterklaas is absolutely astonished when Sita jumps out and gives her happy act to end a wonderful festival.
