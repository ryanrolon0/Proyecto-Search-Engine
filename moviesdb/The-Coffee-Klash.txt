The Coffee Klash

 Stephanie's mother, Gayle, is anything but laid-back. Though she loves her daughter, she often expresses it the only way she knows how micromanaging her life. Which is why this particular afternoon at the coffee shop might be tricky. After all, Stephanie has brought her mother here to not only tell her she's a lesbian, but to introduce Gayle to her new girlfriend, Mary Ann. Gayle's reaction to her daughter's news isn't exactly a surprise, nor is what her daughter expected. Enlisting the advice of the coffee shop staff, Gayle must come to terms with the afternoon's events, and try to set aside her judgments...sort of.
