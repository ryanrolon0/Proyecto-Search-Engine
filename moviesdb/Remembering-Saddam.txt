Remembering Saddam

 Remembering Saddam is the story of nine Iraqi merchants who are punished by Saddam Hussein by having their right hands amputated in Abou Gharaib prison. It chronicles life under Saddam, but concludes with hope the men will receive new bionic hands from volunteer Doctors in the United States.
