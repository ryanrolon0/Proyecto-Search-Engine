Viva Willie

 Willie and a friend are playing Cowboys and Indians when they happen across a statue of a pistol-wielding Poncho Villa. In an attempt to prove that he too is a tough guy, Willie spins a tall tale about his former life as a cowboy. Willie's girlfriend is harassed by another cowboy in a saloon where she dances. Willie engages in a gunfight to defend her honor. Meanwhile, Willie's horse is drinking beer from an unattended barrel. When the cowboy kidnaps Willie's girlfriend, he and his drunken horse must follow. A combination of creativity and haphazard luck allow Willie to save his girlfriend from the cowboy and his gang.
