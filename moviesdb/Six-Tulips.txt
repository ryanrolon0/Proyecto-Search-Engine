Six Tulips

 "Six Tulips" begins in Central Park with an almost comedic scenario of a charismatic young man and his apparently agitated girlfriend. Making a feeble attempt to salvage the relationship, he hands her a bunch of fresh tulips. In disgust, the girlfriend throws them down, leaving the young man to find comfort in the arms of a sexy female onlooker while the flowers are left deserted on the ground. The story takes a poignant turn as we see five different characters--one by one--enter the Park. Each tulip, in turn, finds its way to the characters, leaving an imprint on their souls.
