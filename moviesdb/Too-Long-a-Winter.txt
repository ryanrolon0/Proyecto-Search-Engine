Too Long a Winter

 Award-winning documentary that follows the solitary existence of Hannah Hauxwell, a farmer who lives all alone in a remote farmhouse without electricity or running water, in the isolated dale of Baldersdale in County Durham. The documentary also follows the return of Brian and Mary Bainbridge to an even more remote farm further up Teesdale after they left several years earlier because the winters had been too severe and they had lost most of their sheep.
