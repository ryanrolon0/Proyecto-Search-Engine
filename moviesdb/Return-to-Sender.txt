Return to Sender

 There in the jungles more than nine thousand miles away America lost what they cherished the most, its innocence. Upon returning home the American soldier was not about to lay down their very souls and surrender to a country void of loyalty and devotion. Honoring the ultimate sacrifice of 76 young men from South West Florida, Veterans organizations, community citizens and local contractors unite to build a Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Lee County. This film reveals commitment to brotherhood, the painful reality of motherhood and a deeper meaning to neighborhood. Witness the relentless task of building this special memorial.
