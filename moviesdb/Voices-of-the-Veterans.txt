Voices of the Veterans

 Beginning with the few surviving veterans of World War I and ending with the men and women of Desert Storm, Voices of the Veterans intercuts archival footage with modern interviews to create a recorded history of the participants of each of the major conflicts involving American troops during the 1900s. The unique perspective of the end of the century offers the opportunity to examine the causes, casualties and consequences of war through the eyes of the men and women who served.
