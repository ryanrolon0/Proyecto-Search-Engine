The Coo Coo Bird

 Woody reads in his newspaper that quail hunting season begins the next morning at 5 a.m. Not wanting to pass up quail hunting, he determines to get a good night's sleep but, of course, his attempts are ruined by all manner of distractions such as a flashing neon sign, an obnoxious cuckoo clock (the cuckoo itself is just as obnoxious), and the destruction of Woody's bed causing him to sleep on an "automatic table" which he has many a tussle with.
