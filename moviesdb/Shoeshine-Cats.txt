Shoeshine Cats

 When a notorious Jewish hood adopts a bookish 20-year old in chaotic 1963 New York, the cops, the tabloids and the Mafia all train their sights on the kid. Unable to prove he is not the mobster's heir, his only chance for survival is to demonstrate he is as tough, scheming and ruthless as the mobster himself.
