Tobo the Happy Clown

 TOBO THE HAPPY CLOWN is a kiddie-matinEe compilation feature with a circus theme. Producer Ed Finney (billed as "Eddie Finn") plays Tobo, and supplies the voice of the miniature puppet "Tobo, Jr." The film's various episodes involve Tobo playing fireman, inventing a time machine, and photographing wild animals. Finney also includes random silent footage of comedies and dramas with a circus background. Comedian El Brendel narrates an episode taken from WILD OYSTERS, a Charley Bowers stop-motion comedy of 1940. Gloria Jean and Nina Varela are seen in stock footage from Finney's 1959 production LAFFING TIME; neither actress appears in the new TOBO footage.
