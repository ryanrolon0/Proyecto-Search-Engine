Vakilisme - Et portræt af Babak Vakili

 See how a young political rapper in the ghetto of Copenhagen expresses his opinions and the message that in the end we are all humans. It's a documentary about following your dreams, going against the odds and believing that you have a voice and that voice can make a difference if you can make the people listen.
