The Westing Game

 A girl is angry about having to move to the city, but gets involved in a mystery when a rich neighbor is found dead. His will suggests that one of the people in her apartment house is his killer and doles out clues to find the culprit - as well as win $20 million. The weird neighbors include Berthe Erica Crow, Sydelle Pulaski, and Sandy McSouthers.
