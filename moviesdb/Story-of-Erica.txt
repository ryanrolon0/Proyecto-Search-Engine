Story of Erica

 When Erica, a 19 year-old college art student is working on a colorful art project she has no idea of the events that will transpire later that day. While she is working in a park a gust of wind blows her artwork away. She takes action and chases after it all across the city. She will find herself following it through a gritty downtown alleyway, across a busy freeway, and finally into a Rapid-Transit station where she will finally give up when it escapes in a departing Light Rail Train. Little does she know that even artwork can change into something different.
