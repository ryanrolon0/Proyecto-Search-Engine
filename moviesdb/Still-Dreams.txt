Still Dreams

 Liam, a photographer, struggles with his own sense of reality as he photographs people living in the squalor of the streets. Through his images we are transported into the world of two of Liam's subjects. John, a mentally ill man who has spent the last 15 years on the street and Lauren, a young woman making her way by any means necessary.
