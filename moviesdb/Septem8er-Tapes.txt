Septem8er Tapes

 Accompanied by an Interpreter, Wali Zarif, and a cameraman, Sunil, Don Larson, heads out to Afghanistan in order to locate Osama Bin Laden, the man George W. Bush believes was responsible for the terrorists attacks in the U.S.A. on September 11, 2001. Little does Don realize that soon he will face opposition from Wali himself and must face facts that the terrorists attacks were as a result of his country's 'foreign policy'; he will be arrested and held by the local Police; beaten by Al-Qaeda sympathizers who tell him that they and many others will not rest until Americans are forced to leave every Muslim country; and join hands with a bounty hunter, Babak Ali, to travel to the region bordering Pakistan, even after being fully aware that there is an open bounty on every westerner in the region.
