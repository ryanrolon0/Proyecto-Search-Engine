The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb

 When European Egyptologists Dubois, Giles and Bray discover the tomb of the Egyptian prince Ra, American entrepreneur and investor Alexander King insists on shipping the treasures and sarcophagus back to England for tour and display. Once there, someone with murderous intent has discovered the means of waking the centuries dead prince... When British archaeologists disturb the tomb of Ra, they have to deal with a curse that condemns anyone involved to death. The American showman who paid for the expedition, Alexander King, insists in taking the precious artifacts to London for an exhibition even though he could have left them for the local authorities who were prepared to pay a hefty price for them. As a result they not only have to face the curse but the wrath of Egyptians who have vowed have the precious find returned. When King finally has his first public showing, he finds that the sarcophagus is empty, the mummy having been taken or - more ominously - come to life to seek revenge.
