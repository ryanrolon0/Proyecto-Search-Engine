The Grateful Dead

 A man dies leaving a debt unpaid. Therefore, he is given an improper burial. A travelling stranger comes along, pays the man's debt, and gives him a proper burial. The travelling stranger goes about his way and immediately falls into a life threatening situation. He is aided by the Spirit of the man he gave the proper burial.
