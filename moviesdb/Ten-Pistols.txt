Ten Pistols

 In a world of high pressure sales, a young business man struggles to do what's right for his family and best for his career. On an important business trip, an invite to a private poker match sets into motion a series of choices that forces him to recognize what's most important. However, as his path becomes darker and more twisted, he finds himself less in control of his own fate and more at the mercy of the wicked.
