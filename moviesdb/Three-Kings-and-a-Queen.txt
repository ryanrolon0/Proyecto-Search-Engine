Three Kings and a Queen

 This Paramount Headliner short features the music of Vincent Lopez and his Orchestra; radio stars Barry Wood, Dick Todd and Del Cansion, and the frenetic Betty Hutton, with Kenneth Woods as the show's emcee. Barry Wood sings "You're Mine, You", Dick Todd does "The Penthouse Serenade" and Del Casino offers up "My Silent Love." Betty Hutton performs her jitterbug version of "Where Has My Little Dog Gone." and the Lopez orchestra swings in "The Pagan Love Song."
