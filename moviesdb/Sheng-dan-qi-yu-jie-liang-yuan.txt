Sheng dan qi yu jie liang yuan

 An illegal dealing of a soda-canned bomb between a crooked Hong Kong cop and two Japanese traffickers goes bad after an associate decides to go against their plans. Afterward, the incident brings together three witnesses mixed into the plot driver/police officer and an overzealous biker. They must team up to locate the missing bomb before it falls in the hands of the dealers.
