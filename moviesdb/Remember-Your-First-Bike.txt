Remember Your First Bike

 Remember Your First Bike chronicles Portland's Holiday Bike Drive, an annual event that gives away 500 bikes to underprivileged kids. The film follows volunteers and staff at the Community Cycling Center who work for a year to clean, refurbish then distribute the bikes in the community. Along with their new bikes, kids are also given safety education and a helmet so that they can ride safely. Topics explored include why bikes are important for kids, what this program brings to the community and why generous individuals give thousands of hours per year to make this event happen. Follow along as hundreds of deserving kids get to ride their first bike.
