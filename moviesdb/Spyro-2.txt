Spyro 2

 Spyro's back! This time around Spyro and Sparx want to take a vacation after their last adventure. And what would be a better place than the dragon theme park "Dragon Shores". But before they can get there they are unwillingly transport to another world in fear of a very power and short being called Ripto and his henchmen, Gulp and Crush. I guess a dragon's work is never done.
