Say That You Love Me

 MARK HERRAS & JENNYLYN MERCADO stars as Stephen & Kristine, two strangers whose romantic destinies are entwined with a message in a bottle thrown into the sea by a sad little girl 10 years ago. Stephen's the type of guy who, whenever he's near a girl he likes, stutter uncontrollably. Kristine, on the other hand, is a spunky girl-currently unemployed-who's never had a problem expressing herself and saying what's on her mind. What happens when Stephen & Kristine meet and clash is a funny but ultimately sigh-inducing adventure in youthful romance.
