Seventh Column

 Carelessness is sometimes referred to as the seventh column. Through the conduct of experiments, safety engineers work hard to prevent accidents and injuries associated with the seventh column. One such experiment is a simulation of highway driving. The test subject, Falstaff Pratt III, is provided a series of highway driving situations which may prove dangerous if not handled correctly. Most personal injuries occur in the home. Pratt may face the seventh column at home with smoking in bed, with a greased instead of waxed kitchen floor, with descending a poorly lit or poorly maintained steep staircase, or with an overcrowded shelf of materials. Seventh column workplace accidents can also happen to Pratt. The safety engineer's work may prevent many of Pratt's falls, which may benefit Pratt even if he is considered the Indestructible Man. During World War II, the seventh column is carelessness. We meet our Everyman, Falstaff Pratt the Third. Under the supervision of a safety engineer, Pratt participates in experiments while driving under the influence of alcohol. Then he illustrates how carelessness at home and then at work can lead to serious accidents. A slippery floor and stairs to the cellar are especially problematic at home. Noise, objects left on the floor, and poorly packed objects on mobile units can cause serious injury. The safety engineer, in his lab, is an important part of the war effort. We conclude with Pratt's father tilting back in his office chair.
