Street Hassle

 Enter the world of Martin (Colin Reid), a young street hustler. He sits down with an interviewer (Amity Carlson) to discuss his street life. And as the tape rolls, he journeys backwards into his brutal past. He begins to confront horrible and painful truths about his Father (John Trones), teacher (Bill Cooper) and his best friend, the punk rocker, Crista (Kariann Craig). Exploring seedy encounters with strange men, Martin relives old betrayals and painful memories, as he delves deep into his past. But will he come to terms with the man he's become? Or succumb to his personal demons? Are you ready for it?
