Robert's Float

 Join Yukoner Robert Bellon as he builds and sails a historic log raft down the Teslin and Yukon Rivers. A crew of 10 people from around the world assist Robert in his dream to make it all the way to Dawson City, land of the Klondike Gold Rush. With only paddles and pushpoles with which to steer the raft, the crew encounters many obstacles and natural wonders in the Yukon wilderness.
