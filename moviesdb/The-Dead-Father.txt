The Dead Father

 The patriarch of a troubled clan dies, but the resentment and yearning of the eldest son conspire to bring the errant father back for periodic visits in an only partially living state. These brief stop-overs are profoundly disturbing in thier incompletemess, and the boy finds himself driven inexorably to a final, frenzied act of self-loathing.
