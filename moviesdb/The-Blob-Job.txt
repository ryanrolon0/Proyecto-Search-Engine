The Blob Job

 The Blobjob is the first safety game designed to reach people about drugs, violence, sex, fire and traffic accidents while playing an adventure game. In The Blobjob five synthetic humans, Nanoblobs, are sent on a simple errand to deliver a super secret formula to the patents office. They all disappear. You are Ridley, a lowly security officer at NanoBlob Corporation. Finding the Nanoblobs is the only way to secure you from getting blobbed.
