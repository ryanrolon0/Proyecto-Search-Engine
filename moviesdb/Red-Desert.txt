Red Desert

 The Pecos Kid (Don Barry) is ambushed on the Red Desert and left to die by the man he was hunting. As he muses about his fate, he recalls President U.S.Grant (Joseph Crehan) and Colonel McMasters (Tom London) assigning him the task of capturing a notorious man of many disguises and aliases, Lefty Jordon, killer and robber of government gold bullion. Pecos leaves Washington, D.C and while coming West on a stagecoach he meets casino owner John Williams (Tom Neal), jeweler Sparky Jackson (Byron Foulger) and saloon entertainer Hazel Carter (Margia Dean.) Williams and his partner Deacon Smith (Jack Holt) hire Pecos as a card dealer. Pecos discovers that Williams is shipping bullion processed into jewelry and, when he starts after Williams, is forced to kill Smith. Williams escapes into the desert but is killed by Pecos after a long chase. He then realizes that Williams is not the wanted Lefty Jordan. Recovering from his wound, he heads to town to deal with Jordan as he now knows who Jordan really is.
