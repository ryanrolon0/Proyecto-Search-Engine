Tugboat Granny

 Tugboat captain Granny is happily piloting her boat around the harbor with her pet bird Tweety, when Sylvester the cat catches sight of them. Intent on making Tweety his next meal, he tries numerous times to get on board the boat. Each attempt, however, lands him in the water or worse. Even so, he keeps on trying.
