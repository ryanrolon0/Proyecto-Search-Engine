Rim of the Canyon

 Gene Autry's horse "Champion" ('Champion (II)' (qv)) is stolen by escaped convicts Jake Fargon ('Walter Sande' (qv)), Pete Reagon ('Jock Mahoney' (qv)) and Charlie Lewis ('Francis McDonald (I)' (qv)). Twenty years earlier Fargo and Lewis had been captured by City Marshal Steve Autry ('Gene Autry (I)' (qv))and sent to prison after the theft of $30,000 from "Big Tim" Hanlon ('Thurston Hall' (qv)), a bonanza king. Gene ('Gene Autry (I)' (qv))traces the convicts to the ghost town in which the loot had been hidden way, where he also finds Hanlon and school teacher Ruth Lambert ('Nan Leslie' (qv)). Loco John ('Clem Bevans' (qv))warns Gene the killers are around. The convicts pursue Gene and his friends through the spooky buildings. Gene takes up where his dad left off, going after the baddies who took $30,000, returning twenty years later to the ghost town where they left the loot. When his stagecoach is disabled in a race, Gene is left stranded and makes his way by foot to an old ghost town. There he finds a woman who says she comes here to talk to the ghost of a man that died twenty years ago. Three men also arrive, two of whom were sent to prison twenty years ago by Gene's father. They are looking for the money that was never recovered and Gene is in trouble when thay capture him. But then he gets unexpected help when the ghost turns out to be real.
