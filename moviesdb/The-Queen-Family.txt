The Queen Family

 The Appalachian mountains are home to a folk music tradition that traces its roots to England, Scotland, and Ireland. Picking up the African banjo and other influences in its evolution, this tradition gave rise to gospel, bluegrass and country music. The recipients of the North Carolina Folk Heritage Award, the Brown-Hudson Folklore Award, and others, the Queen family of Western North Carolina have become icons of Southern Appalachian culture.
