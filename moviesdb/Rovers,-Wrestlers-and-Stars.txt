Rovers, Wrestlers and Stars

 Using oral histories about an entertainment venue, this documentary provides a glimpse into the post-WW II cultural landscape of the upper South when R&B, country and gospel music was booming, racial boundaries were beginning to loosen, and professional wrestling was establishing itself as a mainstay of American entertainment. The documentary inspires discussion about the important role of local venues and tour routes in the careers of many recording stars who traveled nationally. It contributes to public memory about the Civil Rights Movement and entertainment icons such as Ray Charles, Memphis Slim, Ernest Tubb, Bill Monroe, Peg Leg Bates, Gorgeous George and Jackie Fargo. Following the demolition of the Quonset in 2003 the film provides a spring board for dialogue about the politics of historic preservation.
