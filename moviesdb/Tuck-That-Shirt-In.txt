Tuck That Shirt In

 I.S. 109 in Queens, New York, was considered an at-risk school until Principal Shango Blake began using a mixture of hip-hop and innovative teaching methods to turn the school into a model of success. His efforts reached their culmination with Tuck That Shirt In, a music video written, performed, and produced by the students, staff, and parents of I.S. 109. The video encapsulates the school's transformation and serves as a call to action for other schools and communities.
