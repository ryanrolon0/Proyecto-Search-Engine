The Monsters' Dinner

 A satiric reflection of our contemporary global society manifested in the near future, in which two seemingly ordinary couples sit down for a dinner party. Inspired from the British in-yer-face theater movement, the film cruelly and comically shows how our contemporary culture might transform into a world of extreme hedonism, violence and desensitization.
