The Guy Who Killed Paris Hilton

 Is art important or even relevant in the twenty first century? Filmed and recorded over two days in a working artist studio The Guy Who Killed Paris Hilton is both an art film and a film about art. It is an event and is neither documentary nor reality but a mixture of both. We invited a mixture of artists, musicians and performers to the studio to explore the definitions of art and its processes in an environment where artworks were being created. The result is a rich conversation that wrestles with defining art, narrowing the search but never quite reaching a single destination, providing answers that evoke more questions and leaving the viewer to create their own opinions and discussions.
