Tadipaar

 After getting into a violent confrontation, Shankar is arrested by the Police, tried in Court, sentenced to live outside the limits of the city, and must present himself at the nearest Police Station for the purpose of attendance. Shankar lives with a friend, Kadak, and one night comes across a woman in distress. He rescues her from some hoodlums, takes her home, and finds out that her name is Namkeen. Subsequently, he also finds out that she resembles a multi-millionaire Mohinidevi, who has gone missing. Shankar asks Namkeen to impersonate Mohinidevi, embezzle some of her wealth, so that the three can live a wealthy lifestyle. Namkeen agrees to do so, but the question remains where is Mohinidevi, and what will happen to Namkeen when she is found?
