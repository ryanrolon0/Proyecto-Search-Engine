To Lead a Jewish Life

 "How do children come to understand and love what it means to be Jewish? How do children connect with God? How do they find their identities as Jews?" With those questions as a starting point, "To Lead a Jewish Life Education for Living," explores the spiritual and social journey through which children learn to be Jewish. The program looks at the formal and informal institutions Judaism has used for generations to disseminate knowledge and forge a solid connection between children and their Jewish identity.
