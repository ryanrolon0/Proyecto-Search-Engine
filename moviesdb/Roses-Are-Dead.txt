Roses Are Dead

 It's Valentine's Day and the weather is scorching hot as three young beautiful women spend a relaxing evening by the pool with lavishing red roses. Their night of glee and celebration quickly turns to an abrupt end when a roses seller knocks on the door with intentions far from romance. It soon becomes clear that this is no laughing matter when the women realize that rejection toward the cryptic stranger can have such deadly consequences, all avoidable if only they had bought a black rose. Beyond this is a roller coaster ride in this one of a kind horror flick that reiterates the phrase - beauty is skin deep.
