Un-Natural State

 The people of Washington, DC live in the very seat of democracy, but they aren't allowed to sit in the chair! 'Un-Natural State' is a humorous and poignant documentary bringing light and lens to a loop hole in the Constitution of the United States -the 600,000 US citizens living in the US capital have no vote in the US Congress. Why isn't Washington, DC part of America's democracy?
