The Greatest Story Never Told

 Jeff Williams is a young man with a busy life. Work, school, church, sports. But when a missionary family stationed Africa comes home to the United States for a visit, Jeff learns that sharing his faith doesn't necessarily require leaving home. Jeff comes to realize that his ideas about what a mission field really is have kept him from being a witness to those around him, including his boss, his friends and even the kid next door.
