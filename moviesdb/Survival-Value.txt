Survival Value

 It is simple to go through life day to day, focused on your own survival. Most people assume their time is their own, spending it to further their own causes. Drew Weaver, a young wanna-be Hollywood agent, runs his whole life with the same success-driven, self-focused aggressiveness as his job. But his fast-paced routine is rocked when he discovers someone has broken into his apartment and is holding him at gunpoint Charles. In the mortal conversation that follows, the two brothers represent opposing philosophical ideals, forcing the audience to consider what they believe. In the end, an ultimate confrontation is inevitable, with both their lives at risk. We are left with the hanging question of the value of love, family, friendship - recalling the CS Lewis quote at the top of the film, "Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art... it has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival."
