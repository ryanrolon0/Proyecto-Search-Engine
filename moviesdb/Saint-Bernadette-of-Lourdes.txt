Saint Bernadette of Lourdes

 In the spring of 1858, a 'beautiful lady' appeared to a simple, 14 year old peasant girl in the south of France. No one else saw the woman, many did not believe the girl, some thought she was making it up, some even thought her insane. But news of her innocence, sincerity, and perseverance quickly spread throughout the land. Visitors arrived, miraculous cures began, and the town and its people were transformed. Today it is the most visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the girl is remembered as... St. Bernadette of Lourdes.
