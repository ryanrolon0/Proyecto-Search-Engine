Ways Home

 Ways Home is an interactive drama created to instruct the American public about options to avoid foreclosure. Viewers make decisions as three homeowners-in real-life, everyday situations-who are struggling to make their payments and avoid foreclosure. Make decisions as either Richard, Miguel, or Jackie regarding what they should do in their unique financial situation, and experience the positive outcomes or negative consequences of the choices you make. Helpful tips and advice are also included along the way.
