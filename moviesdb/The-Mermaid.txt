The Mermaid

 Cowan, an isolated fisherman with a tragic past discovers a hideous and barely alive mermaid in his nets one morning. He takes it upon himself to nurse it back to good health. In doing so he unwittingly gives the mermaid the strength to bring back memories he wished were buried, driving him to return her to the sea.
