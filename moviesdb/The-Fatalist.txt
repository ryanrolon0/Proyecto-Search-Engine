The Fatalist

 Alex, a young businessman fighting with his girlfriend, goes to his boss' house after work to play poker. While there he meets an unusual gathering of gamblers. His boss, Darren, is a charismatic friend who always has a sarcastic come back. George, Darren's friend, is an independent person who is dominated by his wife. Then there is Alex's co-worker, Victoria, who has a bitter grudge against Alex and makes it known. The four play poker, all the while, Alex questions God and fate while discussing his girlfriend and his lucky streak. Victoria, an ardent Christian, has had enough and puts an end to Alex's blasphemy. She challenges Alex to a game of Russian Roulette to prove that fate exists and Alex is wrong. Of course, Darren and George think they are both crazy and put up a fight to the game, but at this point, it is out of their control and solely in the hands of the passionate Victoria.
