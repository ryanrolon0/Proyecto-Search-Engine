Silo Killer

 College kids prepared for everything for their weekend camping trip in the Arizona desert... Except for a mad dog killer who plans on killing them one by one and stacking their dead bodies into an anbandoned grain silo. A group of college kids go camping out in the Arizona desert, unfortunately an ax-wielding maniac joins the fun. Fortunately the college kids came with arsenal of pistols and rifles. And fortunately for the mainiac, he's got a nice abandoned grain silo for disposing of the bodies. Beer drinkin' college dudes, babes in bikinis, mob thugs- looks like the maniac has some work to do.
