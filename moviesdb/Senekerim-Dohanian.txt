Senekerim Dohanian

 A survivor of the 1895 massacres in Malatya, Turkey, Senekerim Dohanian came to the US in 1903, not speaking any English. Twelve years later, he had earned a bachelor's degree from Tufts University and a master's degree from Harvard. Dohanian became a noted entomologist with the USDA and was a pioneer in the field of biological control of insect pests. His work has had a lasting impact on both science and society. It's an inspiring story of a remarkable man, but one that, until now, was unknown, as he never married or talked about his work in any detail. Dohanian's great-great nephew Robert Coulter, age 12, researched, wrote, and produced this 10-minute documentary, which won the 2009 National History Day award for junior individual documentary.
