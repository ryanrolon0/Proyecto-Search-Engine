The Fighting Legion

 After being shot, a dying Marshal Dawson gives Dave Hayes his badge and asks him to finish his job. Dave becomes Marshal but when Bowie, the man that shot Dawson appears, he exposes Dave as an imposter. Dave is then in trouble when Edwards incites the mob to lynch him. A Texas Ranger, Tom Dawson, chasing Dave Hayes and "Cloudy" Williams, is injured when his horse falls; the two men ride back and aid him and, in gratitude, he lets them escape. As he rides away, he is shot from ambush by an unknown assailant, who gets away. Dave and "Cloudy" ride to Bowden to turn in the Ranger's badge, and Dave is mistaken for a Ranger. Dave becomes interested in Molly Williams but Blake, a banker, and Bowle, a cattle-buyer, determine to do away with Dave by framing him for the death of the Ranger. Dave escapes and appears in the saloon at midnight and just as the guilty man is about to confess (and implicate Blake)he is killed by Blake. The latter imprisons Molly in a nearby building, and Dave goes to her rescue.
