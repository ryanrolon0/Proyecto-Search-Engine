Tulip Time

 Virtually everyone in Italy knows songs like 'Tulli-Tulli-Tullipan' and 'Ciribiribin'. Hardly anyone remembers the original interpreters Lescano, three Dutch sisters with Jewish roots. Alexandra, Judith and Ketty Leschan were the daughters of Alexander Leschan,at the time a famous circus artist, and the operetta singer Eva de Leeuwe. After roaming Europe, they arrived in the 1930s in Turin, which was the heart of the Italian radio world, where they were discovered by a local talent scout. In no time, they sold 100,000 records and even Mussolini - Il Duce - was among their fans. The success story ended in 1942, when the radio bosses sent the three sisters away because their mother was Jewish. A year later they were even arrested on suspicion of espionage. Immediately after the war, their comeback was not very successful so they decided to try their luck elsewhere. In 1947, they left for Argentina, where they toured for several years. By then, Ketty had already left the trio to be replaced by Maria Bria. Several years later, the trio stopped playing altogether and Sandra returned to Italy and never saw her sisters again. In 1987, she died, lonely and almost forgot. Marco de Stefanis and Tonino Boniotti happened upon this fascinating story by chance and decided to investigate how it came about that the three Dutch girls were so popular in Italy in the 1930s and 1940s. This investigation resulted in the documentary Tulip Time, the story of their rise, incredible success and inevitable fall.
