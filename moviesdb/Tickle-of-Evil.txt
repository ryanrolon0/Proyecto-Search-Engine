Tickle of Evil

 Laughing is usually the best medicine, that is, unless the villainous Evil Tickle is involved. Using his giggle ball, he captures his victim's laughter and gains total control of them and their happiness. However, when his archrival, Madame Shockra, nabs the giggle ball for her own wicked deeds, Evil Tickle doesn't find it very funny.
