The Hand Is Pinker Than the Eye

 Seeking winter shelter, the Pink Panther enters Zammo the Great's house while the magician is away, and the panther discovers a mischievous rabbit that leads him through a series of phantasmagorical phenomena, including a mobile door with stairs that change from ascending to descending, depending on what position the door is at in relation to the floor, a tilted will picture that, when straightened, causes the whole house to tilt, a deceptive, two-way mirror, and a subjective, psychedelic hole in the floor.
