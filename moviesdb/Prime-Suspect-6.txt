Prime Suspect 6

 Helen Mirren (Calendar Girls, Gosford Park) is back as Inspector Jane Tennison in an eagerly awaited new episode of the Emmy award-winning series Prime Suspect on ExxonMobil Masterpiece Theatre. It's been seven years since Tennison put the handcuffs on a psychotic killer in the last episode. Now, amid pressure to retire, she faces a death squad that has unleashed the horrors of the Balkan civil war on London.
