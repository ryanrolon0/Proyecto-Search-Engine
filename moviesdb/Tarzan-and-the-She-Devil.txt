Tarzan and the She-Devil

 Ivory poachers, headed by Lyra the She-Devil, Vargo and Fidel, capture a native tribe to carry their loot. Tarzan intervenes and is captured. Jane is also captured and believed killed, so the despairing Tarzan endures endless torture until he learns she is alive. He rises to the occasion and leads his elephants in the usual victory stampede.
