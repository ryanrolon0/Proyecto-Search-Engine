See the Man Run

 When some guys kidnap a man's daughter, they call to make their ransom demand but the number they got was an old one and that's been reassigned to another man. When he tries to call the girl's father, they freak out before he could explain. That's when he decides to pretend to be the kidnapper and get the ransom money from the father and keep part of it for himself.
