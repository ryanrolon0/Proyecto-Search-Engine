Red Room

 In Nazi-occupied Paris, a beautiful prostitute named Lola ekes out an existence, gallantly servicing a distinctly Nazi-only clientele. Her only friend in this chaotic world is a fellow whore named Kitty, who is actually an undercover French Resistance spy! Kitty's latest plot involves overthrowing the establishment and kidnapping its evil proprietor, Herr Schmidt, a ghastly-looking man with high-ranking Third Reich contacts. Little does Kitty know that Schmidt is wise to her big plans and has every intention of sabotaging them! Intrigue, treachery, sex, singing and dancing follow as the pulpy story comes to a head in the titular location... the brothel's most luxurious space, the Red Room.
