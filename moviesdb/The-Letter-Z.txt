The Letter Z

 Three students are trapped in an abandoned building, chased by terrible, bloodthirsty creatures. They could try to hold them off until the safety of morning comes, but one of them has been wounded, and requires medical aid. When they decide to make a run for it, they come face-to-face with the creatures. It is then that they discover that the evil they are facing is not even remotely like what they were expecting.
