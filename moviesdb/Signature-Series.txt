Signature Series

 We'll travel from his days as a scrawny kid hitting balls against a wall to his record 14 Grand Slam titles, and everything in between. We'll cover his greatest triumphs and most heartbreaking losses. The pain of losing a coach and friend, and the joy of starting a family. Featuring interviews with Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Patrick McEnroe, among others, Signature Series looks deep into the career of the man that many call the greatest tennis player who ever lived.
