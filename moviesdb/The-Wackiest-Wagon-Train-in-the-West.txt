The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West

 Four episodes of "Dusty's Trail" (1973) coupled together into a feature film. In a similar situation to "Gilligan's Island" (1964) and even starring Bob Denver again, Dusty is a bumbling assistant to Wagonmaster Callahan. Thanks to Dusty's bungling, they are soon separated from the wagon train and lost in the wilderness. The characters parallel those of Gilligan's show.
