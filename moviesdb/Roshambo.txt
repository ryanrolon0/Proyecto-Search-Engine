Roshambo

 In Van Nuys, California, worlds collide at Elks Lodge #2790 when promoters Carol and Timothy Burgess bring the colorfully ridiculous "sport" of Roshambo (Rock, Paper, Scissors) to town. With over $750 bucks in prize money and the semi-regional championship on the line...an amateur comedian, a quiet Catholic school librarian and an aggressive Hummer salesman, dare to enter the daunting ring of fire that is "professional" Roshambo. Who will overcome children, frat boys, the pancake, and brittle bones to reign as Semi-Regional Champion? Ready, Set, Throw.
