The Great Escape

 Ordinary people are put in cinema-inspired settings, challenging them to find a way out using everyday ingenuity. Each week, teams are dropped off blindfolded in a different extreme environment, lost in the desert, trapped in the mountains, locked in a prison, marooned on an island. The team must figure their way out through multiple stages and escape to win a cash prize.
