The Last Round-up

 Gene Autry attempts to arrange that both the Indians and ranchers, scheduled to be driven from their land by Mesa City's mew aqueduct, benefit from the deal, which is opposed by town banker Mason. Mason stirs up the Indians against Gene but, with help from school teacher Carol, Gene is able to expose Mason's schemes.
