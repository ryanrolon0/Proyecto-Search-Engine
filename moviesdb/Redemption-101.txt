Redemption 101

 Redemption 101 is a feature film that revolves around the quirky crew of the starship Redemption as they transport an ambitious bishop and his entourage to the remote Orion star system. It seems like just another mission for the battle-weary crew until they answer a distress signal from a seemingly deserted planet and end up with some alien passengers who are not quite what they seem. Before long they find themselves drawn into a world of mystical relics, ancient feuds, and apocalyptic events!
