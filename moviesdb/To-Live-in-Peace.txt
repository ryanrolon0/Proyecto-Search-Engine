To Live in Peace

 Set in an idyllic mountain village near Siena in Italy in 1804. The priest Don Geronimo and his flock go about their lives contentedly and peacefully, with illness and ill-will a rarity in the village. One day however, the French army arrives with a General on a mission to Don Geronimo which attracts nobles and lawyers and begins to cause greed and ambition amongst people in the village.
