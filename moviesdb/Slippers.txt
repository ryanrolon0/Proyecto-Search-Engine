Slippers

 In Kibbutz Ayelet Hashahar sits my Dad, Shaul the Shoemaker. As time goes by, both my father and his occupation are being pushed aside. Moshiko, my step brother, is an entrepreneur, who tried, together with the 'Society for preservation of Israel heritage sites', to preserve the site as a viable and living site. He is trying to enlist my father to the project, while straggling against the generation gap and the Kibbutz authorities.
