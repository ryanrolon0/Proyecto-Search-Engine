Taivalu

 Tuvalu is an ally of Taiwan located in the southern Pacific Ocean. Its territory consists of only 26 square kilometers, and will be the first island nation to be submerged by the oceans once the sea level rises due to global warming. The director Huang Hsinyao left his hometown after the 88 flooding disaster in Taiwan in search of this disappearing island called Tuvalu. The filming process is marked by a succession of unexpected events.
