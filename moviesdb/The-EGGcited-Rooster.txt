The EGGcited Rooster

 Foghorn has egg-sitting duty while his wife plays cards. Henery Hawk, dressed as an Indian ("Me last of mo-hawk-ens!") comes by as Foggy is looking for someone to relieve him. Foggy gets Henery to egg-sit for a little while, but the little hawk gets impatient. Foghorn sends him off with a "hen grenade" which explodes under the dog (leaving him covered with a fried egg). The dog helps the hawk steal the egg, and calls Foghorn's wife. The egg then changes hands several times; Foghorn's wife comes along and beans him with her rolling pin. As the final insult, Henery scalps Foghorn with his tiny tomahawk. Foghorn Leghorn's sharp-tongued, domineering wife orders him to sit on their egg while she goes out to play bridge, but Foghorn becomes careless, allowing little Henery the Chicken Hawk to take the egg away. Foghorn must retrieve it, or else!
