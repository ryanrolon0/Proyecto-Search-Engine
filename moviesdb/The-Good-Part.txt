The Good Part

 Thirty-ish Chauncey has no wife, no life and he's about to get the boot out of his parent's lush Van Nuys pad. When Chauncey's cousin(a P.A. at Ramrod Studios) comes up with an idea for a "get rich quick" live porn web-cast, Chauncey resists. Until he finds out his cousin has dug up his super-crush of the past ten years; infamous adult film legend, Corey Wilder. Who'd have guessed the shoot would turn into a nightmare starring his overly-sexed high school alumni, know-it-all porn gurus, a gay porn director, nosy neighbors and the Van Nuys Mafia?
