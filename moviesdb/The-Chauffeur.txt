The Chauffeur

 As Children, Robert and his sister Nicole lost their parents in a fatal car accident. With nowhere to turn, the children were trusted to the care of a local orphanage. In time, the sweet, young Nicole was adopted and taken away from her brother Robert. Robert was left to be alone in an abusive lonely orphanage. He would never accept losing his sister. Few people have heard from Robert in the years since he left the orphanage. Years later, Nicole and her husband Kevin prepare for a vacation to Las Vegas with their friends Michelle and Mike. They wait together anxious to reach their destination. Nearby is a detective who is being dispatched to investigate a number of deaths in the area. He has few new leads, but picks up a tip about a group of four friends that have gone missing since they were supposed to be picked up by the chauffeur.
