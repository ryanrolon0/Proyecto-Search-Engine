Reterritorialización

 A couple inhabits the remains of a failed society, bound for despair. She ploughs a path which leads nowhere, while he digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole in the ground. Exhausted, she talks into the hole, trying to convince him to leave, but he rejects her. Just then, they are interrupted by the irruption of an entrepreneur and his mercenaries on a televised colonization tour.
