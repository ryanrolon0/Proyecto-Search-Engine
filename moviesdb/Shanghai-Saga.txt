Shanghai Saga

 Shanghai Saga is a video essay-poem on Shanghai by two Hong Kong women, Linda and Gina, who relate to Shanghai on very different horizons. Linda knows Shanghai as a film historian, cultural theorist, a curious reader of literature, and an interested traveler who walks the city, whereas Gina, an economist and free-lance art incubator, splits her residence between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Linda engages in the literary and visual imaginary of Shanghai, observes the everyday texture of the city and the effects of urban renewal; Gina studies the unnoticed scenario of excessive real estate development as an accidental refuge for unknown artists. Gina brings to her camera the faces and voices of individuals in Shanghai who seek to make sense of their artistic career, while Linda discovers individuals in Hong Kong who have unique personal connections to Shanghai.
