Rebel Without a Cause

 Jim Stark is the new kid in town. He has been in trouble elsewhere; that's why his family has had to move before. Here he hopes to find the love he doesn't get from his middle-class family. Though he finds some of this in his relation with Judy, and a form of it in both Plato's adulation and Ray's real concern for him, Jim must still prove himself to his peers in switchblade knife fights and "chickie" games in which cars race toward a seaside cliff. Jim Stark's family has just moved to the suburbs of Los Angeles. He meets Plato, and Judy, whom he likes. He somehow gets mixed up with some tough guys who talk him into participating in their "Chickie run", which involves driving cars towards the edge of a cliff. One of the other boys accidentally dies, and he was Judy's boyfriend. So, Jim, Judy and Plato are forced to hide in an old abandoned mansion to hid from the police and the friends of Judy's boyfriend, who believe that Jim ratted on them to the cops.
