The Two Deaths of Los Angeles Chinatown

 Los Angeles Chinatown has a colorful history, a controversial present, and an uncertain future. Seventy-five years ago, thousands of Chinese Angelenos were forced to relocate en masse from the city's vibrant original Chinatown to make way for the construction of the landmark Union Station. Today, a different kind of displacement is taking place. The ongoing transformation of today's Chinatown into an upscale residential and arts district is changing the soul of the neighborhood and pushing away working-class immigrant families. Diving past dragons, pagodas, and fortune cookies, "The Two Deaths of Los Angeles Chinatown" shows you the neighborhood as you've never seen it before.
