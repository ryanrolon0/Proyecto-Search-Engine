Vegas Date

 What happens when a black gangsta' rapper and a white blonde popstar diva are made to go out together on the Vegas strip for reality TV? Nothing short of raw and uncensored. America's under-belly is laid out in the open as two diametrically opposing views were chronicled over a four day period in Las Vegas 2006 creating a reality TV show too hot for any network to air. This true account is not only too hot for TV, but even film festivals have said its too controversial to show. Reality TV's limits are destroyed. Nothing like this has ever been aired.
