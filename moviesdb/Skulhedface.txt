Skulhedface

 GWAR, the bloodthirsty alien antiheroes, conduct a worldwide telethon to feed souls to the World Maggot, which will transport the members of GWAR off our miserable planet once it grows. GWAR's tele-casts attract the attention of GlomCo, the world's monopolistic entertainment giant. GlomCo attempts to bribe GWAR's manager, Sleazy P. Martini, into selling GWAR out to the mainstream of Sunday morning cartoons. GWAR's revenge on the sniveling executives at GlomCo uncovers a dastardly plot to homogenize all humanity by the evil doctor Skulhedface!
