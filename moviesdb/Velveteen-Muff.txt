Velveteen Muff

 Local "Public Access Media" host, Nick Avery announces the winners of the First Annual Unknown-American All Girl Punk Band Contest Drawing (also known as the UAAGPBCD). The winning band, Velveteen Muff has won a free recording session with a small music studio and a chance to send their demo tape to Brian Bros Records. There's only one problem. Velveteen Muff doesn't have any material. As the dysfunctional band scrambles to write a song before their scheduled recording session, Nick Avery's "Music Access" camera crew have moved into the band's house to document their progress. Nick conducts Reality TV style interviews with the band and it quickly becomes apparent that Velveteen Muff's lead singer and bassist, Damn Mandy is an alcoholic living in fear of a lead guitarist stealing her thunder. Fellow band members, Cizzle (drums), Lizzy (maracas), and E (electric triangle), share their opinion about the band's progress, while Damn Mandy attempts to learn a new power chord in time for their recording session. Unfortunately, Mr. K (owner of Brian Bros Records) has heard about Velveteen Muff's shortage of songs and threatens to steal their name and give it to "The Talent"...
