The Bridge at Remagen

 In the last days of World War II, the Allied Army desperatly searched for a bridgehead across the impenetrable Rhein River, in order to launch a major assault into the center of Germany. "Bridge at Remagen" tells the true story of the battle for this last bridgehead, from both the German and American perspective. A war weary American unit is ordered to capture whole the last bridge left standing across the Rhine before a determined corp of German defenders can blow it up in this WWII movie about futility and bravery.
