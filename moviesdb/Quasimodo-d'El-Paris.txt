Quasimodo d'El Paris

 El Paris, a town located somewhere uncertain, but in our time. Quasimodo is hunchbacked, bald, deaf. He takes size 47 in shoes and is contented.

Now terror reigns in El Paris killed. The head of police, Phoebus, erotomaniac and incompetent, leads the investigation in his beautiful, shiny 4-wheel drive. Quasimodo is the prime suspect, although he is innocent. Frollo has only one aim truth (or is he?). EsmEralda has only one aim Quasimodo has only one aim aim
