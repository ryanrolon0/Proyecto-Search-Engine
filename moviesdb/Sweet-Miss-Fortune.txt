Sweet Miss Fortune

 Rich, spoiled, bored Andrea Fortune gets a wish come true - even though she didn't wish it. Her fairy god-fellow, Bruce, transports Andrea from her mansion to someone else's, where she must work as a maid and learn humility, and where he gambles that she may discover what it is to be a happy and pleasing woman.
