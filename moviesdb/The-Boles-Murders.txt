The Boles Murders

 On Friday, August 13, 1965, a typical American family left Orange County, California, on a visit to their new mountain cabin in Crestline. They would never return. Their bullet-riddled bodies were discovered two days later when they failed to return home. Lost that weekend were aerospace engineer Jim Boles, his wfe, Darlene, and the couple's two young sons, 13-year-old Bobby, and Tommy, age 12. The case remains officially open and unsolved nearly 40 years later.
