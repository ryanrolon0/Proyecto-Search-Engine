Rwanda

 In the winter of 2007, an aspiring Rwandan filmmaker is forced to go to the traditional court called 'gacaca' to confront face to face Emmanuel, his parents murderer. To come to terms with his worst fear, he frames on video 5ft of distance the two perpetrators and documents this unique experience. A Rwandan aspiring filmmaker emotionally resurfaces to confront his parents' murderers. He frames the perpetrators within 5 ft of distance. Then, he visits the grave of an Italian nun next to his grandfather's in a church's crypt of 10,000 bodies to discover 52 dead bodies of members of his family missing. Is it possible for someone who has lost his family through genocide to ever forget his trauma? Probably not. Can he at least forgive the perpetrators, then? The Rwandan filmmaker Gilbert Ndahayo does his best. He lost his parents in 1994, when the Hutus slaughtered them and around 200 fellow villagers. Ndahayo survived the massacre. Partially in cinema vEritE style, he films the location of the mass grave in the village, which is to be exhumed in order to allow the survivors to at last perform a dignified funeral. The agony of the past rises up once more, but this is also the moment to start getting over the collective trauma. Surviving relatives question the perpetrators at public hearings. An emotional Ndahayo, himself being filmed on this occasion, asks his father's murderer, once a good acquaintance of the family, how he went about it and how his father died. Each segment of the film presents another facet of this traumatic history and the attempts to deal with its legacy. Ndahayo does this by picking up the camera, while others demonstrate furiously, doubt the existence of a God, or debate the meaning of forgiveness. Gilbert Ndahayo is the first Rwandan genocide survivor to make a personal film on the subject.
