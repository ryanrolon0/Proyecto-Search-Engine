Varg Veum - Din til døden

 There has been no shortage of women in private investigator Varg Veum's life, but not for the long haul. When the search for her estranged husband Jonas's car brings Varg together with Wenche Andresen, he believes he may have found the one. But there's a problem; Jonas ends up dead, and Wenche is the cops' prime suspect. Varg can't believe this beautiful woman with her old fashioned ideas on love and fidelity can possibly be guilty, and he sets out to crack the case and prove her innocence.
