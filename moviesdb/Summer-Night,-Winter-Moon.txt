Summer Night, Winter Moon

 Art dealer Trevor and his best friend Dante, an Italian/American fashion photographer, holiday in Capri where they both fall for Antonia, a local beauty. One of them marries her. Back in London Antonia is last seen in Regent's Park walking her Jack Russell terrier. The remains of a female body are recovered from Regent's Canal, and both her husband and his best friend are suspects in what increasingly appears to be a murder. This fast-moving story travels backwards in time. Exploration of the mystery of Antonia's fate follows twists and turns as hair-raising as the roads on the mountainous isle of Capri. The audience is ushered to the astonishing ending, proving along the way that the deepest mystery of all is that of the soul torn between desire and loyalty.
