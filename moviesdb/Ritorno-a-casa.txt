Ritorno a casa

 A man traveling in a car arrives to an old abandoned country church. His arrival is really a return, almost a voyage through time back to the places where he has spent his childhood. Places he has left to follow a different route through life, but which remain indelibly stamped within his heart. Memories bounce back against the walls of a tower in ruins and are swept by the waves on the shore, silent witnesses to unexpected decisions.
