The Spaghetti Story

 A brief Swiss travelogue. Excellent spring weather and a mild winter this year in Switzerland have ensured a bountiful spaghetti crop. While the Italian spaghetti harvest is very well known, the Swiss also grow spaghetti. By the shores of Lake Lugano, local townspeople pick the wet strands of spaghetti from the branches of the spaghetti trees. Years of successful breeding have produced a crop of a uniform length. Tourists enjoy a satisfying meal of fresh, sun-dried spaghetti.
