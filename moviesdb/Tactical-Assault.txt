Tactical Assault

 A deranged Air Force pilot seeks to destroy the life of his former commander, who shot him down during the Gulf War to stop him from shooting on unauthorized and civilian targets. USAF captain John 'Doc' Holiday was decommissioned after a fatal incident with a civil airliner over an Iraqi 'no fly zone'. His squad leader there, Colonel Lee Banning, gets him reactivated for the Bosnian front, depending on further therapy. Doc however feels Lee wrecked his career, and will stop at noting for revenge, neither sabotage nor target Lee's pregnant wife.
