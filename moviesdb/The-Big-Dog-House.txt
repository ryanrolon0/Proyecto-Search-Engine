The Big Dog House

 This MGM short, which stars an all-dog cast, is about Trixie and Fido and their evil boss. They all work at the Dogville Department Store but the boss has his eye on Trixie and so frames Fido for murder. Trixie is convinced that her man (er, dog rather) is innocent and works feverishly to save him from the electric chair. In this dogville spoof, a department store employee is framed for murder by his boss, because he wants the employee's girlfriend for himself. The girlfriend does everything she can to see that the boss gets what he deserves.
