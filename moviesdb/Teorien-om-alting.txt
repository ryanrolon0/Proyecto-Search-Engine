Teorien om alting

 Exploring the world of physics and the beginning of the Universe through the eyes of the Standard Model. This takes us to phenomenoms like wormholes and baby universes and way back to the first second of Big Bang. The key focus is on the High Energy Physician Holger Bech Nielsen, known for his theories on the Super Strings. He tells about his dream, his hunt for the united theory which binds together all known great physical laws, the so-called Theory of Everything.
