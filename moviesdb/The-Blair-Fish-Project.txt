The Blair Fish Project

 A voice-over intones, 'In July, 1998, three models went fishing at Fish Lake. They took three bottles of tequila, margarita mix, some ice, their fishing gear, and a video camera. They were never seen again. [pause] One year later their videotape, along with their fashionable swimwear, was found.' A spoof on 'Blair Witch Project' has a nervous model behind the camera, adding her fears and apologies from time to time, and two other models who bicker continuously. Things go from bad to worse mascara, life-sized inflatable dolls hanging from trees by their campsite. Is murder afoot?
