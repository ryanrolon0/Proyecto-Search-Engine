Stayed Out Overnight

 On the night of June 30, 2007, cashiers and salespeople of Homever, a superstore, started to fight for their rights and to disclose issues regarding contract-worker protection laws. This was not only the first in-house picketing action by young women workers in history, but it also gave them an opportunity to seek a new ego as women. Their one night picketing in the store turned into a 510 day strike. This long struggle revealed problems and limitations of the labor movement in Korea.
