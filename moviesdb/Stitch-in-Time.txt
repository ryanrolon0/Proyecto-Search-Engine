Stitch in Time

 Family is business and business is money. Roy Stitch was the best collector his Uncle Norman had ever seen, but when an unforgivable act is committed, Roy is pushed into the depths of depression, unable to perform on the job. Trapped in a world of brutality and deception, tormented by memories of the past, Roy must now choose between loyalty to his family or control of his own destiny.
