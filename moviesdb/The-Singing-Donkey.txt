The Singing Donkey

 Here is a novelty. A clown presents himself accompanied by a trim little donkey, who performs a number of tricks at his master's command. Finally the clown decides to sing a song, and although you cannot hear him, you can plainly see the donkey trying to accompany his master. This is an excellent picture for an encore.
