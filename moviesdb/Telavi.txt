Telavi

 A short 16mm film celebrating the folk music and landscape of the nation of Georgia. Shot in the city of Telavi in the summer of 2010, the film is a loose documentary, focusing on songmaster Suliko Tsimakuridze as he teaches songs from his village to a group of Georgian singers from around the world. It is also an homage to the city of Telavi itself, its architecture and empty spaces, its colors and sounds. Much of the film was shot at dawn, when the streets are inhabited only by teeming flocks of swallows, a natural counterpoint to the energetic polyphony of traditional Georgian folk song.
