Salar, the Leaper

 We go by rowboat up the New Brunswick's Miramichi River to catch Atlantic salmon with angler Lee Wolf and his guide Twirly Palmer. These salmon are a great fighting fish, leaping above the water, twisting furiously to try to shake the hook. We watch Wolf catch several - from 10 to 15 pounds plus one young fish - from the boat, from the shore, and, in waders, from the middle of the stream, sometimes using a long rod and sometimes a short one. It's catch and release for Wolf. An off-screen narrator comments on the origin of this fish and the techniques Wolf uses to hook, play, and net them.
