Slippage

 Slippage is the story of two women and their friendship. Laura, now tailored and straight, reunites with Ruth, an over-ripe hippie, after more than a decade-long estrangement, at Ruth's husband's funeral. Their deep connection is immediately rekindled, as they reminisce 'tripping' back to their commune days. Their lovely reunion quickly turns into a wild chase that ends in a shocking surprise.
