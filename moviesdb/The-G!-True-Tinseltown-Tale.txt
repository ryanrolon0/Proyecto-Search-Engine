The G! True Tinseltown Tale

 A parody of both "The E! True Hollywood Story" cable television series as well as the 2000 film "Dude, Where's My Car?" released by 20th Century Fox, where the filmmakers take a phony "behind-the-scenes" look at the making of "Dude, Where's My Car?" from the hilarious hijinks on screen to the deadly hijinks off screen.
