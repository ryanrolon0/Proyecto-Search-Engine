The Twisted Dreams of a Fixed Rider

 The twisted dreams of a fixed rider initiates us into the subculture of the London bike messengers and its alleycat-racing scene. Jean Marie has been a courier for the past ten years. Already notorious for organising illegal alleycat races in London, he and his sidekick Mike set out to bring the first ever alleycat to the traffic stricken boulevards of Paris. When Jean-Marie's ambitious expectations of the project collide with Mike's practical way of thinking, he starts to reasses his life.
