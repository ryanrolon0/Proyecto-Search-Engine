The Great Flood

 For thousands of years the Kawesqar people of southern Patagonia believed that their world was created after a catastrophic great flood. Today only 14 Kawesqar remain. The Great Flood recounts this ancient fable as the film follows the journey of one of the last members of this ancient race.
