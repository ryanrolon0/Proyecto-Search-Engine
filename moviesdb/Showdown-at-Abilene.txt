Showdown at Abilene

 Jim Trask, former sheriff of Abilene, returns to the town after fighting for the Confederacy to find everyone thought he was dead. His old friend Dave Mosely is now engaged to Trask's former sweetheart and is one of the cattlemen increasingly feuding with the original farmers. Trask is persuaded to take up as sheriff again but there is something about the death of Mosely's brother in the Civil War that is haunting him. The Civil War is over; former sheriff Jim Trask returns to Abilene, Kansas from the Confederate army, to find the town divided into nastily feuding cattle vs. farming factions, working up to a range war. Jim's friend, one-handed Dave Mosely, is now a cattle tycoon and about to marry Jim's girl Peggy. The situation begs for taking sides, but after the horrors of war, Jim can't bear to touch a gun again...
