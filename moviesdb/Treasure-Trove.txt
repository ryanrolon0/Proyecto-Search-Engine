Treasure Trove

 After finding a dusty book of treasure clues, Gary convinces his skeptical friend Carter to journey with him to the desert to find the Treasure of the Cursed Gypsy's Phoenix. Their adventures along the way include finding an abandoned waterpark, a shell shocked hair band roadie and learning lessons about how skepticism and positive thinking - while opposed - each hold their own benefits and pitfalls.
