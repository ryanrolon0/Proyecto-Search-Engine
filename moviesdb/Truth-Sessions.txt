Truth Sessions

 Truth needs to be told. Documentary filmmaker David Guilbault is committed to telling the stories of disenfranchised people who need their voices heard. This film, "Truth Sessions", is intended to be just the first in a series of studies of people coping with the common struggles of life. The questions are simple. The answers are honest. The conversations continue.
