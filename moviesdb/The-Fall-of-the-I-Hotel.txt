The Fall of the I-Hotel

 After the Manongs labored to build America, their San Francisco Manilatown community is wiped out by urban renewal, and 50 old-timers are forcibly evicted from the International Hotel by 300 cops in the dead of night. This film documents destruction of the last block of Manilatown in Kearney Street.
