We Invent You

 In a largely secular city such as Seattle, how do individuals develop the kinds of community traditionally provided by organized religion? Can they? 'We Invent You' explores how people in Seattle's vibrant DIY music scene foster community and meaning. The film provides a window into an integral, yet surprisingly unknown, part of a city celebrated for music and music culture. In the shadows of Bumbershoot, the EMP, Pearl Jam and Death Cab for Cutie, there is another music community seemingly devoid of marketing, advertising and profit. Is this community simply a byproduct of youthful energy or naivete? Is it a reaction to consumer capitalism? Or is this a movement a clarion call for Seattlites and Americans to take back their communities?
