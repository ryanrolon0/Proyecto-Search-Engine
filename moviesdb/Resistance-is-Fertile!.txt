Resistance is Fertile!

 Resistance is Fertile chronicles the journey of the South Central Resistance (SCR), a group of teenage renegades as they set out to reclaim and South Central Los Angeles through the art of Guerilla Gardening--the illicit cultivation of someone else's land. With every birth of a garden lies the chance that it will be transformed back into a barren wasteland at the hands of the city government. With the aid of several veteran LA-based Guerilla Gardeners, the SCR attempts its most ambitious mission to date The BIG DIG. Will the BIG DIG restore hope and revitalize a community or will it simply fall at the hands of the government and become another statistic? Join these environmental warriors as they green the hood for the good.
