Thackary's Time

 The life of a footloose, free-spirited Northern Californian takes a dramatic turn when his mother tells him that the man who raised him is not his biological father. Thackary Grossman, a 39-year-old occasional carpenter and surfer, sets out to discover a new father and define his own identity. How important is it to know your biological father? And what happens when you discover that he is not who you thought he was? These are the questions at the heart of Thackary's Time, a 54-minute documentary by Kathy Klausner and Beni Strebel.
