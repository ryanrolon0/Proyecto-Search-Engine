Shep Comes Home

 Little Larry Havens, whose father died in WWII, runs away from home to keep from being separated from "Shep," his father's dog. In Arizona, he is befriended by a kindly Mexican, Manuel Ortiz, who he is able to repay in time, with the aid of Sheriff "Cap" Weatherby, when Ortiz is suspected of crimes committed by local gangsters. "Shep" is instrumental in saving Ortiz from a lynching, and Larry, "Shep" and Ortiz all find a home with a couple they have befriended. After a young boy's mother dies, the authorities attempt to take custody of him and separate him from his beloved dog, Shep. The boy and the dog run away and head west, where they are befriended by a Mexican immigrant and later a small-town sheriff. When the sheriff is wounded in a robbery the Mexican is suspected of the crime, and the boy must catch the real culprits and clear his friend.
