Swimmer

 Working with fragments from a decayed super 8 film, Frozen Time (swimmer one from swimmer trilogy) 2010, shows a swimmer traversing a lap pool. The original sequence which only lasts for a few seconds, has been slowed by transforming each frame of the film into a still image and cross fading it.
