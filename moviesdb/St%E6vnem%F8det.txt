Stævnemødet

 Dating habits and scoring tricks are some of the ingredients in this modern love satire. Emma is looking for a man who is more chivalerous than lecherous. Albert is looking for yet another one-night stand, so he invites her out for dinner. Emma picks a Bulgarian restaurant where even the house wine is a serious matter. And things become even more serious when three gunmen enter the place. A memorable date for Albert.
