Ved verdens ende

 A policeman, Niels, lost his wife eight years ago in a traffic accident. Niels was driving the car. Ever since he has been tormented by grief and guilt. A case about a small girl who has escaped from a psychiatric hospital opens up old wounds. A series of coincidences leads Niels to believe that his wife has been reborn in order to avenge her death. Can he believe the things he sees, or is the pain driving him crazy? Has his brain run into a spiral of death or is there really more between heaven and earth than our human logic can embrace?
