The Captive God

 A little Spanish boy is shipwrecked and cast ashore in Mexico in the sixteenth century. Raised as a god by the Tehuan tribe, who have never before seen a white man, the boy is named Chiapa. At manhood, Chiapa rules the Tehuans. When the priestess Tecolote, whom he loves, is kidnapped by the Aztec warrior Mexitli, Chiapa follows in hopes of rescuing her.
