Run Robot Run!

 Ken Weston lives in the not-too-distant future and is not your typical human being. He is more organized than a day planner and more regimented than a Marine. With his goals of dating his pretty co-worker Allison and achieving a perfect daily routine almost realized, Kent's clockwork existence is thrown into disarray with the arrival of Adam - an all-too-human robot. Congenial and brilliant (not to mention, handsome), Adam wastes little time in ousting Kent from both his coveted job and Allison's affections. In his efforts to rid himself of his competition, Kent is confronted by his own mechanical nature and is challenged to do the one thing that humans find most difficult - change.
