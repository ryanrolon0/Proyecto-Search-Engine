Recovery

 Good information about mental health problems has the power to reassure, educate and empower at a difficult time in someones life. By the same token, poor information, or its absence, can cause frustration, distress and anger, especially if presented in technical, bureaucratic and impenetrable language. Michelle McNary's film explores the concept of recovery from mental health problems through the personal experiences of four people diagnosed with schizophrenia. A film telling real life stories about how people recovered their lives, in a format and style that is easy to understand, delivers a clear message of hope and inspiration. The film is also hosted on the famous Maudsley Hospital's website so anyone who needs to can watch it.
