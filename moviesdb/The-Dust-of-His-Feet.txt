The Dust of His Feet

 The film brings us into the world of two Bangladeshi folk musicians. Matal Rajjak Dewan, the 'drunk poet', is honoured with a shrine after his death. His student, Abdul Hai Dewan, calls his teacher 'my Allah' and continues to sing his songs of tolerance, mysticism and love at all-night celebrations and debates.
