To Have & Have More

 Nick McGuinness is a film student who's feeling lost. His girlfriend cheated on him, he hates going to class, and he feels like he has no purpose. His remedy? Together with his pill-popping producer/roommate, Nick gets his old friends back together to act in a romantic comedy that he will oversee. There's only one catch other. Plus, it's hard to concentrate when Nick's attention becomes more fixated on a potential love interest than the film itself.
