Taking Out the Trash

 While living for generations in the south's largest trailer park, The Widger family seemed happy with their lives. Then, when Bud Wideger won the Big Balls Lottery, their world turned upside down. Money would buy them many material things, but what they needed money couldn't buy. Being conned by a local swindler, Bud would invest and invest seeking the reputation as a hard working businessman. But around every corner of his investments always seemed to be a dead end. Soon, the family would have to make some important choices before there were no more options left.
