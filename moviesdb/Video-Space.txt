Video Space

 A group of video store employees in their early twenties aspire to one day work in the Hollywood film industry; but, merely dreaming of an unattainable future while surviving the mundane trials and tribulations of their small town society proves to be more challenging than expected. Video Space is a neighborhood video retailer that's run by the angst-stricken youth of the town. The five employees, Caleb, Ava, Jimmy, Stephanie, and Lucas, all dream of working in the film industry. Caleb, an aspiring screenwriter, dropped out of school in order to take care of his baby daughter Scarlett, whom he had with Sarah, a conniving and wretched woman. Ava has had a crush on Caleb since grade school and now that Cal is becoming dissatisfied with his domestic situation, possibilities are opening left and right. Jimmy is the neighborhood drug dealer who sells his product in the DVD cases at the video store. Customers might recognize Jimmy from the Talking Skateboard films he starred in as a child. Stephanie is a not-so-bright aspiring actress who will settle for any role. Lucas is the youngest, but hardest working, employee of the bunch. He's an aspiring film director who currently works 2 jobs store and another 40 hours a week at the video store. After an unfortunate event closes the store, Cal, Ava, Jimmy, Stephanie, and Lucas must all make the most important choice they'll ever have to make rest of their lives.
