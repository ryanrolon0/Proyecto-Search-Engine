The Devil's Box

 It all started with two catfish and a movie. Jason Hammond needed catfish for a movie, but nobody would sell him live fish. He finally came upon Kenneth Henneke Hatchery in Hallettsville, Texas. Henneke, a natural promoter, suggested making a film about his 'fiddle contest'. The rest is fish history. Hammond and producer Beth Jasper spent a over a year immersed in fiddle culture. Not musical themselves, they came to realize that fiddle wasn't just music, it was family. For hundreds of years, fiddle contests had been held all across the country, drawing contestants of all ages. And from the contests was born Texas-style fiddling. A tribute to fiddle music and the players who have passed it on, knee to knee, generation to generation.
