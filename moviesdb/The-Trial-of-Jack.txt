The Trial of Jack

 "The Trial of Jack" serves as an allegory of the times; it reminds us of the way things are "supposed" to be as opposed to how they often are in today's society. The film is from an imagined era of film history. It combines the style of the Expressionists of the late 1920s with the technology of the 1950s to create "3-D Expressionism."
