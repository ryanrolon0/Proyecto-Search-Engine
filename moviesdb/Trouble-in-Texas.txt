Trouble in Texas

 Tex is on the rodeo circuit looking for the men that killed his brother and he finds them in Middleton. Barker expects his man Squint to win the prize money but when Tex starts winning all the events, they put the poisoned needle in his halter rope, planning to have him mysteriously die just as the others did. It was re-issued by ScreenCraft Pictures with Rita Hayworth's name above the title. An inside joke has Yakima Canutt playing a henchman named "Squint Palmer", a name often used by player Tex "Squint" Palmer, who plays Henchman Duke in this film, is billed 5th in the cast and has exactly no lines. The film cast billing in this one gets stranger as Milburn Morante, playing a townsman with no name and exactly one line, is 8th billed as Milt Morndi; Fred Parker, as the 1st Sheriff with one scene and no lines is 7th billed, while Glenn Strange as the Middleton Sheriff with much footage and many lines is uncredited; and Buffalo Bill look-alike Tex Cooper is the Rodeo Announcer but billed as Tom Cooper. And the Bob Crosby in this film, in spite of some source that incorrectly thinks otherwise, is a well-known rodeo performer of the time from New Mexico named Bob Crosby and is not Bing's brother Bob Crosby (I). The Bob Crosby in this film has a stretch of highway between Roswell and Clovis,NM named for him... and Bing's brother doesn't. The plot has Tex Martin following the rodeo circuit trying to find the gang responsible for his brother's death, while Carmen Serano is an undercover agent (working with the gang) seeking evidence against a band of crooked promoters rigging the results of rodeo contests.
