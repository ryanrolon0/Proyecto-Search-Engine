Strait Up Dirty

 Markus Pukonen is an adventurer who is out to raise support and awareness for the urgent issues that are affecting the health of the Georgia Strait. Join him as he attempts to become the first person to stand-up paddleboard 60km from Vancouver to Nanaimo. Taking us on an audacious journey across the Strait we see him battling exhaustion and the marine weather. In speaking with the director of a local environmental organization, The Georgia Strait Alliance, we discover that most of Vancouver's sewage is simply strained through a primary screen and then flows right into the waters surrounding Vancouver. Markus places himself at risk in order to help the Georgia Strait Alliance to care for our waters. Will he be successful?
