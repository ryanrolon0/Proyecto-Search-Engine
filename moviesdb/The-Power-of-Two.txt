The Power of Two

 A feature documentary that tells the remarkable story of twin sisters, two cultures, and two new chances at life. Inspired by their 2007 memoir, the film offers an intimate portrayal of the bond between half-Japanese twin sisters Anabel Stenzel and Isabel Stenzel Byrnes, their lifelong battle with the fatal genetic disease Cystic Fibrosis, survival through miraculous double lung transplants, and improbable emergence as authors, athletes and global advocates for organ donation. Featuring expert interviews, archival footage and deeply personal testimony from the twins and others whose lives have been impacted by organ transplantation from the U.S. and Japan, the film provides unprecedented insight into the personal and societal aspects of this modern medical miracle affecting millions worldwide.
