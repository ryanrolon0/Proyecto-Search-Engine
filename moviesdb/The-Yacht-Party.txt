The Yacht Party

 It's daytime. Roger Wolfe Kahn and his orchestra perform for an audience of swells seated on the deck of a yacht. The orchestra plays several numbers, Gertrude Niesen sings, Melissa Mason does her loose-limbed dance, a handful of singers dressed as sailors and crewmen perform, then, in the sky, a barnstormer pilots a biplane through some loop de loops while the music plays and the audience gazes.
