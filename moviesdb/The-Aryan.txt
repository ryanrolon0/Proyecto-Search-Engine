The Aryan

 Steve Denton, rich from years of prospecting, is fleeced by the citizens of Yellow Ridge. In his rage, he kidnaps the woman most responsible and makes her his slave in a desert hideaway. He hates all white men (and women) and refuses to aid a wagon train of farmers dying in the desert... at least until he meets Mary Jane, an innocent and brave young girl among them.
