Sun Sessions

 "Sun Sessions," is The Teenage Head's most recent entry in the Rutherford B. Hayes High School saga. After Henry Marsh's bad breakup with his high school sweetheart Jane, the teenage Elvis fanatic enlists the help of his band-mates, The Guffmans, in order to win her back. But Jane's new fling, Brian, the football playing antithesis of Henry, will do whatever it takes to prevent that from happening. Deeply rooted in Americana, 'Sun Sessions,' takes a comedic stance on the strange period amid adolescence when the confusion surrounding ones first love comes to its breaking point. Instead of roses and chocolates, Henry and friends fashion a ceaseless onslaught of unconventional tactics, mixing both love and hate into an angst-ridden stew of juvenile emotion which climaxes in a crescendo of teenage debauchery and forces Henry to face the music and come of age, despite his grandeur dreams.
