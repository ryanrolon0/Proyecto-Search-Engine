Site Specific

 From a helicopter flying above Shanghai, Barbieri tells a silent story. Approaching the city from over the water, we see bright lights and color. Color gives way to gray. On the soundtrack, the noise of the helicopter alternates with marshal music, "The Orient Is Red." Edits are abrupt. Modern buildings contrast with a rail yard. A river bisects the city, crossed by a bridge of contemporary lines. Is there any sort of soul here?
