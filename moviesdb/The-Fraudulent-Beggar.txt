The Fraudulent Beggar

 A supposed blind man stands on the corner asking alms. An officer passes by and orders him off. He strikes the guardian of the peace, and throwing down his crutch, runs off. The policeman attempts to follow him, but trips over the tramp's crutch, and before he can rise the fraudulent beggar escapes.
