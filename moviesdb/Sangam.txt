Sangam

 Two Indian men strike up a conversation on the subway headed toward Coney Island - Vivek is US born but went to India as a youth and has distinct memories which leave him with longing; Raj is in the US only two weeks, has no family in New York, and needs work. Both are lonely in their own way. Can this chance encounter lead anywhere?
