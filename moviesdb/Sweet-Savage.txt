Sweet Savage

 A young Indian girl falls in love with a local white cowboy. The racist element in town doesn't approve of that, so they kidnap the girl and gang-rape her. The girl's brother hears about it, and he and other members of the tribe kidnap a white girl from town and gang-rape her. Things go downhill from there.
