Rudora no hihou

 Every 4,000 years, the head deity Rudra plans a rise and downfall of every race that graces the planet. The five races;the omni-pressant humans, the mermaid-like Mizushu, the wise Danan espers, the brave reptilian Hahchu-Rui and the mighty Kyojin Giants must overcome their differences and attempt to encounter Rudra himself.
