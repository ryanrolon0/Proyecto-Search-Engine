Sex, Drugs and Sausage Rolls

 Drama, Romance, Thriller, Mystery, Comedy and Tragedy. A feature film built up of six short overlapping stories. The most central of which is about two hired killers that have been sent to a house in order to kill someone. They have no idea who this person is and neither do we. As the stories unfold and we learn more about the characters, suspicion starts to build as to who this 'victim' will be?
