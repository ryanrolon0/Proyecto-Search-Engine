Tomi Knockers

 Couple Alan and Julie Ward pick up a foreclosure at a steal from the bank. But then their neighbors, Brian and Cassie Lynch, tell them what the bank failed to disclose. The former owner, an obsessively vain woman named Tommi Knockers, was so in love with her own image that she died after falling into a mirror. Tommi's restless spirit is now determined to recapture the pleasures of the flesh, by inhabiting the body of Julie Ward.
