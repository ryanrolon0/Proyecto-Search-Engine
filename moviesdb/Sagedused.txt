 Oliver, a yuppie, lives together with his paralyzed grandfather, whom he has to carry to the yard day after day and to the car to listen to the radio. The old man's sense of reality is mixed with the past and the Second World War, he stinks and talks to the radio - all this embarrasses Oliver. Lying about his grandfather complicates his relations with his girlfriend which leads to a tragic accident with the girl who slips into a coma.
