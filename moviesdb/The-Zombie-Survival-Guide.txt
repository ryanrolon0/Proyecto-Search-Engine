The Zombie Survival Guide

 The Zombie Survival Guide is a manual dealing with the potentiality of a zombie attack. It contains detailed plans for the average citizen to survive zombie uprisings of varying intensity and reach, and describes cases of zombie outbreaks in history, including an interpretation of Roanoke Colony. Scripted by the world's leading zombie authority, Max Brooks, Recorded Attacks reveals how other eras and cultures have dealt with-and survived-the ancient viral plague. By immersing ourselves in past horror we may yet prevail over the coming outbreak in our time.
