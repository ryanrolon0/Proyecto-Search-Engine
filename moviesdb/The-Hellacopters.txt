The Hellacopters

 The Hellacopters "Goodnight Cleveland" is a fly on the wall documentary following the Hellacopters on their 2002 tour of America. Informed by the techniques of cinema veritE and direct cinema developed in the 1960's by master documentary filmmakers, the band is allowed the space to do what they do without intrusions of any kind from the filmmaker, allowing for glimpses into the magical and mundane moments of everyday life in a hard working action rock band abroad. The Hellacopters relaxed and open-handed portrait of a band on the road. Essential viewing for anyone pondering a career in the music business, or anyone merely curious.
