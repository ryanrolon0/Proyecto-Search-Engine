Prison of the Psychotic Damned

 Five ghost hunters spend the night in "The Terminal" a long abandoned train terminal located deep in the heart of Buffalo's notorious East Side ghetto. The Terminal is said to be haunted by all those who have died within its cold stone walls. What begins as a joke turns into a terrifying nightmare as the five are assaulted by hordes of psychotic dead.
