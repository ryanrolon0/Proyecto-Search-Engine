Roald Dahl's Danny the Champion of the World

 Somewhere in England, in the Autumn of 1955, a widowed father and his son live an idyllic life together. Only their gas station happens to sit on a piece of land that a local developer wants to buy. And when he won't take no for an answer, and sets government inspectors and social works onto Danny and his father, Danny and his father decide to get even with Hazell and his pheasant- shooting friends in a manner in keeping with their own family tradition. Widowed veteran William Smith runs an English country gas station and car shop with his doted and devoted son Danny (9), a happy rascal. Their property is the last hole in filthy rich Victor Hazell's plan, allegedly a pheasant hunting estate. William, his pa's heir as master-poacher, abhors the unsporting rich man's hobby as much as moneybags Victor. Hazell sends every inspection he can find, but none resist the Smith boys' disarming charm. At the laid-back village school, Danny becomes new teacher Captain Lancaster's chosen whipping boy, but proves as a hard nut to crack as dad.
