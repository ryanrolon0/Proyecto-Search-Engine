The Prince and the Grail

 Few followers of the Templar Legacy are unaware of the story of Prince Henry Sinclair; the 14th century Scottish Nobleman who was the last Earl of Orkney and a kin to the man who built the famed Rosslyn Chapel. Sinclair, of Scottish and Viking lineage, was a true adventurer worthy of his combined heritage. In 1398 Henry Sinclair traveled across the sea to Nova Scotia - a century before the famed voyage of Columbus. Traces the transatlantic journey of Prince Henry Sinclair. Examines such topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Crusades, the Cathars, the bloodline of Christ theory and the Quest for the Holy Grail. Through the course of the film, the question is asked, "What is the Grail?" This question is answered through a comprehensive history of the Holy Relic and its possible connection to the Knights Templar. Unlike many documentaries, which use pan and scan pictures with a talking head voice over track, the Prince and the Grail uses location footage, costumed actors and interviews with experts on the topic.
