They Say Fiasco

 Mason is a deaf-mute projectionist. Carlson is a pill-popping psychiatrist. Cynthia is a sex-addict pharmacist. Art is a stuttering porn star with erectile dysfunction. Kennedy is a speech therapist with Tourette's. In a series of comic vignettes, They Say Fiasco follows the chain reaction of errors that crashes through each relationship in circular form.
