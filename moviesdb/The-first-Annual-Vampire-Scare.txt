The first Annual Vampire Scare

 Two boys go to the local cemetery on Halloween dressed as vampires. The plan, to scare the living shit out of anyone they find. The idea seems flawless but of course it couldn't be that easy, with the first person they find (the graveyard digger) actually thinking they're real vampires. Their lives are now in danger as he tries to hunt them down.
