Shiny Stockings

 'Shiny Stockings' is one the most recognizable swing tunes of all time. Yet, to the general public very little is known of the career of its composer and arranger, Frank Foster. 'Shiny Stockings' the movie is a unique approach to documentary film making. Weaving together the reminiscences of Dr. Foster, his friends, colleagues and former students, their opinions and impressions are presented against both facts and myths. 'Shiny Stockings' is a funny, entertaining and enlightening film. At once an improvised musical comedy and historical touchstone. An insider portrait told in the words of his friends, family and colleagues, scored with music by Dr. Foster in collaboration with Quincy Jones, Sarah Vaughn and Frank's own Loud Minority Big Band.
