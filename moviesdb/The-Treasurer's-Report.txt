The Treasurer's Report

 A club's formal dinner has been completed, and there is a pause in the entertainment so that the assistant treasurer can give the report of the club's finances for the year. He is noticeably ill at ease, and after making his initial points, he explains that he is filling in for the treasurer, who is too ill to give the report himself. The assistant treasurer then proceeds to go over the club's recent income and expenses.
