The Oatmeal Man

 Six best friends decide to make an impulse trip to Las Vegas in hopes of mending Santi and Annie's dying relationship. When Clive decides to stage a breakdown so Santi can "save the day", their truck "actually" breaks down in the middle of a long-ago forgotten ghost town. The eclectic group soon learns  about the old legend of "Harold Oates aka The Oatmeal Man" and find themselves in the middle of a blood thirsty killer's luring ground. Will the group make it through the night? Or will they become a breakfast topping?
