Straight White Men and Me

 Bisexual Asian director Antonia Kao takes us into the men's locker room, onto the ice rink, and in front of the TV for the Superbowl as part of her revealing, humorous, and poignant journey to figure out who "straight white men" are and who she is in relation to them. The "strange, somewhat frightening creatures" she interviews include anarchist; Chris, a wine salesman; Dave, a corporate golf-lover who looks like he stepped right out of the pages of GQ; Andy, a socially conservative family man; and Steve, an ex-Marine, ex-redneck, and ex-homophobe.
