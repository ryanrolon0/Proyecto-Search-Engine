River Red

 A young man (Tom Everett Scott) is placed in the position of having to kill his drunken, abusive father (Denis O'Hare) to protect his younger brother (David Moscow). Realizing that the younger brother will get off easier, he admits to the crime and goes to jail. Meanwhile the older brother finds his family deep in debt and he is unable to pay enough from his job as a dishwasher and selling wood. Thus he sets off on a series of robberies of convenience stores in adjoining towns. Back home, he tells everyone that he has come into a mild inheritance. However, he is racked with guilt and has trouble with a budding relationship because of this dark secret. The film's focus is on his struggle to determine his correct path.
