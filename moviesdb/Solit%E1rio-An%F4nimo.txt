Solitário Anônimo

 An elderly man lying on the grass waiting to die. In his pocket, a message announced that he was from a distant land. He had no documents or any possessions. His desire was to die alone and anonymous. This is the beginning of a documentary that tells the touching story of a man who was determined to plan and control his own death. It is a film about freedom, life and death.
