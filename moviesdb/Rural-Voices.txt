Rural Voices

 Rural Voices explores perspectives on homosexuality held by people living in rural British Columbia. Voices from three villages, an Aboriginal reserve and a Hare Krishna community span an array of occupations and ages to demonstrate the complexity of beliefs held in a typically conservative area.
