Suwapings

 Barrio Talong, the "Eggplant Capital of the Philippines," is governed by the deranged the deranged Mayor Como (Lou Veloso) who rules by the gun and steals for a living. Mayor Como embarks on a plan to dupe a group of Filipino-Americans into donating big dollars in exchange for the dubious honor of being named hometown heroes. But the plan goes awry when a concerned resident, Luis Macario (Noel Trinidad), decides to speak out and blow the whistle on the mayor. "Suwapings" is a satire on Philippine politics. It pokes fun at a number of social problems that hinder the Philippines from achieving genuine progress.
