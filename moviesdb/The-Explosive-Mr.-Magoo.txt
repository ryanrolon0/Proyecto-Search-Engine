The Explosive Mr. Magoo

 Mr. Magoo opens his newspaper and when he comes across an ad for bowling, he mistakes it for an alcohol ad using a picture of himself to endorse it. Furious, he heads to the newspaper office intent on suing them for libel. Along the way, he stops to purchase a mechanical wind up toy which he puts inside a box. When he arrives at the newspaper office, the employees there get the wrong idea when they notice the ticking box and flee Magoo taking time to call the bomb squad.
