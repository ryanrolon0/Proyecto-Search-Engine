 This hybrid Documentary / Musical is the story of Rachel Miller, a walking paraplegic who, though she can't feel her legs, is able to walk, dance, and sing. Rachel fell three stories while performing, and through a miracle of nature and determination, she taught herself to walk again. Though most days you can't tell, she's classified as a paraplegic. The documentary is a behind the scenes look at the making of the film musical written for Rachel by the director, and it's combined with the musical itself. Filming the musical takes its toll on Rachel's health, and on her friendship with the director. But, as in any good musical, it all works out in the end.
