Vietnam Minefield

 In 1967, a highly respected Brigadier was appointed to the most politically sensitive job in the Australian Defence Force - Commander, Australian Task Force, Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam. The controversial way he dealt with the determined and well-established enemy against the advice of experts and subordinates killed scores of Diggers and left hundreds more wounded. It was a huge military blunder. Now, based on the book 'The Minefield' by Dr. Greg Lockhart, archival records and interviews with those directly involved, for the first time we reveal the true, untold story of the Vietnam Minefield.
