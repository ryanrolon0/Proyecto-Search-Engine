Television's Vietnam

 Television's Vietnam, narrated by Charlton Heston, is a two-part documentary in which military experts, scholars, journalists and Vietnamese exiles contrast what actually happened in Vietnam with widespread myths and misunderstandings. It was produced by U.S. press watchdog group Accuracy in Media in response to angry protests from Vietnam veterans and Vietnamese exiles about Public Broadcasting's $5.6 million series, "Vietnam Television History." In addition to Heston, it features interviews with Accuracy in Media chairman Reed Irvine and Vietnam veterans including a young John McCain.
