The 'Imp'probable Mr. Wee Gee

 Famed crime photographer Arthur Fellig, nicknamed Mr. Wee Gee, stars as himself in this pseudo-documentary that begins when he falls in love with a store window dummy and tracks "her" to London, England, then meets up with a beautiful ghost in a haunted house and finally winds up in Paris, where he meets other beautiful women and ends up being chased onto the Eiffel Tower.
