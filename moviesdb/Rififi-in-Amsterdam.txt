Rififi in Amsterdam

 Bert Oliehoek returns home to his mother after serving a sentence of four years. Both the police and the underworld are keeping track of him, hoping he will lead them to his hidden treasures, a briefcase full of jewelery the Nazi's stole from the Jews during the second world war. Rival crook Blauwbaard sends his girlfriend Blonde Nelly to pry the information out of Bert, but Oliehoek decides to put everyone on the wrong trail. Four years ago criminal Bert Oliemans stole jewelry from former SS-man Mulder. It didn't go as planned. Oliemans was only able to hide the jewels just before he was arrested. Now Oliemans has served his sentence and returns to his mother, but his problems are far from over. He plans to move to South America with the money the jewels will generate on the black market, but how can he dig up the loot, with not one, not two, but three parties watching him? Not only does Mulder want the jewels back he stole from the Jews in World War Two, also rival criminal Blauwbaard and his gang are very interested in them and police chief Van Houthem wants nothing else than returning the jewels to their rightful owners. Oliemans hides in the house of his mother and together with his partners-in-crime De Bijenkorf and Lauwe Freek he tries to think of plans to dodge the 'bullets' Mulder, Blauwbaard and the police are firing at him.
