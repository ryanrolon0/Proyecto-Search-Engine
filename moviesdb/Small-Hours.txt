Small Hours

 After being away at college, 19-year-old Travis (Chaz Moore) returns home for the summer. Life in small-town Florida seems as mundane as ever. Once darkness falls, he meets up with an old friend Jeremy (Mark Malta), who hasn't achieved much since graduation. Together they travel to a party far outside of town. Travis finds himself stuck in a house full of questionable people including the unhinged homeowner Seth (Greg Nappo), and an old classmate with a crush, Lauren (Amanda Davison). The unusual events of the night feel unending for Travis as things seem to spiral out of control, but the stark light of morning is soon approaching.
