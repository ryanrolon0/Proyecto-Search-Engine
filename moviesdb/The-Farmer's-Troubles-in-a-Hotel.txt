The Farmer's Troubles in a Hotel

 A farmer comes to town and enters the office of a large well-known hotel. After having a heated argument with the room clerk, he is conducted to a room where he hides his pocket book under the pillow before going farther. After partially disrobing, he blows out the light and retires. He is annoyed by "the occupants" of the bed and arises to do battle with them. As he lights the gas, he notices a number of moving objects crawling up the wall. Seizing a lighted candle he holds it under each one of the "crawlers" when they immediately explode. He pulls the bed clothes to the floor and tries to obtain some rest in that manner, but to no purpose. A huge mosquito alights on his face, and scares him out of his wits. He endeavors in numerous ways to obtain rest. Failing to do so, he creates so much commotion that the porter of the hotel is sent to inquire the cause. Failing to give a satisfactory reason he is thrown bodily from the room. This is a funny picture all the way through, and will create roars of laughter.
