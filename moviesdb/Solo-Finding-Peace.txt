Solo Finding Peace

 Joe Baxter is your average 'Joe'. He decided to search for something that will bring us closer to true happiness...inner peace. Joe ventures into the wilderness by himself for a week to find inner peace through mindfulness, solitude and prayer. In these stressful, uncertain times local filmmaker/social worker, Joe Baxter of Westbrook, decided to make a documentary film about finding inner peace. In his filmmaking debut, Solo Finding Peace, Joe ventures by himself for a week into the wilderness of New York's Catskill mountains to find inner peace through mindfulness, solitude, and prayer. Along his journey he tries different techniques including, meditation, yoga, and deep prayer to access inner peace. "So many people get caught up in the day to day shuffle and sometimes lose sight of what truly makes them happy." Joe stated. Joe works as a social worker for the Department of Children and Families and sees so many people caring around so much burden. "This film is about my own personal journey, but I hope people can walk away from it thinking a little deeper about their own lives and what's truly important to making them happy." To prepare, Joe met with several experts to help guide him along through his journey. A yoga instructor, Buddhist monk, Christian bishop, and holistic physician have all contributed their expertise and perspectives regarding inner peace.
