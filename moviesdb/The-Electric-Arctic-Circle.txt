The Electric Arctic Circle

 At its simplest, The Electric Arctic Circle is a motorcycle excursion to the Arctic Circle captured on film, a generically American formula so familiar and true that it begs at every splice to be left alone to become the iconic motorcycle montage that should be its sovereign right. Yet, that would have only told half the story. The movie is in some final sense a transmission of whispers and groans from people on the edge of worlds, riding 1970s motorcycles to a space where fiction and reality most tangibly collide.
