Voices of Venice

 With the bells of the campanile clanging in the background, people are congregating in St. Mark's Square in Venice. Some Venetians reminisce about their history with the piazza and the city as a whole iron man strike the bell of the clock in the campanile, which was built in 1912, after the original crashed to the ground in 1902 from an earthquake; having a funeral procession through an adjacent canal for a grandmother on the day of the original campanile falling; seeing trees for the first time, which are scarce in the built-up area of the city; crossing some of the four hundred bridges in the city, the largest being the Rialto; working hard as a gondolier, a job made more lighthearted with a serenade; and living without automobile traffic. And today, some are making their own memories, one being a small child whose pants just won't stay up. Citizens of Venice, in accented English, guide us through their city. It's Palm Sunday, and crowds gather in Piazza San Marco. Children and adults feed pigeons, people come from Mass carrying small branches, a father helps a toddler hitch up his drooping pants. An old man recalls listening to the clock strike atop the church when he was a boy, and the earthquake of 1902 that felled the campanile. A woman recalls her grandmother's funeral more than 40 years ago; the cemetery was the first place she saw trees. We see the Rialto Bridge and hear a gondolier sing. A balloon man, a child in a toy car, and the crowd singing in the piazza conclude the voices and the visit.
