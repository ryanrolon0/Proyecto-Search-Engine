Tiny Dancer

 Lauren Drake's life as the principal dancer for the Hudson Ballet Theatre Company has come to an end. It wasn't high profile scandal, drug use, or injury... it was three words best friend Sheila, Lauren is determined to make a stage comeback and will do whatever it takes to regain the life she used to know. Under the tutelage of her old flame, the Company's charismatic artistic director Anton, she seems bound for the top once again. But with her family drifting away while she pursues her dream, she must decide if regaining her life on-stage is worth losing everything she loves.
