RehEn de Ilusiones

 Pablo is a 60 years old writer. He meets by chance an ex pupil, Laura. Now, she is an attractive 35 years old woman. She was very much in love with him, when he was her professor at college. Now, she bursts into his life, as a passionate lover. He rediscovers his sexuality and the illusion of being young once more. But Laura seems to suffer a psychotic brake. She feels chased by the porter and militarism from the neighboring barracks. Laura is put in an asylum, but from time to time, Laura will appear and disappear, becoming someone ethereal, like a picture from an unrecoverable youth.
