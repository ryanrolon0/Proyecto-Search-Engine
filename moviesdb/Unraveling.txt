Unraveling

 Unraveling knits together thousands of still images animating Marie's memories. Old photographs, found footage, and 35 mm slides project in the background, illustrating the history that surrounds these memories. Today, Marie is an aging woman. She is a strong woman, with many experiences, much wisdom, and tremendous strength. Though her memories might be tangling and her life unraveling, her experiences are filled with life.
