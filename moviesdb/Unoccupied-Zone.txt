Unoccupied Zone

 Philosopher, trade-unionist, mystic. Following the 1940 German occupation of Paris, Weil is forced to leave for the "unoccupied zone" of southern France. Under Vichy, she is denied the right to teach. For two years, she waits, she says, for God. We may never know Simone Weil. We must, however, contemplate her.
