Rector's to Claremont

 A large group of diners leaves Rector's restaurant in New York City, and climbs into a carriage. One man, however, has been left behind. He dashes out of the restaurant and runs after the carriage, pursuing it through the streets. At one point, he catches up with it and grabs hold of the back of the carriage, only to lose his grip and fall off. So he must once more renew his efforts.
