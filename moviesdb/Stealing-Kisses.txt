Stealing Kisses

 David has been living in his own little hell. Three weeks ago, he was supposed to be married to the love of his life. Just before the ceremonial kiss, she walks away and he is alone. As a result, David has shut himself up in his room. He has talked to no one. He hasn't showered and has barely eaten. All the time, he is watching the video tape of his wedding, particularly the part where his bride-to-be doesn't kiss him. He watches it over and over again. David's friends don't know how to help him, but they try. His best friend and roommate finally decides to intervene. He coerces him out of the apartment and David finds himself in the world as if for the first time. He walks aimlessly about until he sees a girl on the "El". He looks at her and imagines his fiancE. He imagines kissing her. And then, to his surprise, he realizes that he is, in fact, kissing a stranger. He runs away, but his compulsion continues. He keeps kissing beautiful women all over the city. How will he ever stop this obsession?
