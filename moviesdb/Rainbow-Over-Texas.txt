Rainbow Over Texas

 Roy visits his home town while on a personal appearance tour. While there he enters a pony express race. To keep him from winning, bad guys try to sabatoge Roy's entry. They fail, or course. Songs include the title song and "Smile for me, Senorita." Saloon owner Haynes has one of his men rob his own place dressed as Jim Pollard. Roy wounds the robber in the arm before he escapes. When Roy finds Pollard he finds him unwounded and hides him out. But later Pollard is brought in shot in the back. Roy must now find the man with the wounded arm.
