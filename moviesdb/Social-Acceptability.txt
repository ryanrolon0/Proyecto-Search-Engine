Social Acceptability

 Shy and slightly awkward Marian wants desperately to be accepted into the social circle that directs everything at her high school. Rod, the rich star athlete and the leader of that circle, has everything in his favor to be popular. Ben, although from a lower social class, is part of the group because he has an outgoing personality. Susie, who used to be friends with Marian, fits in the middle of the group - not the most popular or as rich as Rod, and not as outgoing as Ben, but she possesses enough of each of those attributes to be accepted. And there are others like Jerry who isn't part of the group, but doesn't want to be. Susie is having a party, to which Marian has not yet been invited. Malcolm and Evelyn, Marian's parents, talk about Marian's social development. Marian takes after Evelyn, who admits her own insecurities and how that in turn may affect Marian's development, while Malcolm is worried that not being accepted may scar Marian for life. Although the party in and of itself is not important, it does act as a symbol for Marian's social acceptance or lack thereof. Marion Ellsworth is a cute, perky, and shy girl who can't seem to make friends no matter how hard she tries. Surrounded by vicious peers, "drippy" parents, and other misfortunes of teen life, she contemplates completely abandoning any effort to get along with her peers, and is punished for it by the producers of this movie.
