Rodeu-mubi

 Suk-won, a trader who loses all of his money (and his wife) in a market downturn is left homeless until Dae-shik, a homeless loner, rescues him. Together the two travel across the country and Dae-shik falls in love with Suk-won. Joining them in their journey is Il-joo, a wacky hooker who falls in love with Dae-shik. Dae-Shik is a gay homeless man on the streets of Soel. He finds a suicidal ex-financier Suk-Won on the street. Suk-Won's business has failed and his wife has thrown him out. The two hit the road together to find work, but instead find Il-Joo , a prostitute. Il-Joo is attracted to Dae-Shik. Dae-Shik is attracted to Suk-Won. And Suk-Won is not gay. When he turns to Il-Joo for comfort, the triangle is complete.
