Santa Holocaust

 Santa's been keeping a close eye on the world, but when everyday immorality keeps getting worse, he decides it's time to take matters into his own hands... And he's doing it with a shotgun. Aided by Kiwi, his closest elf friend, and Mrs. Clause, Santa tries to take down the infamous King Pin of crime, Vince Chandler by working his way from petty gangs, to the top of the pyramid in an all out action packed story filled with joy, good fortune, and ass kicking.
