Red Grooms

 Red Grooms has made a ruckus in the arts for almost half a century. An artist best known for his pop art constructions and for whom the unique terms "sculptopicturamatist" has been coined. Painter, sculptor, printmaker, filmmaker, and theatrical showman-take a walk through Grooms' cheerfully satirical, cartoon-like style, and witness him creating exuberant works swarming with boisterous life.
