We Can Still Be Astronauts

 Director Jinx Rhodes looks at how her fathers' unrealized childhood dream of becoming an astronaut has influenced his adult life. Through her fathers' experience and interviews with people whose career goals started down one path and ended up on other, Jinx learns how to reconcile childhood dreams with the realities of adulthood. Originally created as an entry for the 2010 International 5-Day Documentary Challenge, this short documentary took on a life of it's own. The filmmakers did not meet the contest deadline or time limit, but saw the project through as a labor of love and a unique reflection on what it means to dream big.
