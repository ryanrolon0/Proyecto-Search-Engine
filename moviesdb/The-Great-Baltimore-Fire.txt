The Great Baltimore Fire

 Showing a true picture of that great conflagration where the entire business portion of the City of Baltimore was totally destroyed, but fortunately no lives were lost. This was the first moving picture taken of the ruins, and shows them heavily coated with ice, the fire having broke out in mid-winter on a Sunday afternoon, and continued to burn for about ten days. The National Guard of Maryland are seen patrolling the streets to keep strangers from falling into danger.
