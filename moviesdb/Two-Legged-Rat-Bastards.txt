Two-Legged Rat Bastards

 A short film based on the story by Daniel Wallace (Big Fish) detailing the strange estrangement of an elderly father and his son. Set on a park bench in the present day, Eddie, a cantankerous old alcoholic, attempts to connect with his son Winstead, who's spent the majority of his adult life trying to get away from him. In the course of their conversation Eddie reveals how he lost his leg - in a high stakes poker game 30 years ago.
