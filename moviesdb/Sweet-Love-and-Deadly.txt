Sweet Love and Deadly

 The brutal, obsessive ex-lover of a stripper returns to her from prison. Unwilling to ask her cop friend for help, her rich lover is no help so she seduces a coke dealer she hates to kill the ex-con and ends up framed for a murder she didn't commit. Her feminine wiles can't extract her from this disaster.
