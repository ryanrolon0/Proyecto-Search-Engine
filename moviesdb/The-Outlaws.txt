The Outlaws

 Eugene Griswold is an average, suburban nine-to-five guy tired of working long hours for his income. Then Eugene gets mixed up in his inventor friend Stanley Flynn's get-rich-quick scheme which lands them both in prison and eventually leads to a series of misadventures when they are caught up in a bizarre prison breakout made by other prisoners which they are blamed for mastermining it and now must run from the law.
