Sommerreigen

 "Sommerreigen" is a tragic comedy, based on the stage play "Der Reigen", written by Arthur Schnitzler, a Viennese dramatist, living around the beginning of the 20th century. The four different characters Sandy, Kurt, Lucy and Fandango find each other in a circle of tragedy and comedy, fun and suspense, lust, love, erotic and desire. And nobody knows, which effects these meetings will have on each off them.
