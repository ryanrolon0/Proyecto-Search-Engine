Sister Kenny

 Elizabeth Kenny, as a young nurse out in the Australian bush discovers an effective treatment for polio, but can't get official recognition or sanction for her techniques and theories. For more than three decades (while she tells her fiancEe she can't marry him, and repeatedly confronts the pigheaded orthopedic specialist Dr. Brack), she is prevented from treating acute cases and is ridiculed, while she seeks formal recognition for the efficacy of her treatment. Fictionalized account of the famed Australian Elizabeth Kenny whose revolutionary treatment for polio was hailed by many as the next best treatment to a cure itself. As presented in the film, Kenny came across her treatment of hot compresses and physiotherapy quite by accident. She almost immediately runs into the prejudice of the medical profession with the sole exception of a family medicine practitioner, Dr, McDonnell. She serves as a nurse in Europe in World War I and on her return to Australia has every intention of giving up nursing and marrying her longtime beau, Kevin Connors. She is drawn back into her work by the plight of the children she sees and sacrifices her personal life for the sake of her patients. After many years she eventually travels to the United States where she faces the same uphill battle against the medical profession. After several years, she eventually receives a more positive reception by some in the profession.
