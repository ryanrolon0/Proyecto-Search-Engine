The Story of a Glove

 When a young husband goes off to a college reunion party, his wife leaves one of her gloves in his coat pocket to remind him to come home early. When he finally does return home--late, as always--he pulls out the glove in front of his wife and, not knowing that it was hers to begin with, starts making up a story about how it got there.
