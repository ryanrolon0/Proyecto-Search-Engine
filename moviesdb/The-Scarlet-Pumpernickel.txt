The Scarlet Pumpernickel

 Daffy tries to sell movie studio head J.L. his script for a swashbuckler set in Merry Olde England, a plot involving a maiden in distress, a scheming Chamberlain, an evil Grand Duke and a dashing masked hero (to be played by Daffy, of course). Tired of comedy roles, Daffy Duck sells studio chief J.L. on a 2,000-page script to a swashbuckling adventure in 18th century England. The adventure involves The Scarlet Pumpernickel, a good-natured desperado who covets the hand of Lady Melissa, the ward of the evil Lord High Chamberlain. The Lord High Chamberlain decides to lure Scarlet into a trap by forcing the marriage of Lady Melissa to The Grand Duke, which leads to a wild chase and sword fight. Daffy's script calls for miscasting such as Sylvester Cat as The Grand Duke and Porky Pig as Lord High Chamberlain and even at 2,000 pages the script isn't finished when Daffy makes his pitch, forcing him to improvise an apocalyptic ending that leaves him muttering about the difficulty of selling a story in Hollywood.
