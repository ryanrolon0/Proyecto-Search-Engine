Summer's Blood

 The rebellious teenager, Summer Matthews, finds out her mother's secret - her unknown father is alive - and she decides to seek him out. She hitchhikes to a small village called Massey with an old picture of her father, expecting that someone might identify him. When she arrives in the community, she shoplifts from a store but the local sheriff sees her and chases her. However Tom Hoxey helps her to flee and they go out on date that night. Tom takes her home where he lives with his mother, Gaia, and they have one night stand. The next morning, just as Summer is ready to go, she finds out that Tom is not quite the perfect gentleman.
