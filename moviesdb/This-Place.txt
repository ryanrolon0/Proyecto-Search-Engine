This Place

 What began as a curiosity about the roadside memorial markers and the idea of beauty in the grieving process eventually led to a documentary that features three families that lost young people unexpectedly and have chosen to honor them and their grief via memorials placed at their place of death. Two of the young people died in car accidents, and their families maintain crosses at the scene of the accident. The third was a victim of teen dating violence; her mother and best friend maintain a garden at the place where her body was found. The film features interviews with parents and friends as well as documenting one mother constructing the cross and placing it at the crash site. Another scene captures a mother and best friend tending the memorial garden where her daughter's body had been found by a neighbor's dog.
