The Beauty Show

 This is exceedingly funny and will appeal to you as a novelty. It is just what its name implies and shows the beauties three of whom are smoking cigarettes and flirting with the men in the audience. The consolation prize is rich and you want a film of this kind to keep your audiences convulsed with laughter.
