Secret War

 During the Second World War the Canadian government experimented on its own soldiers at a remote base in the Alberta prairies. Had these tests been done on enemy soldiers they would be labeled as war crimes. Secret War is the story of four Canadian soldiers, out of more than two thousand, who between 1941 and 1945 volunteered to be human guinea pigs, testing deadly mustard gas at Suffield, Alberta. The soldiers tell us in their own words about the tests they underwent in gas chambers and open fields.
