The Poet of Baghdad

 This is the story of one of Iraq's most famous poets, Nabeel Yasin.  When he was a young student in Iraq, officers from Saddam Hussein's regime stamped the words Enemy of the State on Nabeel's passport for writing politically sensitive poems and daring to read them in public. Banned from the University and unable to find work or travel abroad, he found himself trapped by Saddam's cruel and savage regime. The harassment he suffered extended to many members of his family, who were also repeatedly arrested and tortured. In 1979, after a series of attempts on his life, Nabeel managed to flee into an uncertain exile in one European city after another. His epic poem Brother Yasin Again, a sequel to the controversial Brother Yasin, which had landed him in so much trouble in 1974, was smuggled back into Iraq. It became a powerful underground anthem of resistance against Saddam's tyrannical rule. Nabeel was not able to return Iraq until Saddam's overthrow. Despite the great danger, he decided to go back and help put his shattered homeland back together.
