The Elm Tree

 Jonathan Burch has worked hard to provide a stable life for his family. Tucked away in a remote region of Texas, he has succeeded in keeping them sheltered from the devastation of America's political turmoil. His relationship with his young son is budding, his marriage steady and strong. But when Jonathan's father, Harlin; a union-sympathizer on the run for his reign of terror across the land, unexpectedly arrives, wounded and seeking shelter, he imposes a fatal threat to the family's peaceful solitude. With the Confederate militia on the other side of the horizon, Jonathan and Harlin struggle to resolve loose ends. Already confronting the shadows of his own past, there is no preparing for the decision Jonathan will soon be forced to make.
