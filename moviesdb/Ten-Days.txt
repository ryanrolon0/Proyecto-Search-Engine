Ten Days

 An unfamous band on a ten day tour. its about life on the road, playing in different venues every night trying to spread the word of your music. its not knowing where you'll be resting your head every night. its about friendships formed and reconnected on the road. its the landscape of the northwest floating by from looking out a van window. its sharing space 24/7 with four other musicians. its visual translation of the emotions of songs captured on film. its a film about terese taylor, an artist with a strong voice trying to be heard.
