Seed of Doubt

 As Ginger sits alone in a small-town diner, she runs across Avis Rand, a man with whom she'd had an affair 30 years earlier, when she was a high school cheerleader and he was the coach of the football team. Their conversation reveals his lifelong pattern of lecherous behavior, and soon they are joined by Ginger's attractive 20-something daughter, Carrie Ann. Setting his next conquest in his sights, Avis turns on the charm as Ginger does her best to diffuse the situation. When Carrie Ann steps away to take a phone call, Ginger warns Avis to stay away from her daughter, but Avis seems undeterred. Ginger finally suggests to Avis that he is the girl's father, although she has no proof of his paternity. However, the strong possibility that he is Carrie Ann's father is enough to send Avis on his way, now with an amount of newfound respect for Ginger.
