The Holy Deuce

 The story of a hard working grad student, his two couch-dwelling friends, and the virgin-Mary-shaped-poop that appears in their toilet and eventually tears their world apart. As masses flock to their doorstep and a scatological cult begins to worship "he who left it" as a dark messiah, the 3 roommates find themselves embroiled in a holy war the likes of which has never been seen.
