The Rider of the Law

 Bob Marlow is sent undercover to an Arizona town where an outlaw gang, comprised of the six Tolliver brothers, have taken over the town and terrorizing the citizens. He comes to town, posing as an Eastern dude, and, through a series of incidents manages to get rid of three of the brothers, mostly through their own ineptness. The remaining brothers decide to get-while-the-gettin'-is good, rob the bank and head for the Mexican border. But Bob isn't far behind. Marshal Bob Marlow arrives in Apache City posing as a dude. The six Tolliver brothers are running wild and when Bob fights with two of them they accidently shoot each other. Then a third brother goes after him and is accidently shot when they fight. When Bob's identity is revealed, the other three and the rest of the gang rob the bank and flee. No longer a dude, Bob organizes a posse to go after them.
