The Glitter Emergency

 In this silent film comedy set to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, Peggy the Peg-Leg Ballerina languishes at home with her evil stepsisters, dreaming of a life on the stage. Dancing Pixies and a violinist in 7-inch platforms pursue her in a screwball chase through the streets of San Francisco that ends in Peggy's triumphant dance at the ball.
