Popeye's 20th Anniversary

 Popeye is being honored for his 20 years of films, in a dinner hosted by 'Bob Hope' (qv) (several other celebrities are present, like 'Jimmy Durante' (qv), 'Bing Crosby' (qv), 'Jerry Lewis' (qv) and 'Dean Martin' (qv)). When called on to make a speech, he instead shows clips from two of his movies. Bluto does a slow burn through this, finally stuffing Popeye's trophy onto Popeye's head - but the trophy is full of spinach, so Popeye clobbers Bluto.
