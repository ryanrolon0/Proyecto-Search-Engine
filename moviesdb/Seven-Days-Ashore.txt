Seven Days Ashore

 Dan Arland, a womanizing playboy, is looking forward to a seven day leave in his home town of San Francisco with one of two beautiful violinists playing for an all-girl swing band but can't decide which of the two gorgeous gold-diggers he wants to squire around the City by the Bay. Through a series of unusual circumstances both girls, as well as his former fiancEe, show up to meet him when he arrives. As both musicians believe they are engaged to him, Dan fears he may become part of one or more "breach of promise" lawsuits. Faking an old war injury, he enlists the help of bumbling shipmates Monty and 'Handsome,' who pose as millionaires in order to distract the girls with unforeseen results.
