The Revenge Rider

 When Tim learns that Harmon has shipped rustled cattle under his ranch's brand, he puts him in a locked room to confess and name Kramer as the man that forced him to do it. Tim returns to find the room locked from the inside, Harmon on the floor, and a suicide note on the table. He now has to prove that it was murder and Kramer is guilty.
