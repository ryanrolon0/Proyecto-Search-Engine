The Last Visit

 A short film about a Queer Jew bringing her lover home to meet her grandma. The story is a poetic nigun dedicated to reconciling relationships past and present, and to peace in the beauty of the land. As the north american Jewish community's attachment to a Jewish homeland in Israel plays out as erasure and genocide of the Palestinian people, this is a film about creating home and hope inside of ourselves.
