The Retelling

 11-year-old Charlie Mason and his family take a summer trip to take care of his ailing and blind grandfather. Soon after their arrival, Charlie and his older sister Margaret begin to sense an unsettling presence around his grandfather's house. Even more mystifying to the children is that their grandfather takes routine walks to an abandoned part of town. He claims to meet friends there to play music. Feeling these things are somehow connected, Charlie and his new friend Anne commit themselves to finding the link. The outcome is more than they expected, for a murder from the past has finally found its connection to the present.
