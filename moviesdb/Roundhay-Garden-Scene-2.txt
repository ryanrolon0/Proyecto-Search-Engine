Roundhay Garden Scene 2

 In an effortless recreation of early attempts of objective reproduction of human behavior the narrative expounds on the relativistic trauma present in the lack of simultaneity of events. The existentialistic approach provides a dissertation by the characters as viewed from a topological undefined location in semantics and logistics. Greatly emphasized by experiment in phrenology in the natural settings of this English garden.
