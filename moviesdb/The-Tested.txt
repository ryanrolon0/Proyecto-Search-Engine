The Tested

 A black teen struggles with schoolwork in a hostile environment, and his home life, which is equally disturbing. During the days before his gang initiation he attempts to make peace with his negligent mother, console his younger sister, and accept what he's about to do-shoot a stranger in broad daylight. This film tackles the injustice of poverty and the cycle of violence in an up-close and personal way. Ultimately, the choices the character's make, go beyond what is right in front of them.
