The Mayor Elaine Scruggs Chocolate Football Challenge

 Glendale Arizona Mayor Elaine Scruggs offers up a humorous two minute challenge to Philadelphia's Mayor Michael Nutter during the playoffs heading to the 2009 Super Bowl.. Mayors' challenges are one of Super Bowl's traditions and Ed Sharpe was there to report on and record this event which was part of a memorable season for the Arizona Cardinals and the City of Glendale.
