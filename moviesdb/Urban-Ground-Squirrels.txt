Urban Ground Squirrels

 Urban Ground Squirrels is the hilarious tale of love, friendship, and experiences set against the battlefield of a modern college campus. From classrooms to dorm rooms, it's hard to keep it together when you can't even find the door. This weekend-sized slice of college life follows the amusing escapades of Adam Parker and his three closest friends. They, like many college under-achievers, prefer to spend most of their time going to parties, playing video games, and attending the occasional class. This particular weekend strays from the usual when Adam meets a girl at a party (a simple incident which drives his best friend to the brink of a jealous rage). As this bizarro weekend unfolds, we see exactly what Adam has to do to preserve his sanity and his friendships. It never hurts to have the aid of a mind-reading squirrel - too bad Adam doesn't know any!
