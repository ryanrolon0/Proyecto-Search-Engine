The Parisienne and the Prudes

 The never released film played only at the Cannes Film Festival. Ostensibly an examination of McCarthyism, the plot is about a married couple from New Yorker City who escape the blistering summer heat by visiting a New Jersey nudist colony. When the husbands' boss finds out, he tries to entrap him.
