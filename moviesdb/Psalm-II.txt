Psalm II

 Imagine a rusted, medieval film can having survived centuries, a long lost D. W. Griffith (qv) / Georges MElies (qv) co-production, a film left to us from the Bronze Age, a time when images were smelted and boiled rather than merely taken, when they poured down like silver, not to be fixed and washed, but free to form and coagulate into unstable, temporary molds, mere holding patterns of faces, places, and things, shape-shifting according to whim.
