The Other End of the Line

 Struggling to convince his new hotelier client, Kit Hawksin, Granger Woodruff is told by one Jennifer David that his identity has been compromised, and his credit card is being misused. While tracing transactions, both become friendly and agree to meet in San Francisco at the Hawksin Hotel. She does not show up, and Woodruff befriends an East Indian woman, Priya Sethi, who has come to attend a relative's marriage. Woodruff will get a rude awakening when he finds out that Priya is actually Jennifer - who is the fiancE of wealthy Mumbai-based Vikram Bhatia - and has traveled there without informing her family. He will also incur her dad's (Rajeev) wrath, who has been compelled to travel there, along with his wife, Manju, to first locate, and then escort Priya back home to get her married to Vikram.
