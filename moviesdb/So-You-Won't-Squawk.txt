So You Won't Squawk

 The handyman is finishing getting the Island Inn CafE ready for opening night the local mob kingpin, Slugger McGraw, not to open. When Slugger's thugs arrive at the Island Inn, they think the handyman is Louie. Louie promotes this case of mistaken identity, and our poor innocent faces a series of dangerous situations. When he finally learns that the thugs (and Louie) are up to no good, he must think fast to save his neck. Louie "the Wolf" is an ambitious mobster out to expand his empire; Buster Keaton is a humble employee helping decorate Louie's new restaurant. But when the heavies from a rival mob come calling, it is Buster who inadvertently saves the day and is mistaken for Louie himself -- a deception which the latter decides to promote further for his own ends. After numerous narrow escapes from death, Buster discovers his boss's true motives and decides by hook or by crook to bring enough policemen to the restaurant to get him arrested...
