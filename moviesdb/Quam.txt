Quam

 A man loses his wife in an accident in which he survives. In order to suppress a strong sense of guilt, he falls into a state of depression and addiction to alcohol and drugs. Until a friend - who works as a computer designer for Quam, a company specialized in mental treatments based on an advanced form of virtual reality - broaches a proposal... It's the beginning of a nightmare.
