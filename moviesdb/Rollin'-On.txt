Rollin' On

 ROLLIN' ON is a film about Skateboarding, hard work and perseverance. The film tells the story of a group of young people who regularly meet at Finsbury Park skate-park. Its main narrative is given by an interview with legendary skateboarding champion Tony Hawk, in which he tells the story of his first rolling steps into the world of skateboarding and how much skateboarding contributed to changing his life from bullied shy boy and outsider to revered professional skateboarding champion and video game character. This inspirational film draws a parallel between the lives of the young skateboarders in Haringey and their hero. The film touches on themes such as bulling at school, social barriers and prejudice, as well as investigating weather skateboarding could offer a viable alternative to gun, knives, street crime in general and boredom.
