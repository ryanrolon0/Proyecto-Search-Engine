Traumatic 73

 Camargo owns a washing machine that his colleague Salazar is crazy about Traumatic 73. What he doesn't know is that this washing machine also wants him! Traumatic 73 uses elements of Black Comedy and Absurd to satirize the peculiar dependence people develop over electrical home appliances, to the point of turning it into a fetish. Filmed in 10 different built sets that accurately describe the characters, Traumatic 73 unfolds the mystery inside the old man-devouring Traumatic model 73 washing machine.
