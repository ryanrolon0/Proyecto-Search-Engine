Prison Warz

 In what is probably a prison warehouse, windowless, two men in orange jumpsuits do battle in hand-to-hand kung fu with two men dressed in the black and white uniforms of another prison. The fight is to the death. Awaiting the winners is the arrival of an Asian fighter in his own prison's uniform. He's a kung fu dervish. Are our initial victors outclassed? And, what will the winner of this fight get?
