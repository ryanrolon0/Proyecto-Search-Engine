Range Riders

 Sutton sends for his son Dick to help fight the Crawford gang. Posing as a Mexican he continually outsmarts them. But they finally capture him just as Crawford steals a map to a gold mine from his girlfriend Elsie. An outlaw gang is terrorizing the town and local ranchers, so old John Sutton sends a letter to his college-attending son, Dick, to come home and take care of the varmits. Gang leader "Bull" Crawford and his motley crew of henchmen make plans to meet Dick when he arrives. The man they meet is a sappy-looking young man who arrives loaded down with tennis racquets, golf clubs, butterfly nets and other paraphernalia the outlaws associate with saps, boobs and broke-back tap dancers. They figure they have nothing to fear from old "Dad" Sutton's pride and joy. Rancher's daughter Elsie Waldron doesn't think so, either.
