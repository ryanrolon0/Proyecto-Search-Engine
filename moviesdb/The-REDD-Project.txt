The REDD Project

 Papua New Guinea has one of the world's fastest disappearing rain forests. An Australian team of scientists and environmental activists travel to Oro Province, Papua New Guinea to begin REDD projects to help save what has become crucial to our planets future. The team must travel through deep jungle terrain to visit tribes and inform the people of this unique opportunity. It becomes difficult to introduce such a complex concept to a gathering of clan leaders and tribesman who speak many different languages. The REDD projects will help save the forests and retain ancient tribal cultures. We can only hope that the people of Oro Province will take the first step toward a green future.
