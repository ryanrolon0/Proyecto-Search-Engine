The Force

 The film starts with the mystery of a burnt body lying in a English cornfield on an idyllic summer's day. The police know their victim has been strangled, her body carried in a suitcase to a remote field and then set alight; but not who she, or her killer is. Then they find a witness, who's seen a battered car being driven around the crime scene, the day before the killing. Offender profilers advise whoever chose that lonely spot knew the area. A database search of car registrations throws up four names, one of them with a Hampshire bank account. The chase is on. As Ziaul Haque is arrested at his workplace, a London hotel, the manager mentions that one of his staff is missing, a Polish girl - Sylwia Sobczak. Sylwia and Ziaul were having an affair. There's a frantic race against time to gather evidence. Ziaul's saying Sylwia is uncontactable because she's on holiday in her native country. The search is hampered by technology that won't allow the police to type the word murder, the DNA swabs that repeatedly fail to confirm her identity, the CCTV cameras that don't track her movements, and won't reveal the place she died. Then an eerie breakthrough down the steps of the block where he lives hours before Sylwia's body is discovered. Haque is confronted with the images - The shame is too great. A day later he hangs himself.
