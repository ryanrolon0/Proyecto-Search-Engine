Slipping Through the Cracks

 Slipping through the Cracks takes a heart-wrenching look at our child welfare system and the children it is supposed to protect. The film follows children like little Sarah Chavez, a beautiful toddler who never made it to her third birthday. Dozens of abused and neglected children died in Los Angeles last year, often in their own homes. These tragedies underscore a gaping hole in our safety net. Worst of all, many of these deaths could have been prevented. The film takes a 360-degree look at the system, examining the problem through the eyes of families, social workers, judges, police, and prosecutors. The film challenges us to make the safety and welfare of children a national priority and prevent them from Slipping through the Cracks.
