Romantic Vision

 Romantic Vision is a short and intimate documentary portrait of British painter Hugo Grenville. Based on a series of interviews, observational film making and abstract photography, we see him at work in his East London studio and hear about the joys and frustrations of life as a painter. The film aims to capture the mood, sensuality and beauty of Hugo's studio, which in contrast to the world outside, has a dreamlike, meditative and romantic feel.
