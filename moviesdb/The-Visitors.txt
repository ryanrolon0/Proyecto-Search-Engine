The Visitors

 Having recently finished their first year of college apart, a group of seven tightly knit friends reunite to embark on a twenty-mile hike in the wilderness. Discovering they have strayed from their path and have no hope of finding their way home, they follow a mysterious stranger into a small, disconnected town where the population seems void of any type of modern technology, including phones. When welcomed to rest and spend the night the group does just that, but to their surprise their stay is expected to be much longer than a single evening. As the sun settles behind the horizon the trap is set and the chase is on. The small team of friend's struggle to keep one-another alive, as they try to escape the forgotten town and its murderous inhabitants.
