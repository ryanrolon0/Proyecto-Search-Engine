Prairie Rustlers

 Billy Carson is accused of the crimes comitted by his dead-ringer, outlaw cousin, Jim Slade, and barely escapes a lynching. With the aid of his pal, Fuzzy Jones, Billy catches up with his cousin and clears his own name. Having been sent to prison by his look-alike cousin Billy Carson, Jim is back as the head of a gang of outlaws. When his man Matt gets the job of bossing Foster's trail drive, he goes after the herd. When Billy interferes, he has him captured and dressed in Billy's clothes, he wounds Foster and lets Foster's daughter Helen see him. Then he has Matt ride into town with Billy as his prisoner and Helen is there to identify him.
