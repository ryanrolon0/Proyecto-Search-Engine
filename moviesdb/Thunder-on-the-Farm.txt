Thunder on the Farm

 For 150 years the old brick farmhouse spent the days watching the changing of the seasons, and the passing of the years. After 150 years, the summers pass now as if in just one day. The season's backdrop is the setting for life's natural drama. The baby birds grow and abandon the nest, the fruit ripens, and the leaves change and eventually fall from the tree. All the while, new houses are being built on the old farmland. They are large, fancy, and expensive. But will these new homes be standing in 150 years?
