The Soldier's Story

 This story of a fictional north Vietnamese and American soldier as they went through the Vietnam war is told from the point of view of each soldier, using documentary footage and scripted segments. Striking historical footage from both sides is a highlight of the film, while the intermixing of the soldiers' penned accounts adds a personal note. Less interest is shown in a chronology of the war as a whole, and more in the views of the two soldiers and their respective countries.
