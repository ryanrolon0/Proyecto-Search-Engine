The Hustlers

 Drifter Adams is out of traveling money - with only a little "drinking money" left - and stops off at a pool hall to raise some cash. He bets what little he has and wins, and gradually elevates himself into a higher stakes game with the local pool shark, L.A. Money. Cheering Adams on is new love interest Savannah. But when the big game arrives, and L.A. Money puts more cash on the table than Adams can cover, the drifter offers his new love up as a wager.
