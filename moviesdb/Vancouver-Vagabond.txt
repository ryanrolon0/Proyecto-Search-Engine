Vancouver Vagabond

 Vancouver Vagabond, a wacky and darkly candid autobiographical feature premiere and the 1st of a docudrama film trilogy from creator Heath Tait, explores his precarious journey through the 90's as a Gen-X indie artist & animator in and around Hollywood North, the city's politics and it's multi-color character. With the approach of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, the Vagabond series reveal a dramatic slice of both the city's and Canada's back story, historic and contemporary, informative and provocatively entertaining. Heath's personal story is seated firmly within a landscape of postmodern times, archival footage from five sources detailing Canadian and American times past.
