Pom, le poulain

 In the forest, Mirabelle, the mare, is the proud mother of Pom and is the best horse of the team. Made wrongly responsible for an accident which wounded the boss' son, she's sold and separated from her foal. Julien, the old groom, would like to help the young horse, but Pom is too desperate. Mirabelle will do everything possible to find and bring back her foal.
