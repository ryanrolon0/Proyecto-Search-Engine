The Doom of the Orb Master

 Where the good is ever changing regardless of gender, race or age, but the evil is constant, manipulative and egoistical, a curse is held over the evil by the victory of the Champion of Light. The evil tries to gain power through the evil deeds of the human beings using a cat as his accomplice, to challenge the good once more.
