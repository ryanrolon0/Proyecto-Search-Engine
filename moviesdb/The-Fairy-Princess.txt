The Fairy Princess

 A dark Halloween night in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Trick or treaters out with their parents. A little girl dressed as a fairy making the rounds alone. Seeing his opportunity, a neighbor snatches the girl, takes her into his basement where their game of cat and mouse begins... and ends.
