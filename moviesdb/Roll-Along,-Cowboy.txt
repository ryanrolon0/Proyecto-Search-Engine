Roll Along, Cowboy

 Morgan pays off Randy and Barry with a promissory note to be collected at the Blake ranch. They arrive to find Mrs. Blake sick and without any money, her back taxes due, her ranch hands departed, and her son in need of an operation. With Randy attracted to Janet and Barry hoping to help Danny, the two decide to stay.
