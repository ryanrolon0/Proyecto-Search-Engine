The Wog Boy

 Steve liked Celia from the moment they met. But following a clash with her boss, Raelene Beagle-Thorpe, Minister for employment, he finids himself on national television branded as Australia's biggest dole bludger. Now Steve has to prove to Celia, to himself, and to the whole country, that there's more to him than meets the eye. With a little help from his friends, he might just do it. As long as he can keep his best friend Frank away for Annie, Celia's little sister... and protect Frank's cousin Dom, from Tony, the insane local crime lord to whom Dom owes money... and prevent Theo, and enterprising neighbour, from throwing himself in front of a car to collect insurance. Mate there's just got to be an easier way to meet chicks.
