Something in Common

 This short story examines the darker side of the human mind and what logic could dictate in the path of temptation and greed. A vast fortune has been bequeathed to a small group of individuals who are all to inherit an equal share. But what if only one person survives to take it all? What if they all want to be that person? Could the power of greed make murder a normal part of their everyday existence? This fast moving murder mystery builds to a crescendo of tension by taking a closer view of the inner, darker side of the human mind. What are we capable of and why? Could this side of human nature exist in every one of us. Could we do it? Can they?
