The Stolen Engine

 A pair of crooks steal a valuable package, hold up the crew of a freight engine, and compel the engineer to aid their escape. Learning this, Helen climbs into the cab of a locomotive standing on a siding and takes up the chase. Traveling on a parallel track, Helen leaps into the stolen engine, overtakes the robbers, and recovers the package. At the final fadeout, Helen once again refuses a proposal of marriage, anticipating further hazards in the weeks to come.
