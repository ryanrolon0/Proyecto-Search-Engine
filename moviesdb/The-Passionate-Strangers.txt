The Passionate Strangers

 An angry husband (Michael Parsons) accidentally kills an old man while trying to find out where his wife (Valora Noland) and her Philippino lover are meeting. Because the old man had been trying to improve labor conditions for Philippino field workers, it is thought that the unsolved murder was politically motivated. This sparks labor riots.
