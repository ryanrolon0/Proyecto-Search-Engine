Roti Kee Keemat

 This is the story of Shankur, a kind generous man who's path in life is to help those who are less fortunate and need food. His own mother died after giving blood to get food for them and Shankur made it his life plan to help those in the same situation he was in with his mother. Befriending an orphan girl, Shanker and Bijlee set up a place where children can go for food and shelter, until one day their happiness is shattered by the evil Jagavar Chaudhry. Will Shankur ever fulfill his dreams of ridding his town of child hunger? After a couple are killed, the Chief Commissioner assigns this investigation to Poona-based Inspector R.K. Mathur, who lives with his wife, Sharda, and son, Shankar. Subsequently he arrests Sangha, and despite of his family's abduction by Sangha's brother, Jagawar, ensures that the former gets a life sentence in prison. Subsequently, he learns that both Sharda and Shankar have been burned alive. 20 years later Jagawar is known as J.K.; A vengeful Sangha is about to be released; Shankar, who survived the fire, lives a dual life - as the chief mentor of Sharda Anarthalay, and a bandit/burglar; and Mathur will be the Commissioner of Police - who will soon be suspended and accused of torturing and killing a male named D'Souza.
