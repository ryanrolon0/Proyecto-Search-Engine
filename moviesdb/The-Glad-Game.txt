The Glad Game

 The story of Joshua Rollins, a failed engineer hiding from life, and Trevor Mantle, his childhood best friend and successful real estate developer who hires a woman to pose as an object for Josh to desire. However, instead of enticing Josh back into reality, Eliza becomes the center of his obsessive dream-world and pushes him to uncover inner demons that have lain dormant up until now. Are his fantasies the makings of a murderous mind or pawns in a deadly game of manipulation?
