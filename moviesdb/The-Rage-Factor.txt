The Rage Factor

 There's a tradition in the UK since the 70s for an annual music event, the 'Christmas No.1' chart single. It's the highest selling music single on Christmas Day each year where numerous artists and the music industry alike aim for this accolade. Bets are taken, songs are recorded especially, and thousands tune in to the countdown on national radio to find out who has it. Since 2005 it has been dominated by reality TV show 'The X Factor' and this tradition started to disappear. In November 2009, Rage Against The Machine fans Jon and Tracy Morter had decided that enough was enough. A social networking campaign was started to get an alternative No.1 instead. It attracted over a million followers Worldwide plus attention from the media. The campaign was a success, with Rage Against The Machine selling over half a million downloads to be crowned the 2009 UK Christmas No.1... The band had pledged to play a free concert should they get to the top, and in June 2010 Rage Against The Machine travelled to London for this historical gig
