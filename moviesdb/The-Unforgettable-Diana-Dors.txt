The Unforgettable Diana Dors

 Short documentary profiling the life of British 'Blonde Bombshell' Diana Dors, who died of cancer in 1984. Movie clips and TV footage is mixed with celebrity interviews, including rare appearances by actor Rod Steiger and veteran director J. Lee Thompson. There is some interesting location work at Dors' lavish Sunningdale mansion and plenty of long-unseen film clips, but the documentary ultimately glosses over her scandalous, and often seedy, life.
