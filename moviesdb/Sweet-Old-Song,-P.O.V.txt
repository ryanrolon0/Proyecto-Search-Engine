Sweet Old Song, P.O.V

 National treasure Howard "Louie Bluie" Armstrong has been performing for most of his 91 years, ever since his father carved his first fiddle from a wooden crate. For two decades he has shared a life of creativity and feisty humor with artist Barbara Ward. Together they undertake a bittersweet journey to rediscover the past, and their place in it.
