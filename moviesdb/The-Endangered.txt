The Endangered

 Patrick Lumford (White) secretly dates Valerie Gray (African American). He keeps the romance a secret because of the ultra-conservative views of his father. One fateful afternoon, Patrick's sister, Courtney, walks home and is accosted in the woods. Courtney then goes missing. Valerie's brother, Eldridge, is then accused of the crime. The respective families' challenging beliefs then come to the fore as both fathers' views on race may prove not to be so different after all.
