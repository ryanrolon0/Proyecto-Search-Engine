Two Gun Sheriff

 As the Sundown Kid is being brought in for murder, Albo's men attack the stage and free him. Albo wants him due to his resemblance to the Sheriff. Next he has the Sheriff captured and replaced with the Kid. Albo's scheme works fine as the Kid OK's the sale of Albo's rustled cattle. But there is trouble when the Kid's girlfriend arrives to expose the hoax.
