To Dance for a Vampire

 A vampire, Francis, is holding on to his feelings for his late mortal love, Bathory, who died in the 1800's. This time he has found her soul inside a wild exotic dancer, Beth. Francis lures her back to his home and ends up infecting her by his bite. Beth does not want to stay and become a vampire. Francis does not want to see his love go down a self destructing path.
