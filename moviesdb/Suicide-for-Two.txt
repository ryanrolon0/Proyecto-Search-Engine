Suicide for Two

 Corben, a mortuary employee, is put in an awkward situation when Steve comes in to plan a funeral for his own suicide. Corben feels conflicted, but, after all, the customer is always right. Corben's boss, Jack, a used car salesman of a funeral director, couldn't agree more, telling Corben that 'dead's dead' and they need the business. Jack only becomes concerned when he learns Corben accepted a check. Worried a suicidal customer might not care about bouncing a check, Jack sends Corben to collect cash for the service. Corben arrives at Steve's house and finds him ready to do it. Will Corben talk him out of it, get the money, or just get out?
