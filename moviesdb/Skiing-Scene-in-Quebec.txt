Skiing Scene in Quebec

 A wonderful and perfect picture of this great Winter sport in Canada. A number of skiers are going down hill at a terrific speed. They jump a hurdle of snow on their way to the foot of the incline. Nearly all of the jumpers fall to the ground in a heap after taking the hurdle.
