The Americans Are Coming, the Americans Are Coming!

 From the USA, to Spain, France and Italy, THE AMERICANS ARE COMING represents a hilarious look at the power of Hollywood told through the eyes of some truly unique and broke individuals. A 2004 international road-trip film about five American slackers who attempt to con their way through Europe on a first class vacation by pretending to shoot a documentary film. A journey never before traveled, 'Americans' will take you from the wildest parties on the Riviera to the most life threatening moments with the Italian mafia.
