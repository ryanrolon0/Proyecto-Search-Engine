The Day I Thought I Died

 A 10 minute personal narrative about the possible meaning of ones own death. Set against the backdrop of the beautiful song 18 by Moby, and using a combination of home-movie footage and dramatic re-creation, the short film explores the greater meaning of our lives, and the impact that the loss of that life has on both ourselves and those around us.
