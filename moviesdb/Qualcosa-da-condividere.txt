Qualcosa da condividere

 Leonardo has just moved in a small town where he works as a DJ for a radio. He has an affair with Matilde, a married woman, with a special passion for chatting on the Web with young guys. In his free time he films people secretly to find inspiration for his novels. One day he films Greta, a young musician and they start communicating with a voice recorder. She'll teach him the value of sharing ideas and experiences, but he has to face his nature of traveler and his desire of freedom. In the background a wave of young demonstrators claims their right to active participation in society.
