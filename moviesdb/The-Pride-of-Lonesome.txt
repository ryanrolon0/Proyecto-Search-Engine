The Pride of Lonesome

 The cheery smile of big-hearted Ed Daton, a simple Westerner, causes a little girl to sense the thrill of happiness. Her desire for a greater measure of this, to her unknown joy, prompts her to steal away from her abusive parents and wander back to the little station known as "Lonesome." She is taken in by big Ed and the other noble herdsman and develops under the new environment to a bright and cheerful maiden. Out of gratitude, she guards the welfare of her benefactors and prompts them to nobler deeds of manhood. Her activity in behalf of her friends causes her to arouse the animosity of the keeper of the one grog shop "Lonesome" boasted of and with the decrease in business he conspires against "Pride," as she becomes known to the people. The plots against her were duly foiled and one would have been disastrous to the perpetrators but for the timely arrival of "Pride," who prevents their untimely demise on the promise never to attempt further molestations.
