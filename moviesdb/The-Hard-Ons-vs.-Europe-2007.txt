The Hard-Ons vs. Europe 2007

 Since more than 25 years The Hard-Ons from Sidney demonstrate their interpretation of Rock'n'Roll to audiences all around the globe. Their discography and live-performances show, that the love of these guys for music & artistic freedom is essential in their lives. The European tour 2007 of this Australian idealistic band with such a huge range of music-styles and a long history is the base for a road-movie including different locations, interviews, crowds, impressions ... and of course lots of music in several countries. 'In an unagitated way the pictures tell us from the typical tour life, the interviews present us likeable Aussies who remained true to their strictly independent love for music.' (Peter Kaiser, Slam no. 42, March-April 2009)
