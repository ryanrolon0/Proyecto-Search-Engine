The Tougher They Come

 Lumberjack Joe MacKinley inherits a valuable tract of forest-land which is coveted by a large lumber company. He and his new bride, Kay, start a logging operation but quickly run into trouble because of a series of sabotage-events, staged to look like accidents by their foreman, Williams, who is working for the lumber-combine. Joe is nearly broke and about to sell out cheaply when an old friend, Bill Shaw, comes to his rescue as a partner. To force the partners to sell, William starts a forest fire.
