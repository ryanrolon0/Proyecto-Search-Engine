Takhti

 Ali Hatami's film on the life of Iranian wrestling champion Takhti remains unfinished. Another director is assigned by the I.R. Intelligence Ministry to finish the project. The new director wants to carry out research on the life of the champion, and it would seem that he will have to solve numerous problems before he can finish the job.
