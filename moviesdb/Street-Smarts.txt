Street Smarts

 The year is 1995 and the New York streets are buzzing with the daily struggles of people just trying to get by. Mr. William Grier, an Ex-drug dealer, has landed a job as a substitute teacher at his neighborhood high school. The first introduction to his new class is like that of any other new teacher. The students take him as another college-fed, boring substitute teacher. The student's bad manners and unwillingness to learn transforms Mr. Grier back into the hardcore businessman he has struggled to leave behind. With a dash of street knowledge, a touch of relatable dialogue and a bit of trust, William Grier is able to break the wall that stands between him and his class.
