The Russian Army in Manchuria

 A grand and unique series of pictures photographed by Mr. George Rogers. Mr. George Rogers, the war correspondent of the Charles Urban Trading Co. is an American. He has made his application from Paris. Here he waited three months before a permit to go to Russia was granted. After waiting three weeks in St. Petersburg, he was allowed to proceed as far as Irkutsk. At this town, he was turned out of the train, on the ground that transport was needed for the military for war stores. So Mr. Rogers bought a sledge and three ponies, and fortunately falling in with a troop of cossacks arrived, after seventeen days travelling, at Harbin where he was by the end of April. Order of the scenes by Generals Rennankamph and Grekoff. -- II. Troop of cossacks starting the march across Lake Baikal. -- III. Russian infantry crossing Lake Baikal. -- IV. Transport of Army provisions across Lake Baikal. -- V. Cossacks on the march to the Yalu waited three weeks in St. Petersburg.
