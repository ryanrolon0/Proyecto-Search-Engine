The Nuremberg Trial

 In 1945, an international court of judges from the U.S., England, France and the Soviet Union tried 22 top Nazi leaders, including Hermann Goering and Rudolph Hess. The defendants were charged with conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Twelve defendants were sentenced to death, seven received prison terms and three were acquitted.
