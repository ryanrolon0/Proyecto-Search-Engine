Skeet Shooting

 Dexter is depressed and has become a hermit since his girlfriend left him. In a last-ditch effort to shake him out of his funk, his friends come over bearing pizza and comic books. When their offerings do not bring him mirth, Jacob recommends that Dexter engage in a little self-love. This turns the conversation down a path of hilarious recounting of various romantic mishaps from the assembled friends.
