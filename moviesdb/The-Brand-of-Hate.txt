The Brand of Hate

 The Camp and Larkin families are neighboring ranchers and young Rod Camp ('Bob Steele (I)' (qv), is in love with Joe Larkin's ('William Farnum' (qv))daughter, Margie ('Lucile Browne' (qv).) But, from out of nowhere, Joe's outlaw brother, Bill Larkins ('George 'Gabby' Hayes' (qv)) and his two worthless sons, Holt ('James Flavin' (qv)), and "Slim" ('Archie Ricks' (qv), and move in with the peaceful and law-abiding branch of the family. In addition to rustling cattle from the neighboring ranchers, Hold and "Slim" decide they have kissing-rights to cousin Margie, and this leads to Rod having a fight with them at a barn-dance. When his father ('Charles K. French' (qv) catches the renegade Larkins rustling and changing brands on his cattle, he is shot. Rod sets out to prove they are the culprits. Trouble starts when Bill Larkins and his two sons move in with his brother Joe. They start rustling cattle and then kill Rod's father with Joe's gun. The Sheriff and Rod think they did it and are after proof.
