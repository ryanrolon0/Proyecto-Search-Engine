Silly Night

 This FICTIONAL short begins with a few sight-gags done around watching Jefferson Machamer, syndicated newspaper cartoonist on such strips as "Hollywood Husband" and "Gags and Gals", doing a few sketches of some decorative models (for his "Gags and Gals" comic strip), and some dancing by Ruth Clayton, and the dance-team of Stanley & Elaine, are tossed in the mix. The mix includes a plot that has the fictional Machamer (played by the real Machamer)getting tossed into jail for eating too fast in his home-made sidewalk cafE.
