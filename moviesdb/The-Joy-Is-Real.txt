The Joy Is Real

 A remarkable music theater group for intellectually disabled people and their support workers rehearse and perform their latest production, a spaghetti western called "The Nine Lives of Rocky Racoon". We hear from Corey, a young aboriginal man whose vision has inspired those around him, and meet Ollie, the charismatic theater director with a special love of song and a talent for bringing out the strengths of the group. We share the space she holds for these enthusiastic performers and their willing support workers en route to their big day.
