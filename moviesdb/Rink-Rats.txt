Rink Rats

 In 1977 three investors opened a street hockey rink in Western Berks County, PA. The rink operated for thirty years and had a major influence on thousands of people's lives. The rink closed in 2005. Former players, owners, managers, and referees all weigh in on just how important the rink was to them. Old photos and video throughout provide a look back to a time held sacred by a great many people.
