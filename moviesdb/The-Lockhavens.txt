The Lockhavens

 Senzo Lockhaven is an outcast from his world due to his fascination with mortals. Although he grew up in a castle atop Mt. Lockhaven and comes from a long line of "upper class" sorcerers, normal human beings intrigue him. Other witches and warlocks frown upon this behavior. Senzo secretly dates and falls in love with a mortal grade school teacher, Sandra L. Springfield. She's intelligent, gentle, sweet, and eager to learn about Senzo. Yet she has no idea that witches and warlocks really exist. Senzo asks for her hand in marriage, and she agrees not knowing that he is a warlock. He is forced to eventually confess his secret to Sandy at the risk of losing his magic if she decides to leave him. She accepts his proposal and their journey together begins. Here comes the in-laws. . . Overall, "THE LOCKHAVENS" illustrates that as a society, we should accept each others differences because looks can be deceiving. It should be noted that the central couple is considered 'mixed', being Warlock and Mortal although they are seemingly the same race. This further demonstrates that, as a human race, we all really have the same problems when it comes down to it.
