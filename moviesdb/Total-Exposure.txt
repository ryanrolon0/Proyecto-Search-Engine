Total Exposure

 When the ambitious photographer Andi returns from a modeling session in Mexico, she finds a kilogram cocaine in her bag. In panic - and thinking of her prior convictions - she immediately dumps it in the sink. She suspects her star model Cathy and calls her to account for it, but she denies everything. When Cathy's found dead shortly after, Andi is under suspect. She employs ex-cop Dave Murphy to help her out and to protect her from the psychopathic dealer, who wants back his cocaine from her.
