 As a young lad, Jeet is traumatized by the brutal killing of his dad allegedly at the hands of his paternal uncle, Shyamlal. Although the latter is arrested, found guilty, and serving time in prison, an embittered Jeet, now fully matured and alcoholic, awaits his discharge so that he can kill him and thus avenge his father's death.
