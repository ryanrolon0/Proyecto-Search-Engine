Sone Ki Chidiya

 Lakshmi is a poor girl with a large family to support. She strikes it big time when she gets a chance to star in a film. She falls in love with her flamboyant co-star, Amar. Disillusionment faces her when she learns that he, too is only interested in her wealth. She runs away and tries to commit suicide when she is stopped by a poor writer, Shrikant, who befriends her. It is then that she realizes that not everyone in the world is interested in her purely for her money.
