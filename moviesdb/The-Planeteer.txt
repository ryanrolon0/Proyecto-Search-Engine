The Planeteer

 Like Ferdinand Magellan, eleven-year-old Bradley Maguire, an imaginative backyard astronomer, has dreams to set sail...around the solar system. So, in preparation for his future endeavors, Bradley's built an accurate and detailed model of the solar system with hopes of taking home a first place ribbon at the school science fair. To Bradley's surprise, no one shows any interest in Bradley's model except for visiting former astronaut, Commander Perry Scott, and when NASA loses contact with the crew on a Mars-bound mission, Bradley's solar system model may help the world's leading scientists unravel the cosmic mystery. Join Bradley on an adventure across the galaxy in this small, but epic tale.
