Rich Men's Sons

 Idler rich-boy Arnold Treadway is the son of the president of a big railroad company who is forced by his disapproving father to go out and earn his own living. He goes to work for the owner, John Gordon, of a small iron works, whose business his father is trying to buy, and falls in love with Gordon's daughter, Carla. When Mr. Gordon falls ill, Carla takes over the operation aided by Arnold. The latter soon finds himself in a conflict situation in opposition of his father.
