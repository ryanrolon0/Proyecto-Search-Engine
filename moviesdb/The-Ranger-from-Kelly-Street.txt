The Ranger from Kelly Street

 As a Private in Company D, 1st Ranger Battalion, Harry Perlmutter was captured during the annihilation of the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions at the Battle of Cisterna, shortly after the Anzio landings in Italy, 1944. Of the approximately 700 Rangers who took part in this mission, only three walked out of the ambush alive. The rest were either killed or captured. Harry details his capture, escape, and the three months he spent with Italian partisans evading the German army.
