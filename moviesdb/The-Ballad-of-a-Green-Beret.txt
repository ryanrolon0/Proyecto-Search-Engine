The Ballad of a Green Beret

 Bo Gritz should be an all American Hero. The most decorated Green Beret from the Vietnam era, he served his country with loyalty and valour, killing over 400 men in the process and gaining national fame through his exploits. Today, he lives in a trailer in Sandy Valley Nevada, discredited, unable to sleep at night and estranged from his children. What went wrong? This film follows Bo on his last mission, a mission to save a young boys life, a mission to uncover some meaning from his life, a mission to stop the nightmares.
