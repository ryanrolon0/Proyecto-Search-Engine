Post-Partum

 When I was two months old my mother abandoned me, leaving me in my grandmother's care. She could no longer bear the sound of my incessant crying. So many tears drive me to the water's edge. Towards water that I have always been so afraid of. In a thought, in a moment, I revisited my past, I revisited hers.
