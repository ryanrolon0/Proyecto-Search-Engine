Universal Variety Views, No. 93

 This entry of "Universal Variety Views" has narrator Graham McNamee narrating while movie chimpanzee Jimmy the Chimp shows he can operate a service station as good as the next man. Jimmy pumps gas into the car from the pump with gas priced at fourteen cents a gallon, and taxed at four cents a gallon, and then does an oil-change on the Studebaker on the grease-rack lift. Just to show he is not a one-trick-pony...uh...chimp...Jimmy displays his carpentering skills with a saw, hammer,nails, brace-and-bit auger, takes time out to strike a match and light his cigar---hey, it's his gas station, he can do what he wants---and then opens his beer bottle with a bottle-cap opener and takes a swig. Meanwhile, Mrs. Jimmy is threading a needle and doing some darning while rocking away in a rocking chair. The plot is a bit thin, but the editing is great.
