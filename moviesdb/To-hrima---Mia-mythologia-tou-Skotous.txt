To hrima - Mia mythologia tou Skotous

 The process of a resurrected Christ for bringing to an end the social nightmare and establishing a poetic paradise through purgatories and hells of Myth and History. With "Money" we are able to trace the root of civilization's downfall, motivating Christ's final speech, delivered at the stock exchange. Within this spectacular setting of modern history, the symbol of a forgotten world challenges directly Paternal authority and power, from which springs all that is tragic in the cosmic game. His ultimate death is indicative of the death of civilization itself, from which humanity can expect absolutely nothing anymore, aside from living out the guilt for the lost paradise.
