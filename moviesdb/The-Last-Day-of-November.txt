The Last Day of November

 A family of hunters has shot a deer. They proceed to gut it and then transport it back to the barn, where other family members (including young cousins, siblings and offspring) are socializing. The grandfather of the family then washes his hands in the lake and transports the deer to the local meat processing facility for cleaning, aging and butchering.
