Riding the Sunset Trail

 Jay Lynch, the half-brother of rancher Jim Dawson, schemes with Dawson's crooked lawyer, Jasper Raines, to take over Dawson's ranch. Lynch has his henchmen, "Bronco" West and "Drifter" Smith kill Dawson, but Dawson is only wounded and found and hidden away by cattle-association detectives Tom Sterling and his sidekick, Lopez Mendoza. Lynch then shows up at the Dawson ranch with a forged will, leaving him the ranch, with intent to evict Dawson's daughters, Betty and Sugar, but Sterling and Mendoza intervene. Lynch then hires gunman "Pecos" Dean to ambush and kill Sterling but Dean turns out to be a crook that has reformed. Sterling, aided by Judge Little and Sheriff Hays and the return of the supposedly-dead man, puts an end to Lynch's plan. Jay Lynch, the head of an outlaw gang, instructs his henchmen, "Bronco" West and 'Drifter" Smith, to kill Lynch's half-brother, Jim Dawson. He intends, with the help of Dawson's crooked lawyer, Jasper Raines, to forge a will leaving him Dawson's ranch and then evict the rightful heirs, Betty and Sugar Dawson, the owner's two daughters. They are about to comply when Tom Sterling and Lopez Mendoza offer their help. Dawson was only wounded and found by Sterling and Mendoza and hidden away. With the aid of Judge Little and Sheriff Hays, the two undercover men foil Lynch's scheme.
