The 8th Street Bridge

 They thought it was just a bridge. However the local government didn't realize it was much more than that. It was memories and childhoods and everything held sacred by a small, sleepy coastal California town since 1950. And if they were going to tear it down, they were in store for a fight. This 18 minute documentary is about a small town of 14,000 and their fight against City Hall over preserving or destroying a historical walking bridge in Carpinteria, California. It's a story about power vs tradition, politics vs community. As more and more small towns across America become faceless, generic rest stops, one small town tried to hold on to its identity and its memories.
