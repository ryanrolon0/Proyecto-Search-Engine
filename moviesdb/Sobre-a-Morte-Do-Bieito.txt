Sobre a Morte Do Bieito

 What would you do if you were in a funeral and you felt something moving inside the coffin? a) I would tell it to the others and open the coffin quickly. We must save him! b) I would not say anything. Seeing is believing ... and I'm not opening it to find out! c) I would yell and run away.
