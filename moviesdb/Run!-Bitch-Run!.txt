Run! Bitch Run!

 Catherine and Rebecca are two Catholic School girls going door-to-door selling Religious paraphernalia in order to pay for their books and education. Things go horribly wrong when they knock on the wrong door in the wrong neighborhood. "Run! Bitch Run!" is a throw back to the classic rape and revenge films like _The Last House on the Left (1972)_ (qv) and _Ms. 45 (1981)_ (qv).
