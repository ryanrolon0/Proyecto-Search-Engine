Sport Slants

 This sport short showcases greyhound racing and diving. At a dog racing track we first see the prerace activities, including examination by officials and the post parade. After the race we go to a large pool for a diving exhibition. Divers include the 1928 men's Olympic champion and two divers who specialize in very high dives (94 feet and 134 feet) off a small platform.
