Uranium Blues

 An old prospector and his faithful mule have shared the dangers of gold-seeking together for many years until the hunt for uranium becomes a quest. The old prospector switches to a jeep and leaves his faithful mule behind. However, the jeep is not as dependable as the mule and fails the prospector in a crisis situation, and the mule goes to his rescue.
