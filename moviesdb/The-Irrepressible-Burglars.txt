The Irrepressible Burglars

 A scene in which the trials and mishaps of the burglar's life are depicted in a most humorous manner. Several burglars of the comic order are seen indulging in some very lively housebreaking. Three policemen are hot on the track of the burglars, who elude the officers at every point, escaping through windows and doors and climbing up ladders, planks, poles, etc. They execute some wonderful flying leaps, jumping across from one side of the street to the other, and think nothing of jumping up to a second-story window to escape the policemen. One of the burglars is very fat, and his efforts to escape are very comical. He finally slides down a slanting plank. Although the film is of the comic order, some very clever acrobatic work is shown. The subject is full of laughs from beginning to end.
