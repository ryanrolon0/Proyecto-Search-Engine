The Adventure Scouts

 Scouts Honor is a coming of age movie about a group of boys and girls called "adventure scouts" who return from a camping trip to discover their small town is being held captive by a gang of motorcycle-riding knuckleheads. Using only their scouting knowledge and camping equipment, the kids take down the gang members one by one, reunite with family members, and restore the community's sense of pride.
