The Western Doctor's Peril

 Doctor Arthur Kenwood receives an urgent call to a distant ranch. His way lies past the depot, and he passes shortly after a lone bandit has held up the agent and shot him. Charley Going, the brother of the agent, arrives on the scene in time to see his brother breathe his last and the doctor riding rapidly away from the town. He hurries to where the boys are loitering, with the announcement that Dr. Kenwood has shot his brother and has gotten away with the express company's money. A posse is formed, and they ride out in pursuit of the doctor. The fleeing bandit drops one of the money sacks, and the doctor finds it. He stops at the watering trough to refresh his horse, and is overtaken by the posse. Instead of his usually orderly deputies, the sheriff finds that the sight of the doctor infuriates them to a point where they desire to lynch his prisoner, and he has hard work to protect the doctor, and lodge him in jail. Charley Going frets at the law's delay in meting out justice. The sheriff is wily and guards his prisoner closely, for he fears the boys will take the law into their own hands at the first opportunity. Going hits upon a scheme to decoy the sheriff away from town, and kissing his little daughter, he goes to the boys to unfold his plan to them.
