Rebel Without a Condom

 Waitress Peggy Jo is a woman with 1990's ideas, trapped in 1950's middle America. She is young and rebellious, a female version of James Dean. And Peggy Jo has her eyes for Steve Decker, a "bad boy" loner in a leather jacket who rides a motorcycle and works as a car mechanic. Looking down her pretty nose at Peggy Jo is Sandra White, pampered and popular, and her friend, Anita, the daughter of a clergy men. But in this Anytown USA, it may turn out that the "good girls" are the ones who truly like it bad.
