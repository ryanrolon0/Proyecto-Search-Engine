The Annotated Alice

 In this intimate documentary portrait, Alice Shalvi shares her thoughts and memories of her public and private life, from her childhood in Essen to her present-day success as a leading Israeli scholar, feminist, and peace activist. Shalvi tells the story of her personal odyssey as a daughter, wife, mother of six, university professor, principal of an experimental girls' religious school, and founding chairwoman of the Israel Women's Network. The film ends as she begins her present job as Rector of the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. Paula Weiman-Kelman's film is a richly textured tribute weaving together home movies, archival footage, and Shalvi's splendidly-told tales.
