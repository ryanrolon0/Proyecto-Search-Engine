The Old Prospector

 Directed and written (adapted from a poem by Bruce Kiskadden) by actress Rita La Roy, whose husband Ben Hirschield produced, this is the first of a series of outdoor shorts shot in Cinemachrome process. The story, as narrated by Cy Kendall, tells of an old prospector (Si Jenks), who never made a strike, and his mule revisiting the old ghost towns from their prospecting past.
