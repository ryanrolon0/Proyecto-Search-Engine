The Final Journey

 The Final Journey follows the rail lines of the Nazi Controled Deutsche Reichsbahn system that delivered millions of people from every corner of Europe to the door-step of the infamous Concentration Camps. By integrating a special collection of rare photographs and crystal clear archival film, the viewer is taken on a then and now journey to each of the former Nazi camps of Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Buchenwld, Flossenbuerg, Mauthausen, Ravensbrueck, Neuengamme, Stutthof and Bergen-Belsen where millions suffered and died.
