Uso and Sole

 Uso and Sole are Aotearoas finest "freshy's" who are inspired by a Dance Party Flyer they anonymously have.Uso and Sole have planned to look for the party they believe is the Dream Party of all time. A fun romp and story of two friendships; "the boys' and 'the idiots', who have two things in mind; party-party-party and girls-girls-girls.
