The Tramp Trapped

 "Two young ladies are sitting on a rustic seat in front of a cottage, and a tramp comes along and proceeds to make himself obnoxious. The young ladies run into the house, and the tramp impudently puts his head into the window to see where they are gone. As he does so, the sash is slammed down on his neck, holding him a prisoner."
