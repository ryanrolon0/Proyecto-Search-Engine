Rainscape

 Rainscape is a celebration of a glorious English summer, of escaping from reality. This is the story of Amanda's camping trip that's anything but dry. She showers under a waterfall, tries to catch fish, gets caught in a torrential rainstorm and a saucy rabbit looks up her skirt! And finally, Amanda is ambushed by six super-soaker wielding girls ending in a very wet free for all and striptease. Rainscape is all outdoor action combining beautiful girls, spectacular landscape and supreme wetness.
