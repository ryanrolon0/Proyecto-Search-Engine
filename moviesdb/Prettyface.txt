Prettyface

 In the summer of 1969, Jenna, a rebellious sixteen-year old girl, abandoned by her deadbeat mom, steals a horse named Prettyface from her best friend's family and plans to ride across the United States. When Marlena, her naive and very square best friend follows her on her pony, what follows alters their lives forever.
