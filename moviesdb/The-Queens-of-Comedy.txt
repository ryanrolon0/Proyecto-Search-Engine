The Queens of Comedy

 Four African American women, profane and brassy, bring stand-up comedy to the Orpheum Theater in Memphis, Tennessee. Miss Laura Hayes opens the show and serves as emcee. She tells family stories about her grandkids, her mom, and her sisters. Adele Givens urges her audience to celebrate its flaws; she comments on this crazy world, her 92-year-old grandmother, and the need to take care when naming a baby. Sommore, recently released from jail, talks about kids, men, marriage, and why moms give their 8-year-old daughters a hula hoop. Last, Mo'Nique celebrates big women, contrasts Blacks and whites, and gives advice about sex. The film also cuts away to footage of the Queens on the town having fun.
