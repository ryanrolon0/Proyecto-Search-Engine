Two Million Stupid Women

 Melissa is not having a good night. On her 21st birthday, she's caught her boyfriend J.T. cheating on her with a bimbo that looks like a swizzle stick. As she drinks away her sorrows with her best friends Anna and Todd, she hits upon the idea to hunt down all of her previous hook ups and wipe the slate clean. Anna and Todd think this is a bad idea, but damned if they're gonna miss out on some potentially embarrassing drunken hijinks. Thus starts a journey that takes the three friends across the Los Angeles nightscape singers, nerds who can't hold their liquor, jerks, sluts, bad jokes, worse self esteem and mind games galore. It's a birthday for the books as Melissa navigates the tricky line between Closure and Crazy, scrambling to avoid becoming one of Two Million Stupid Women.
