Ulica grafita

 LaBanda was one of the most important bands of a Sarajevo alternative rock scene. In the late 80s LaBanda was working on their first album. Eleven songs were recorded. But the war spreads in Bosnia and album stays unfinished. 15 years later the members of LaBanda tracks each other (they live in 5 deferent countries) and decides to finish the work they started long time ago - to record the last two songs of the album. They meet each other for the first time after 15 years in Sarajevo, the place they were forced to leave many years ago.
