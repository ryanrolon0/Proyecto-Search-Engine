The Small Somewhere

 A modern day retelling of Don Quixote finds the titular character embodied by Richard Crane, a night-shift security guard at an orange packing plant. Richard wander the empty facility with little to do and is left to invent a world in which he is necessary. He seeks out crimes to solve and damsels to save - much to the chagrin of his shiftless co-worker Kumar. Richard falls for a local prostitute, who works the street outside the factory. Seeing her in distress Richard takes action and marries his imagined hero persona to real world action. Can Richard best the giant or will the windmill knock him off his horse?
