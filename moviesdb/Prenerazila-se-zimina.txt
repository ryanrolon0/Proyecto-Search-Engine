 Every second household in Serbian countryside keeps pigs. The majority of Serbian pigs lives and dies in cruel conditions; less than one third are slaughtered in slaughterhouses (more or less by EU regulations), and the other two thirds get slaughtered by the "slayers" ("professional slaughterers" also known as "pig's orthopedists") in village courtyards, livestock markets, at sides of roads, at fairs and carnivals. The implementation of the new Animal welfare and Food safety laws foretells radical change of lifestyle of Serbian pigs, but the new laws are triggering bitter reactions from the disillusioned Serbian peasants. Through the story of pig welfare, its breakthrough scientific, but also traditional aspects, we are observing the impoverished Serbian countryside, the absurd conditions in agriculture, and the inevitable transformation of Serbian society instigated by the desire for integration into European Union.
