Rock and Roll Mobster Girls

 In Seattle during the 1980s "grunge rock" phase, an all-female band called The Doll Squad is finding it increasingly difficult to get work, and they are soon reduced to scavenging food from dumpsters outside of restaurants. Frustrated with their stalled career, they decide to sign with a shady local promoter, Bruno Multrock in hopes that he will be able to get them the exposure they need. What they don't know is that Bruno is actually a psychotic murderer who enjoying butchering people and keeps his brother's decapitated head with him so he can talk to it.
