The Journeyman Project 3

 Gage Blackwood (Jerry Rector and the player) of the Temporal Security Agency must go back in time to the lost cities of Atlantis, El Dorado, and Shangri La to save the world from hostile aliens outside of the galactic protectorate, the Symbiotry. In the process, he discovers that the founders of the Symbiotry, along with the present day invaders, have played an integral role in the destruction of the three lost cities. In this game, your primary objective is to retrieve three pieces of the Sosequi Legacy from the lost cities. Along the way, you'll meet up with all kinds of people from the past including Genghis Khan. Matt Weinhold does an excellent job doing the voice for Arthur, Gage's hilarious A.I. sidekick.
