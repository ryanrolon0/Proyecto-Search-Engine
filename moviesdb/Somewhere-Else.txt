Somewhere Else

 Somewhere Else is a portrait of four young people between the ages of 19 and 27, all of whom are survivors of the war in Sarajevo. Sixty minutes of their impressions and conversations from a damaged city speculation in the face of their struggle to articulate their experiences? At the same time, Barbara Albert is forced to reflect upon her role as a "creator of images."
