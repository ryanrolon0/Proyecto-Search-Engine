The Promise

 Daniel and Andrea grew up in the same home and have been closer than real brothers and sisters ever since. But her father's goodwill to take in Daniel and bring him up does not sit well with her real older brother, who retaliates one day and kicks Daniel out. But by this time, nothing can come between the deeply in love Andrea and Daniel anymore--until the rich family on whose hacienda they've been working all these years come back. Andrea catches the eye of the rich son, while the daughter fancies Daniel, too. This will set in motion a series of events that will test how deep the two's love goes.
