Testing the Undertow

 'Testing the Undertow' is a personal examination of class, pride, and identity as it has played out on the landscape of Marin County, California from the 1980s to the present. Shot on 16mm and completed on digital video, the film presents a personal family history of financial struggles and triumphs during the '80s and '90s in juxtaposition with the county's current economic and cultural topography.
