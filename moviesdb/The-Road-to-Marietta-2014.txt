The Road to Marietta 2014

 Created by Ernest Everett Blevins, the Graves Register and Monuments officer of the Department of Georgia & South Carolina Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Ernest wanted to attract attention to the prospect of hosting the 2014 National Encampment in Georgia. He wanted this event to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the War between the States and the Atlanta Campaign. Using historical references to follow the road from north Georgia to the Atlanta area, the video shows historical and modern sites along the trail.
