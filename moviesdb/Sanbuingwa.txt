Sanbuingwa

 Through multiple story lines, amid graphic portrayals of actual births, caeseareans and a vasectomy, this satirical comedy-drama set in a women's clinic wages an all-out assault on contemporary Korean sexual and gender practices. Love and loss, life and death are all in a day's work for two women, an obstetrician Dr. Jung-Yeon Han and a gynecologist Dr. Hye-Suk Min. "Push! Push!" follows the two as they treat an ensemble of ordinary women enduring extraordinary circumstances in this astonishingly vivid human dramedy. A con-woman wants the results of her pregnancy test falsified. A woman in her late forties thinks she will be more desirable if she get a hymen reconstruction. A young teenage girl is first robbed of her innocence and then of her child. A women with romanticized notions of the "beautiful pain of mother nature" gets a dose of reality. "Push! Push!" presents these women and others in a straight-forward and thought-provoking look into the complexities of being a woman.
