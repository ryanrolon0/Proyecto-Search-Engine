Redwood Curtain

 Geri Riordan is adopted, half-Vietnamese, eighteen, and a piano prodigy. She also feels as if she doesn't know who she really is, and when her adopted father dies, she begins to search for her biological father. The trail leads into the redwood forest the Riordans have owned for generations, to a 'Nam vet who lives there. But he doesn't want to talk to her, and Geri must convince him to give her the answers she's looking for.
