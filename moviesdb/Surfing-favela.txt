Surfing favela

 "Surfing Favela" was shot with the aid of the communities of Cantagalo and Rocinha; the latter, with its 250,000 inhabitants, is considered the biggest slum (Favela) in Rio de Janeiro. The documentary richly portrays the daily tasks of a group of surfers that helps the youth of their own community to discover in surfing, a direct bridge to freedom and nature.
