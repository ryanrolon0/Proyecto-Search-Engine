 Stockflame is about the German Hessian legend of the knight of Rodenstein whose arch-enemy is Doc Wood, an evil doctor who kidnapped kids and boys from Odenwald, Germany since 1505 for hundreds of years. The doctor recruited the kidnapped boys to to conquer the world one day. The Rodensteiner together with his soldiers challenged Doc Wood but was killed by the evil doctor who continued to kidnap and recruit boys for many years. 500 years later, Matthew Stockflame, a descendant of a mystic boy with magical powers, is the only one who has the power to overcome the doctor.
