Sweet Clover

 A heartrending tale of one man's losses, Sweet Clover's soliloquy unfolds in fragments, revealing its tragic story through quiet portraits and moments of ephemera. Captured on 16mm (and bits of 8mm) by director Stephanie Lucas, the Polish-language short is largely inspired by Krzystof Kieslowski and early Wim Wenders. It stars real-life father and son Barry and Josh Kasselman, as well as 5-year-old Luke Karel.
