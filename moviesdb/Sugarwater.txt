Sugarwater

 Jim, a twentysomething shut-in, does the bare-minimum to survive - nothing more, nothing less. Hope, his best friend for years, is in love with Jim but not his lack of motivation. When Jim realizes his feelings for Hope, he faces the decision commitment and effort, or do nothing and risk losing Hope forever.
