The Filchaks Take a Gamble

 - "Frank, you're thinking like a gambler! Sports wagering is more like investing." - "Our system, our experience, guarantees you go at least seventy percent for a full season!" With statements like these, you'd think recovering alcoholic Leo Filchak and his two sons, Brian and Craig, are the worlds' most successful family of sports handicappers. They're not. In fact they stink. They've lost the last fourteen football picks they've given out and if a client's not crying, he's threatening litigation. Now with their "empire" crumbling and younger brother Brian about to lose his house, this delightfully pathetic family decides to go "all in" and bet what little money they have on the annual Thanksgiving Day pro football game. It's a financial scheme only a "bust-out" could love. Shame they KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HANDICAPPING FOOTBALL! Can they pick a winner? Will Brian's wife go back to Odessa? Will Craig's psychotic girlfriend throw something again? What the hell is pilgrim vodka? Find out in the darkly twisted comedy- THE FILCHAKS TAKE A GAMBLE. .
