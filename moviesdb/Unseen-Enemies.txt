Unseen Enemies

 A valuable ranch lands in the hands of "Bingo" Strook when "Dad" Davenport dies and leaves two young boys. Strook is a dope smuggler and his accomplice is Laura, the Davenport housekeeper. "Happened-Along" Meredith and "Doughnut" Casey are on the property one day and Laura drives them away. They ride on laughing, and 'happen-along' in time to rescue Doris Davenport, niece of "Dad" who has come to taker over the ranch and care for the boys, when she falls off the motor-stage. Meredith borrows a couple of horse and a buckboard and takes Doris to the ranch. This does not set well with Strook. He sets a trap for Meredith, sends for the Texas Rangers, and when they arrive at the ranch they find Meredith with a cache of dope which he says he found in a tree. Strook tries to have Meredith arrest as a dope smuggler, but Meredith shows the Rangers his papers and badge proving he is the Ranger Captain Halliday they have been expecting.
