Vacation

 Bryce, a failing East Coast Jewish banker with a coke habit, books himself and his significantly younger lap-dancer 'girlfriend', Carly, into a seedy Middle Eastern tourist resort. He's hoping for a spot of late-season sun and surf, a last, desperate stab at romance and the happiness that has always eluded him. They are so caught up in their own petty problems that neither of them realize at first that the end is truly nigh - the end of the world and human life. As the sun changes its cycle, freak solar storms take western civilization off-line forever, leaving Bryce and Carly marooned without credit cards in a hostile year-zero society that holds them responsible for the world's pain and despises everything they represent. Faced with harsh existential choices and their own imminent extinction, they inadvertently find themselves, and happiness of a sort, albeit at a price.
