Sharkwise

 The movie takes place in the beautiful settings of Egypt, Mozambique and South Africa, where Marc Sluszny and his team prepare for the ultimate journey. Marc will attempt to dive with the Great White shark outside of the cage. During this road movie we are submerged in the beautiful world beneath the sea. We get to share his failures and successes during his coming of age. Marc must overcome his fears and anxieties enabling him to achieve this goal. This docudrama has also an important ecological message Sharks are not the murderous creatures people think they are. More then 60 millions sharks are killed and finned by men every year to make shark fin soup. It is important that we recognize the real truth. Marc's message to his children and the world is one of courage, motivation and understanding.
