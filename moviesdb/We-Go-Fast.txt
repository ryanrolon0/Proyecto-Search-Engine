We Go Fast

 Rose Couglin (Lynn Bari) is a wise-cracking waitress at a coffee-pot diner with policemen Bob Brandon (Alan Curtis) and Herman Huff (Don DeFore billed as Don DeForest) vying for her attention. Their argument ends when the place is held up, but Brandon tricks the crook and captures him, but lets Herman take the credit. Herman now must sponsor Bob's application to the motorcycle force and is even more dismayed when society deb Diana Hempstead (Sheila Ryan)takes a liking to Bob. Rose also finds herself involved with a swindle upon a refrigerator manufacturer by a bogus foreign potentate, Nabob (Gerald Mohr.)
