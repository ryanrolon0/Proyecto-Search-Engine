The Open Door

 Fred Nuttle is recovering from a nervous breakdown caused by the stress of running his business. His psychiatrist has recommended that he 'get away' for a while. While staying at his sister's condo in Florida and having casual visits with some of her friends he is not prepared for his encounter with a set of precocious, teen-aged twins.
