Runaway Ball

 A boy playing with his ball in the park and the ball bounces away from him. It travels bouncing off a slide and a pram, a dog chases it and it hits a bee hive making the bees angry and chase it. Finally the ball finds an ice cream man who has a fan and when he turns it on it blows the ball back. The boy sees his ball and runs after it, when he is just about to catch it it hits him in the head and while he is falling to the ground the ball bounces into his hands.
