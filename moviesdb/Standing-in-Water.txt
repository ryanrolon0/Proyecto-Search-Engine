Standing in Water

 Written entirely in the Hawaiian Pidgin-English dialect, 'Standing in Water' is a culturally relevant tale about a brother and sister. Ka'ai is full of excitement as she prepares to leave the islands for college. Koa, her estranged brother, struggles with his unfavorable reputation in their family. When an envelope of Ka'ai's graduation money goes mysteriously missing, the siblings are called to communicate in a way they never have before.
