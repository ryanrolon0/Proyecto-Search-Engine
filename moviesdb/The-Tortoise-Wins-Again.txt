The Tortoise Wins Again

 In one of the great (hooray!)spoiler titles of all time, this version of the Hare vs. Tortoise fable finds the contest being done on ice skates between teams of rabbits and turtles, and the turtles cheat like crazy...and, since the title tells all, I suppose it's okay to mention the plodders win again.
