The Freshwater Plague

 As the sun sets over North Bay the city is overrun by hundreds of thousands of insects called shadflies. Once the scope of this invasion is revealed the documentary explores the shadfly's physical identity, life cycle, behaviours, etc. before delving deeper into the poetically tragic life of the fly. Finally, the video touches on how people interact with the species and what we may be able to learn from them.
