Post Mikey

 At an amusement park called Mikeytown, Norman is Mikey, roaming the park in a muskrat suit, spreading good cheer. Trouble is, Norman's a bit of a sad sack, and he's so upset one day when he sees his boss Gavin making out with an employee Norman likes, he dons the wrong character's head and causes havoc in the park. Gavin fires him, but the park's owner wants Norman back. Gavin goes to Norman's, makes some discoveries, and faces Norman's conditions. Will peace return to Mikeytown?
