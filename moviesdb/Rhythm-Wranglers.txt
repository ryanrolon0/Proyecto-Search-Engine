Rhythm Wranglers

 Ray Whitley and his Bar-Six musical cowboys apply for work at the Bar-X ranch. The owner refuses at first but gives in when his niece intercedes. When the owner of the Lazy Q hears the music, she steps foot on the Bar-X for the first time in years. Ray and the girl get the two owners together and they decide to marry and merge the ranches.
