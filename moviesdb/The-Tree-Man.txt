The Tree Man

 Set between chapters 15 and 16 of Carlo Collodi's classic novel 'The Adventures of Pinocchio', 'The Tree Man' depicts Pinocchio's seemingly final minutes as he hangs from a tree. As he slowly dies, he spiritually journeys into an inferno of fear, guilt and hope through his encounters with key symbolic characters such as the Maiden with Azure Hair and the ghost of the Talking Cricket. As he falls deeper into darkness, Pinocchio learns the crucial dangers and virtues of the mortality he seeks.
