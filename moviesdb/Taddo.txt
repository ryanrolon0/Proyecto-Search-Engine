Taddo

 Taddo is the story of "the oldest barber in Brooklyn." An ex-boxer, guitar player and tango aficionado, Salvatore "Taddo" Camarda is the product of a gritty Brooklyn neighborhood, and he has held onto his shop, and the craft of cutting hair for a lifetime. Enter Taddo's barbershop, and you enter the magical world of a legendary Brooklyn craftsman. Though business may be failing, and the neighborhood is changing faster than he cares for, Taddo has endured. From the days when mom-and-pop stores and pushcart vendors accented the urban streets to the anonymous supermarkets of today, Taddo's grace, humor and humanity have shone through. And so has his love for life, his friends and "a good scissor haircut."
