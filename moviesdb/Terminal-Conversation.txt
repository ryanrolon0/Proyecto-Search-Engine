Terminal Conversation

 Dave is traveling for business. He gets a call from his wife. "It's over," she says, "There's someone else." What would you do if the one you loved left you? Dave desperately searches for these answers on his own. At the airport, he unexpectedly receives guidance from a strange man who strikes up a conversation. Now, as he heads home, Dave finds himself on a much greater journey.
