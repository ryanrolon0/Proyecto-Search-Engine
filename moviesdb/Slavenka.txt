Slavenka

 It's September 9, 1995 student. Her first task? To give a speech auf Deutsch in German IV. When she figures out that only one kid in class, Morton, understands German, Slavenka makes a decision that leaves her wishing she'd never crossed the Atlantic. Morton tries to come to the rescue - but a language whiz is the last thing Slavenka is looking for.
