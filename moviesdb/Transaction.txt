Transaction

 Based on transcripts of an interview with an actual call girl working for over 22 years, "Transaction" is a frank and affecting cinema verite-style depiction of the interaction between a client and call girl that leaves the audience to determine their own feelings about that dynamic. The shooting style also provides a subtle examination of point of view, shifting energies/control and the commodification of sex.
