The Silver-Plated Gun

 Avenged, the outlaw took his way into the mountains. The sheriff followed. Hour after hour the hunt went on, from hill to valley, from the open to the woods. Both struggled against exhaustion, leaned frequently against some boulder to regain their breath and wits. Slipping from one rock to another, the bandit ever eluded search and ever the sheriff followed. When human strength could stand no longer, the bandit sank down, is silver-plated gun glistening in the sun. And then the miracle happened. The reflection of the sun on the silver-plated gun shone straight into the tired eyes of the sheriff. He looked up, followed the glistening light and, with fun in hand, bagged his exhausted fugitive. With gun before him the sheriff followed the bandit into town.
