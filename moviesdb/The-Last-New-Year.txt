The Last New Year

 The story of the "The Fools and Bastards Club," a group of ten close friends who made a pact in high school to reunite every December 31st to ring in the new year together. Eight year later, what started as a simple party has evolved into a sacred tradition which preserves friendships that have otherwise grown apart. However, this year, one of the core members has mysteriously disappeared, leaving the rest to struggle with what has happened. At the center are Penny and William and a secret linked to their friend's disappearance, which could easily tear the group apart for good. Ultimately, they must decide what is more important, keeping the dark truth to themselves or keeping the "The Fools and Bastards" together.
