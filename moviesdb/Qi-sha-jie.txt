Qi sha jie

 A Japanese nightclub is poisoning a Chinese village with morphine and opium, making addicts of the locals. A doctor offers free treatments, but the Japanese put a stop to it by falsely accusing him of malpractice and extorting money from him. The doctor's young assistant seeks to avenge the man who is his employer, guardian and future father-in-law. But the duplicitous wife of an addict and the vengeful men from the nightclub will stand in his way. His worst enemy of all will be a man called the Chairman, with his fingers of death.
