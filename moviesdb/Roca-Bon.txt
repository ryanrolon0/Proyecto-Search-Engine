Roca Bon

 Sara, an Art student, is keen on New York's Abstract Expressionism, and more specifically on Mark Tobey's work. Sara starts a research about that movement and its influence on today's painters, which in turn leads her to the Catalan painter Roca Bon. Sara is so fascinated by Roca Bon's work that she decides to travel to Cadaques and Barcelona in order to discover his inspiration and motivations for producing such an artwork. Sara also looks for something that goes beyond the mere art form, something that is related to the human identity.
