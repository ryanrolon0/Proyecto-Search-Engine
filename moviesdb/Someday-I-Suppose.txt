Someday I Suppose

 Kevin, an up and coming advertising executive, thinks he has his life in good order. A job he likes, a fiancEe he loves, and an overall sense of well being...Until he receives a call from his estranged mother who tells him that her lesbian partner has just died of a heart attack. Upon returning to his childhood home Kevin's once simple life spirals in to the unknown as he reunites with the lesbian lover's daughter who he grew up and they have sex at the funeral...on a gravestone. Forced to take a closer look at where he is in his life, Kevin begins to realize that the more he sorts things out, the more they get distorted.
