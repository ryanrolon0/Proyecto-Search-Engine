Scrambles

 This biker documentary was selected for screening at the 1964 Flaherty Film Seminar. Emshwiller described it as "a roaring picture of motorcyclists in action. Modern Lancelots and their ladies-in-waiting go wide open for a day at the races. An impressionistic film of guys and gals who get their kicks in direct physical action."
