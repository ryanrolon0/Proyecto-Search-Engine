The Crisis Mr. Faubus Made

 It was the biggest event in the state's history and a time of testing and triumph for Arkansas's first newspaper. This film tells the story of the Arkansas Gazette's leadership during the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in 1957, an important chapter in the state's history that has not been fully told until now. Academy Award-winning actress Mary Steenburgen lends her voice to this telling of the story that changed Arkansas and the South forever and cemented the Gazette's status as one of the nation's most prestigious newspapers.
