Raising Hell

 An incumbant governor, facing possible indictment for racketeering and steadily slipping numbers in the polls, sets upon ensuring the upcoming election. Using an object of religious might, the Keys of Solomon, he compels a demon to eliminate all those who oppose him. The Keys, once a gift bestowed upon Peter by Jesus Christ, hold the strength to bind the forces of heaven and hell. Lost for centuries, they have been the most sought artifacts by the church, since the Ark of the Covenant. The Jesuits, the defenders of the faith, have been entrusted with the task of reattaining these prized possessions.........at any cost. To this day, cloaked in secrecy, they scour the earth in search of the lost artifacts. Present day.....here, now......unbeknownst to anyone, the governor lays siege to the city. As violent deaths slowly stack up, the connections begin to point to their source. Caught in his wake of bloodshed is Zack Alder, a press representative for the governor. He, with the help of officer Lynn Russell, races against time to learn the truth and ultimately stop the governor from achieving his political resolve.
