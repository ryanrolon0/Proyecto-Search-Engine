Visible Silence

 Features 43 of Hartley's paintings and drawings as well as many photographs from his early youth to his final years. Drawing heavily from Hartley's little-known poetical works, this documentary, a deeply personal statement by Michael Maglaras, captures the essence of Hartley -- long considered one of the most important American painters of the first half of the 20th century. Visible Silence is the first documentary ever made about this Maine-born painter.
