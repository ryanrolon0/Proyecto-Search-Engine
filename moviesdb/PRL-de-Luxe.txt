PRL de Luxe

 Crazy Mike from Cracow organizes unusual tours for tourists from the West. He takes them to the Nowa Huta district in a clapped-out old bus, together they visit the relics of the past - the Stylowa restaurant, the place where Lenin's monument used to stand, steelworks, a typical workers' flat. While visiting these places he tells tourists stories about the lure of life in the communists Poland and the absurdities of real socialism. Is this trip going to leave any trace in them?
