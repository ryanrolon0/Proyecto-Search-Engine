Ridin' the Rails

 Johnny Cash was well-known to be somewhat of a train aficionado, and many of his most famous songs have a train theme, so who better to tell the history of the great American railways, their rise and their fall? With his guitar, he guides us from the humble beginnings in the early 19th century to the modern day diesel engines. There are also re-enactments of some of the most important events in US railway history.
