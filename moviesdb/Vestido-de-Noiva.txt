Vestido de Noiva

 In 1942, in Rio de Janeiro, the twenty-five years old Alaíde is run over while crossing Carioca Street. She arrives in coma in the hospital, and while being submitted to an emergency surgery, she recalls her life since her family moved to a former brothel, mixing hallucination, reality and memory. In her surrealistic daydream, she meets Madame Clessy, the owner of the bordello that died in 1905, killed by her seventeen years old lover, and she tells a passionate and tragic love story between her husband Pedro, her jealous sister Lúcia and herself, and how Madame Clessy died.
