Sam's Rain

 Sam's Rain takes us into the story of Justin, a young man who has just returned home from his tour of duty in Iraq. He never knew that his service to the Country he loves could bring about such hardships and pain after returning to it. Justin is welcomed back with open arms by his friends and family. He is looked upon as a hero of battle...but such honors can't possibly hide the physical and mental anguish that will emerge as the toughest battle of his life. As you see Justin's internal battle unfold, you sense his desire to overcome the traumatic military experience and return to his normal life. But as the war within him rages on, he begins to see the home he left behind in a new light. He will learn that his friends, family and perhaps his whole life....was never what it seemed, to begin with. Nothing in Justin's life is familiar to him anymore. Nothing in his military training could prepare him for what lies ahead. If he has learned anything... ...it's that Nothing Stays the Same
