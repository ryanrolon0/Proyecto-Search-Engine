Roughing It

 A film crew looking for big foot. A boy scout troop lost for three days, a group of friends balancing out the burial of their friend with their alcohol consumption, and a guy trying to get back his girl (while dressed in a gorilla costume). In real life there are no main characters... In real life there are no lines... In real life there is no script. A film crew looking for big foot. A boy scout troop lost for three days, a group of friends balancing out the burial of their friend with their alcohol consumption, and a guy trying to get back his girl (while dressed in a gorilla costume). Everything comes together for a hilarious, completely improvised comedy.
