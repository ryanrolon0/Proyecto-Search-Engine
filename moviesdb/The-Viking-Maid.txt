The Viking Maid

 Despite record salmon runs in the state of Alaska, wild Salmon fishermen struggle to stay afloat in the flooded salmon markets of the world. This documentary is a journey aboard an Alaskan salmon seining vessel, exploring the lifestyle and adventure of a dying breed of men, the last of hunters and gatherers who dare to take on mother nature to earn a living. Journey aboard the Viking Maid, atop the erratic seas of Southeast Alaska, and find out why you should always ask, "is this salmon farmed or wild?"
