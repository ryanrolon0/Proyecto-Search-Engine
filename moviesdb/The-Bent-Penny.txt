The Bent Penny

 Jerry meets the Bank Clerk when depositing his savings into his account, little does Jerry know that the clerk is not as honest as he seems. A lonely Coroner meets a confident young woman at a train station and together, luck rewards them with more than they expected. A deceitful businessman falls prey to a corrupt club-owner when his credit expires in a nightclub. All display a human characteristic which defines their attitude towards money and how they relate to each other.
