Restore Fairness

 Since the Declaration of Independence, America has striven to uphold fairness and due process. But today, a broken immigration system denies basic human rights and due process to people who live here. In the aftermath of 9-11, immigrants have borne the brunt of harsh policies, with the U.S. government allowing raids and arrests without warrants, holding thousands in inhumane detention conditions, and deporting people without a fair trial. Restore Fairness produced by Breakthrough in association with 26 leading human rights and immigration organizations calls for due process and fairness in the U.S. immigration system.
