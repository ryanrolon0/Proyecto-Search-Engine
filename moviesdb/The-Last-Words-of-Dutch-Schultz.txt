The Last Words of Dutch Schultz

 In 1935, mobster Dutch Schultz was using the bathroom at the Palace chophouse in New York when Charles "Charlie the Bug" Workman walked into the back room and shot dead three of Schultz's associates "Abbadabba" Berman, number one henchman Abe Landau, and bodyguard Bernard "Lulu" Rosenkrantz. Schultz was still standing at the urinal in shock when Workman strolled in and shot him below the heart. When paramedics arrived, Schultz had dragged himself out and was sitting bleeding at his table. For the next twenty hours, police stenographers recorded his unbelievable death, as he rambled a few thousand bizarre words before finally muttering something unintelligable and then dying. This film is an abstract representation of what Schultz was trying to say.
