Quantum Roulette

 The Nuclear Industry evolves the final weapon, a quark canon that will produce mass-bombs and could cause the big bang of Earth into a nova (pulsar or black hole). But physicists are in denial, protecting a 13 billion $ machine & scholar ambitions. They lied to a naive press, saying quarks are harmless, cosmic rays, and the canon will find the origin of the Universe. And now are ready to play a game of Russian Roulette with Earth.
