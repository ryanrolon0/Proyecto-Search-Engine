Vacationing in Afghanistan

 Leaving the chaotic confines of Kabul, "Vacationing in Afghanistan" enters a world rarely seen by Westerners. Crossing Afghanistan's mountainous region to the enormous Buddha statues left in ruins by the Taliban, the focus of this film is not the wild and stunning landscape which it is set in, but the simple interaction between two very different cultures, and the common bonds found by the characters on this journey.
