Rock Pool

 I came down, I wanted to see the ocean again... Five feet under, your lungs robbed for air, you can't breathe. Daylight is breaking through the surface, but out of reach. Then the waves come crashing in so you run. You run as far away as you can, coughing raindrops no more. Rock Pool is a true reflection of how international travel enables us to see how chance meetings can change our lives forever.
