State of Play

 A petty thief is gunned down in an alley and a Congressman's assistant falls in front of a subway - two seemingly unrelated deaths. But not to wisecracking, brash newspaper reporter Cal McAffrey who spies a conspiracy waiting to be uncovered. With a turbulent past connected to the Congressman and the aid of ambitious young rookie writer Della Frye, Cal begins uprooting clues that lead him to a corporate cover-up full of insiders, informants, and assassins. But as he draws closer to the truth, the relentless journalist must decide if it's worth risking his life and selling his soul to get the ultimate story. When an aide to prominent US Congressman Stephen Collins dies in what initially appears to be an accident, two journalists from the Washington Globe newspaper investigate when they obtain information that it may not have been an accident. The dead woman was the Congressman's chief researcher in hearings concerning a private sector security firm supplementing the use of US Armed Forces around the world. She was also Collins' lover. The two journalists have contrasting styles is a traditional print journalist who uses his contacts in the police department to get his information while Della Frye uses new media such as blogging to get her information out to the public quickly. As they delve into the role the private company might play in domestic security, McCaffrey also realizes they have all been duped into making one serious, but false, assumption.
