President Mitchell's Speech

 Here is President Mitchell himself addressing the miners and their admirers at Wilkes-Barre, Pa. If you want an effective and striking picture, buy the strike parade [MITCHELL DAY AT WILKES-BARRE, PA.] and join it on the front end of the Mitchell's Speech Film. You will then have 150 feet of a subject that will enthuse any audience. The moving picture of Mitchell making his speech is the most striking one of its character we have ever made.
