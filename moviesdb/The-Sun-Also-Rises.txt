The Sun Also Rises

 This is the 1980s made for TV version of the Ernest hemingway novel about an ex-soldier who suffered some sort of injury to his genitals during World War I. Instead of going back home to the USA, he hangs out in Paris with a bunch of other wounded souls, some wounded physically, others wounded psychologically.
