The Whizzard of Ow

 Wile E. Coyote is chasing the Road Runner (still) and comes across the Acme Book of Magic. With the power to levitate heavy boulders, fly on broomsticks, and transfigure anything to suit his need, it seems like Wile E. finally has a chance at getting his breakfast... but then again, this is Wile E. Coyote we're talking about.
