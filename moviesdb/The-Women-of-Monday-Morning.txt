The Women of Monday Morning

 This is a documentary about a group of women who meet every Monday morning for the past 13 yrs. They have found enlightenment and a oneness of mind, body, and spirit, through dance. This unique class blends movement exploration with poetry, drawing, and play to create a opportunity for enlightenment.
