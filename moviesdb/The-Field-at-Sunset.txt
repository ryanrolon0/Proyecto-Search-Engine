The Field at Sunset

 'The Field at Sunset' gives an intimate perspective into the psychological turmoil of Leonard, an odd, socially inept man who lives in isolation, and how disarrayed his mind becomes when a neighbor woman unexpectedly takes an interest in his eccentric lifestyle. The dynamic relationship becomes both difficult and beautiful for both people in this portrait of human frustration and loneliness.
