Sahara no se vende

 In April 2007, during the celebration of the 4th edition of Sahara International Film Festival, three friends embark on the adventure of running a photography workshop for young refugees in the refugee camp of Dajla in south Algeria. The pictures produced by the seventeen participants in the course allow them to discover a rather striking reality, how after thirty three years of waiting in the Hammada, the most inhospitable area of the Algerian desert, the Saharawi refugees are in a critical situation, on the verge of desperation with no patience left and ready to resume the armed struggle against the occupying Moroccan forces A very dynamic and fresh editing is accompanied with rhythms and superb songs from well renowned international artists in order to create a superb language that takes us closer to the forgotten Saharawi people, a people with an unclear future. The film is a visual trip through the history of the Saharawi people and its situation on the refugee camps in south Algeria and the keys for the future of a conflict that lasts for over 33 years.
