We Are the Beautiful

 In a fictional New York Gateway city called Mount Fortune, one woman's preternatural talent for violence transforms her from rebellious teen to leading her family's epic rise against the town's lawless, but well-entrenched criminal underground. She is trained to fight by a loving yet ruthlessly ambitious mother; she is trained to kill by her mother's level-headed business partner. While the irresistible thrill of The Hunt tames her; the pressures of a life she doesn't want finally sets her free.
