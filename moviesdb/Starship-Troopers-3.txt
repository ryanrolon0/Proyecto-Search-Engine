Starship Troopers 3

 The war against the Bugs continues! A Federation Starship crash-lands on the distant Alien planet OM-1, stranding beloved leader Sky Marshal Anoke and several others, including comely but tough pilot Lola Beck. It's up to Colonel/General Johnny Rico, reluctant hero of the original Bug Invasion on Planet P, to lead a team of Troopers on a daring rescue mission. In the front-line of the Second Bug War in planet Roku San, the charismatic Sky Marshal Omar Anoke arrives with his assistant General Dix Hauser in an starship piloted by his fiancEe Captain Lola Beck and they are welcomed by their friend and hero of Planet P Colonel Johnny Rico. While Anoke inspects the facility protected by fences, Dix, Lola and Rico go to a bar to celebrate their reunion. However, Dix has an incident with the local farmers and arrests Rico for insubordination; meanwhile, there is a shut down in the defense fences and the bugs break into the facility. Lola and Anoke escape in the starship, but it crashes in Planet OM-1 and Lola, Anoke, Chief Bull Brittles, Jingo Ryan, Dr. Wiggs and the religious flight attendant Holly Little save themselves in a rescue pod. When Dix discovers that Admiral Enolo Phid has no intention to rescue the survivors in the Arachnid Quarantine Zone, he assigns Rico in the Marauder Program to lead a squad with six other troopers to rescue Lola and Anoke.
