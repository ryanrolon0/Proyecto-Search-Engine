Racing the Freak

 Brings viewers deep into road racing, a sport that takes harness racing off the dirt track of the arena to the asphalt of major roadways. It follows Joe, the owner of Ireland's fasted pacer, a Dublin native known as "The Bobby," through two of the biggest races of his career. First in Limerick, Bobby represents Dublin in a competition between the fastest horse from Dublin and the fastest horse from Limerick. The prize is $166,000, the largest in history, and bragging rights as the best horse in Ireland. Next, Joe and Bobby cross the channel to England to race head to head with the only horse ever credited with beating "The Bobby." Road racing thrives in Dublin's pubs as well, where the passion of racing is on display nightly. Between pints, horse owners watch and discuss road racing into the early hours of the morning. "Racing the Freak" takes the audience on a fast-paced ride into the urban horse culture of Ireland and England, showing not only the gambling that makes this sport controversial but also the relationship between horse and owner that money can never buy.
