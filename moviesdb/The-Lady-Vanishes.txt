The Lady Vanishes

 On an express train traveling through pre-World War II Germany, American heiress Amanda Kelly befriends a cute old nanny, Miss Froy. But when Miss Froy disappears, everyone Amanda questions denies having ever seen her. Eventually Amanda persuades American photographer Robert Condon to help her search the train, during which they discover that Miss Froy wasn't quite what she seemed.
