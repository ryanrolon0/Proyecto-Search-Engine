The Inside Passage

 In this pre-World War II (for the United States) short James FitzPatrick points his camera at Seattle, Washington on a map and takes his camera and commentary up the inland waterway to Alaska. The short depicts the salmon fishing at Ketchikan, and moves on to an Indian village to show the art of the Totem Pole carving. Also shown is the important salmon port of Cordova, and Annette Island where the culture of the Alaskan Indian reaches its highest point.
