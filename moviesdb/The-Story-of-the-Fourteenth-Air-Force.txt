The Story of the Fourteenth Air Force

 This documentary depicts the American effort to support the Chinese government before and during the Second World War, by means of transport flights of materiel from India to China, by the fierce defense of China skies by the pilots of the American Volunteer Group (The Flying Tigers), and the subsequent absorption and augmentation of that unit by the U.S. Army Air Forces' Fourteenth Air Force. Also depicted are the millions of refugees fleeing the Japanese armies and the relocation of equipment, personnel, and (sometimes) civilians in advance of the invaders.
