The Nisei Farmer

 Winner of the Grand Prize for Best Short Film at the 2003 Rhode Island International Film Festival, The Nisei Farmer is a poignant tale of a man who must free himself to love again. When the U.S. government makes reparations for the injustices suffered by the Japanese Americans during World War II, memories of a stolen youth haunt a Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) farmer in northern California. The film explores how the incarceration of the Japanese Americans affected one life and held him emotionally captive long after the war ended. The Nisei Farmer was created as a way for the filmmaker to honor his late father, who spent three years of his childhood in an internment camp on American soil because of his last name.
