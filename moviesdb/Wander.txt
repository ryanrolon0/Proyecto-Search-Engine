Wander

 Evan is a bored young man who is looking after his late grandmother's estate in the Midwest. Holly is a traveling photographer who lives a transient and seemingly free-spirited life. After meeting through Couch Surfing, an on-line travel collective, Evan decides to let Holly stay at his grandmother's house temporarily. They are immediately fascinated by one another's lifestyle. When Holly asks Evan to join her on the road, he must decide what his priorities are and how much trust he can put into this new friend. Wander is a story about loneliness, wanderlust, and first impressions.
