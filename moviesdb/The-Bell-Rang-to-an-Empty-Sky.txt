The Bell Rang to an Empty Sky

 This film has taken one of the many tragedies buried in American history, which befell the American Indian and, through the voice of Dennis Banks, creates a tight visual and aural telling and interpretation of the events. The selection of the images, their iconography and meaning, effectively explored through juxtaposition, creates a powerful work.
