Under Heaven

 Cynthia and Buck are a young couple with little but love. Soon Cynthia drops the cough syrup and beer drinking Buck princess did not involve an unemployed boyfriend who steals steaks and fruit-pies under his shirt. Setting out on her own, a devastated Buck left behind, Cynthia gets a job caring for rich but terminally ill Eleanor. As God would have it, Buck comes back into the picture. Cynthia persuades him to charm the self-conscious Eleanor, to gain favors in her will. What ensues is an intense love triangle, a passionate example of the redeeming power of love and forgiveness. Cynthia and Buck are young working-class couple who serve for rich lady Eleanor Dunston, who is dying of cancer. When Cynthia sees the physical attraction Eleanor feels toward Buck, she demands he should start an affair with Eleanor (Eleanor doesn't know Cynthia and Buck are married) to get to her money.
