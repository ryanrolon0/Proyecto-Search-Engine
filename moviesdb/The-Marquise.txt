The Marquise

 When a Count and a Duke, having been close friends since their youth, want their respective children to marry each other, the young couple concerned, Adrienne and Miguel, are not happy with this arrangement, for, although fond of each other, they both love someone else. Just when all seems lost, the beautiful and vivacious Marquise, who had been a close friend of both noblemen, arrives unexpectedly at the Count's home and takes charge of the affair - to the complete satisfaction of all.
