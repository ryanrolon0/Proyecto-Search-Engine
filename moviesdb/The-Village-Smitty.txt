The Village Smitty

 Flip the Frog is a happy blacksmith who makes horseshoes. A cat is riding by in a horse and carriage when her horse loses a shoe. She takes her horse to Flip to have the shoe repaired, but problems arise when the horse is spooked by a mosquito and runs away with the cat still in the carriage. Flip must stop the runaway horse before it and its owner are both thrown from a cliff.
