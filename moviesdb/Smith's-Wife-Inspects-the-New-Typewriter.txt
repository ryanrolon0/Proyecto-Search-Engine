Smith's Wife Inspects the New Typewriter

 A brokers office. A broker is dictating to typewriter, who is very homely, when the wife and child appear on the scene, and his wife proceeds to inspect the typewriter and expresses her approval of his selection. His wife leaves, the typewriter removes her mask, disclosing a beautiful face, and Smith proceeds (to) make love to her.
