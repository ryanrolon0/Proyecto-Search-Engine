Preuﬂisch Gangstar

 "Prussian Gangstar" is a slice of life view of three youths in small-town Brandenburg. The idyllic setting and the modest prosperity of the community mask the problems with which the young people have to contend. Nico is a school drop-out, dreaming of a hip-hop career. Tino, in an effort to satisfy the expectations of his mother, struggles to gain his lower school certificate. Oli wants to open a club, but his girlfriend dreams of their leaving their hum-drum provincial life behind them. The difficulties seem routine enough. Nonetheless, an unfathomable void develops between their youthful values and those of their parents. Only their friendship gives them a degree of security. Together they are the "Prussian Gangstars".
