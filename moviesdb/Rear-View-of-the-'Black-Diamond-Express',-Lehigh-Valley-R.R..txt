Rear View of the 'Black Diamond Express', Lehigh Valley R.R.

 Quite unlike the approaching scene [LEHIGH VALLEY EXPRESS "BLACK DIAMOND"] of this most popular train, the audience first sees the track and mountain in the background, when the train suddenly dashes into view, going at a rate of about seventy miles an hour. In this manner the train speeds down the track for more than half a mile, when it rounds a curve in the road, disappearing from view.
