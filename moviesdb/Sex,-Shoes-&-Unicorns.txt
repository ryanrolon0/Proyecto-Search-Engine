Sex, Shoes & Unicorns

 The "Shoe Unicorn" is that mythological straight man who knows all about women's shoes. When he befriends Taylor and becomes her platonic shopping partner jealousy ensues when once Mimi beds him. The four girlfriends (Taylor, Mimi, Chloe and Bridgette) see their friendship crumble as they are forced to choose between girlfriends, boyfriends and loaning their new shoes to each other.
