 Fresh printed bank notes to the value of incredible 10 billion rupies are stolen in India from a train by the henchmen of super-gangster Vikram living in London. The code card only being able to open the container with the money comes into the possession of beautiful Chandralekha. On the way to Vikram she comes across the two thieves Kadir and Azhagu who are on the run from the police - having in tow country-girl Rajathi whom they kept from committing suicide and who then ran away from her ruthless uncle. After some attempts of cheating each other Chandralekha is making friends with the thieves. When she discovers that Vikram is stopping at nothing - especially not at dead bodies - on his hunt after the loot, she informs the three others about the real value of the code card. In the following pursuit between Vikram, the four heroes and a special police brigade which has to get back the money before a state crisis comes about, not only fierce action, but also love comes to its own. Portly CBI Inspector Laxminarayan is assigned to track down 1000 Crore Rupees worth of stolen currency from the Government Security Press in Nasik. His assignment will lead him to Ashok Tejani, and then to two burglars in Tamil Nadu, Shankar and Anand, who are on the run from the Police along with a suicidal village belle, Kajri. Laxminarayan's efforts will be frustrated even more after Ashok is killed and his gun-toting Goa-based girlfriend, Chandralekha, is absconding; and the entry of an international drug dealer, simply known as Vikram, who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the loot.
