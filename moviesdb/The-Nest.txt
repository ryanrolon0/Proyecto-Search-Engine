The Nest

 One morning. Two points of view. It is seemingly just another school morning for Laura and her mother, Alice. But hidden beneath the surface each experiences their banal conversation differently. A film that weaves oil painted animation with live action film, to peel back the layers of consciousness and reveal the ambiguities suspended in one family's dark history.
