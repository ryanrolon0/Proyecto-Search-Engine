The Little Cloud

 Steam from the ocean creates a little cloud who is eager to do good for Man. Before bidding him goodbye, the ocean warns the little white cloud that if he comes too close to the warm earth, he'll turn back into water again. Later, the cloud encounters black clouds holding lightning bolts. He hopes they'll give him advice on how to do good for Man. Being so small, he can't even provide shade to protect Man from the hot sun. But the black clouds are interested only in harming Man. They create a storm that destroys the gardens and farms and all the vegetables in them. The little cloud weeps, which fills him with water and makes him grow huge. Now, Man prays for a gentle rain so that their crops can grow again. The little cloud, with tears of joy, realizes how he can help Man at last.
