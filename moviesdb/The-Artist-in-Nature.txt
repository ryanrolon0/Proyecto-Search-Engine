The Artist in Nature

 The Artist in Nature first film to showcase this celebrated artist's spectacular plein air works. The show host, M. Stephen Doherty, tells the fascinating history of the plein air tradition, with insightful commentary that explores Kinkade's personal, artistic, and spiritual developments as they relate to his approach to painting in nature. Kinkade is shown painting on location dealing with the challenges involved when painting seascapes, mountains, deserts, buildings, and foreign locations-along with demonstrations of painting a Cotswold cottage scene and other exotic locations. Finally, art lovers will be treated to a full- color gallery of Kinkade's finest plein air paintings, all accompanied by an original sound track. M. Stephen Doherty is editor-in-chief of American Artist Magazine. He serves on the advisory boards of several arts organizations and is a frequent judge at national art competitions.
