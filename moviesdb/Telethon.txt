Telethon

 Telethon is about two talented acts waiting to perform in Sammy Davis Jr.'s ill-fated 1973 telethon for highway safety. Actress Esosa Edosomwan portrays singer/dancer/performer Lola Falana as she prepares for her appearance and takes her bow. Repetition, practice, routines, timing, patience, applause and keeping the balls in the air. Both backstage and on stage, where "the minutes seem like hours".
