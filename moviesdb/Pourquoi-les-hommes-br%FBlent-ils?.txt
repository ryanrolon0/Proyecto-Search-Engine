Pourquoi les hommes brûlent-ils?

 On January 31 1980, in Guatemala, while the civil war between the military dictatorship and the Marxist guerrillas drags on, 32 representatives of Indian peasant associations arrive from each corner of the country and occupy pacifically the Spain embassy to claim their rights. None of them come out of it alive. All are burned live by the military junta in power. Only the ambassador survives. In memory of that massacre, today, Why do humans burn? Takes a critical look at the present.
