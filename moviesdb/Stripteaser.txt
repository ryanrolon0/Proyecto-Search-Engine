Stripteaser

 As Zipper's Clown Palace (a strip bar) closes, Neil wanders in and decides to hold the dancers, bartender, and remaining customers hostage. He torments them with little tasks he wants performed, playing on their weaknesses and relying on his gun for intimidation. Eventually the hostages begin formulating plans to thwart his control. Meanwhile, two policemen are observing the outside of the strip joint, realizing that something's wrong and trying to decide if it's worth ruining their buzz to intervene. Zipper's Clown Palace... a nightclub where every man's fantasy becomes a reality... in the flesh. But for exotic dancer Christina Martin, tonight's reality turns deadly. When a blind vagrant enters the bar for a last call drink, pleasure turns to panic as he pulls a gun and holds Christina hostage. What follows is a deadly confrontation between man and woman... between good and evil... between madness and sanity. Set against the erotic backdrop of LA's late night striptease clubs, STRIPTEASER delivers an unforgettable story of what it takes to be a woman... and what it takes to kill one.
