This Is My Family

 The irresistible effect of children's art is the starting point in this movie in which kids reflect on our culture using their original artwork to explore how the idea of FAMILY shapes and defines our lives. Between 7 and 14 years old, they describe and comment on the influences of their families-- the good, the bad, the past, present and future. Inter cutting interviews with beautiful and vibrantly expressive original art, the kids share their understandings of what makes a family; their family's origins; their images of future families; and ends with some poetically insightful utterings on the meaning, power and importance of having a family.
