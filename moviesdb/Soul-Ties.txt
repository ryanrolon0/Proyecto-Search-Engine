Soul Ties

 We follow Isabella's hopes and her heart in her relationships. Part of the heartbreak and pain of relationships is that we do not realize that we are made 'one flesh' in our relationships as we enter them emotionally, intellectually, physically and spiritually.

Contractual relationships are risky because a man and a woman agree to love and be faithful to one another until one finds a better option. We live in a culture dominated by a consumer market. People change, new options present themselves. If it doesn't work out, they can always opt out. Covenantal marriage is even more risky but in the end that security, trust and love in a person is what we all seek..
