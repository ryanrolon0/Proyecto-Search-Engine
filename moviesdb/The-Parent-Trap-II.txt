The Parent Trap II

 Mary and Nicki are best friends and they want their unsuspecting single parent's to marry. Nicki's mother Sharon (the twin of Susan) wants to move to New York City though. With the help of Susan, they try to get the two together. Hayley Mills plays twins again in this first of three TV sequels to her fondly remembered 1961 film, The Parent Trap. Here, one of the twins is a divorced mother whose 11-year-old daughter, Nicki, befriends another girl, Mary, in summer school. Mary has a widowed father, (Tom Skerritt) so naturally the two girls try to get them together. But the mother wants to move, so they have to act fast. Eventually, the mother's twin sister is brought in to aid them.
