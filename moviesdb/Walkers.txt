Walkers

 A mock-documentary looks at three different style of those involved in walking. One is an Executive Walker - trained to walk around urban areas in a suit and help the economy by making the place look busy and thus bolstering confidence in the city. Another is a young freestyle walker who has built in skateboard tricks to walking and is looking for that next buzz or move. The final is a solo walker who does the more traditional form of walking for long distances across country.
