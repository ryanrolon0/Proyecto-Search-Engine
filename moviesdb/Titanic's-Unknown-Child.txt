Titanic's Unknown Child

 Fifteen hundred people lost their lives when the majestic ocean liner struck an iceberg. One body recovered from the frigid waters became a symbol of the tragedy and the horrible loss of life. It was a young boy, a baby really, less than two years old. This Unknown Child was buried in Halifax with other Titanic victims and only now has the mystery been solved. Modern science has made it possible to prove who the Unknown Child was. He now has a family and a name.
