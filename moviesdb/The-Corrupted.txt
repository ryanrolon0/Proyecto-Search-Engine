The Corrupted

 I'm With Hobo Productions & Spooktree Films presents the Feature-length sci-fi/horror 'THE CORRUPTED'. A man quietly strums his guitar at the edge of a lake. Through the darkness we see a woman emerge, silent and mysterious. She approaches and whispers something into his ear. When she beckons, he has no choice but to follow.When his friends arrive, its obvious...something in him has changed. What did the woman tell him? Why does he seem so distant? Where did she take him? A completely Albertan, truly independent film shot on the REDONE camera over 17 days in the summer of 2009. An intellectual sci-fi with an action packed climax, The Corrupted keeps you intensely entertained from start to finish.
