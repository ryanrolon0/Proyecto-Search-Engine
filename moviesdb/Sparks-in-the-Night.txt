Sparks in the Night

 Set in a black-and-white 1940's, "Sparks in the Night" humorously follows detective Leon Sparks as he closes in on notorious lawbreaker Jerry Walker and the Speeder Brothers. Working with a cast of fellow eighth-graders, the 13-year-old director encapsulates the mood, moral ambiguity, menace, and fun of the grimy city.
