Two Moon Junction

 April has just graduated from an exclusive Southern college. She's just returned home to her family mansion to prepare for her semi-arranged marriage to "the right man", a man approved by April's father, a Senator. During a trip to the local fair, April meets Perry, the kind of man she always wanted but never knew. Her parents are aghast, as Perry is exactly the kind of man they don't want her associating with. April must reconcile the expectations of her family and her fiancEe with the passion she feels for Perry. April is a shy, beautiful young southern girl who is engaged to a handsome wealthy man named Chad. April loves him, but one day, April and her sisters go to a local carnival and meets a muscle bound worker named Perry. April doesn't think much of him at first. April parents who are both respected politicians, leave town for a few days and April stays with her cankerous grandmother Belle, but April is more closer to Belle's housekeeper Delilah and asks her to cover for her while April goes back to the carnival. Belle, aware of what she is going to do, asks Sheriff Hawkins to spy on her. April returns to the carnival to find Perry, drunk and disordered. Perry's friend, Patti Jean asks April to go with her on a night on the town, so Perry can sober up. While April and Patti Jean are gone, Perry's enemy and carnival gambler Smiley!
