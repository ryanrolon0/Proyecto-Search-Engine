The Door-to-Door Rope Saleswoman & Other Tales

 Bondage filled tale of double-dealing and intrigue. In the first vignette, a door-to-door rope salesman demonstrates her wares on an unsuspecting customer. In the next story, two women will do anything to obtain the lucrative rope contract at the local hardware store, including leaving their opponent in a bind and unable to make her sales presentation. In the third tale, two lovely ladies are innocent victims when thugs try to steal a secret formula. The fourth yarn is a homage to "Arsenic and Old Lace." A security guard discovers a beautiful and influential film critic tightly gagged and securely roped to a chair and refuses to release the bound beauty until she hears about the guard's latest screenplay. In the last the two film critics of the "Sneaky Previews" TV show have a lovely bound and gagged brunette as their unwilling guest.
