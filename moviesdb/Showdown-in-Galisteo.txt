Showdown in Galisteo

 A Western-genre short film about a group of women who have to take charge of their town when a 'hostage' situation occurs, while the men of the town are all out with a posse searching for cattle rustlers. The 'women of the saloon' have to enlist their enemies, the Women of the Temperance Union' in order to bring justice back to the town of Galisteo. Campy satire of Western movie cliches.
