Surf and Sound

 A band of little mice have come out to play and to enjoy the pleasures offered at the seashore. But, just as sure as this is a Noveltoon, the villainous Katnip the Kat shows up with intent of making certain no mouse, mice or meece in the area enjoys anything. Where, or where, is Herman the Mouse when he is needed? Could that be him coming up the beach? It could.
