Tucked and Folded Away

 Ryan and Stacie just want a simple life. They would like nothing more than to settle into a home and start a family. Unfortunately, at their young age, their friends and family expect them to put things off, go to school and take nothing seriously until they are considered ready. As an evening of dinner and a movie draws to a close, a series of unusual events launch the pair onto a strange path that may just lead to exactly what they are looking for.
