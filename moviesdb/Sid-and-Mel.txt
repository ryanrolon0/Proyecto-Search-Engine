Sid and Mel

 A dark farce about morality, dismemberment, dogs, Christmas, chicken wings, and friendship. Sid and Mel are seedy, though lovable petty criminals out for a Christmas-eve snack when they stumble into what only seems like an abandoned restaurant. Their friendship is tested as the situation takes dark and absurd turns.
