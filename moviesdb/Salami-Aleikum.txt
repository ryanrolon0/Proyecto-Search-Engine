Salami Aleikum

 To save the family's butchery from insolvency smallish, sensitive Mohsen heads to Poland to buy low-priced sheep. On his way he lands somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Eastern Germany and falls in love with former shot-putter Ana. The villagers assume Mohsen to be a scion of a Persian textile dynasty who may save the village. Mohsen becomes more and more en vogue until his father appears.
