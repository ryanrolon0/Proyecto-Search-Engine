The Sword in the Stone

 Arthur (aka Wart) is a young boy who aspires to be a knight's squire. On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, a powerful but amnesiac wizard who has plans for Wart beyond mere squiredom. He starts by trying to give Wart an education (whatever that is), believing that once one has an education, one can go anywhere. Needless to say, it doesn't quite work out that way. Wart, a measly servant knave, dreams of becoming a knight but is barely certain he may act as castle lord Sir Ector's even ruder son Kay's squire. Then the sorcerer Merlin and his grumpy speaking owl Archimedes invite themselves and move into a dilapidated tower. Merlin, who can magically access the future, accepts the challenge to prepare Wart for a grand future. So he gives the squirt dangerous lessons by transforming themselves into animals to learn the mental skills fitting a knight and a ruler. For the magic sword in the stone, which can confer the kingdom of all England, then still divided, couldn't be withdrawn for years, and now a tournament in London is to designate a contender instead. Kay is going to compete, but the fat klutz stands no chance.
