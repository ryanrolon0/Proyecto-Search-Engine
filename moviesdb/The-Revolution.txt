The Revolution

 Set in an unspecified time and place, an underground political group stages a revolution via pirate radio, secret code and guerrilla tactics. The group members, taking alter egos of 20th century revolutionary figures, disseminate their message through manifesto, reportage of current events and acts against authority in a never-ending cycle of trial and error.
