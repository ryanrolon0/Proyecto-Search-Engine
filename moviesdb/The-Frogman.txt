The Frogman

 The story is about a Navy Seal and his son who wants to follow in his foot steps, but he wants his son to go to college. The son enlists the father to help him train for the Seals program, but instead of really helping him, he tries to break him and make him quit. The Frogman centers around Jimmy (Mike Ball) and his Navy SEAL father, James (Tim Moran). Jimmy yearns for an emotional connection with his father, something he's never had. In trying to obtain this acceptance and connection, Jimmy plans to enlist in the BUD/S Training program, hoping this will finally bring him and his father closer together. Though James is an accomplished SEAL, he doesn't want Jimmy to experience the same life he did -- never being around for his family. James wants Jimmy to accept his college scholarship and forget about joining the SEALs. This motivates Jimmy even more. Jimmy enlists his father to help him prepare for the SEAL training, and James believe this is the best way to make Jimmy realize he isn't cut out for the SEAL teams. It becomes a battle of wills to see who will outlast the other. Will Jimmy prove to his father he is worthy of becoming a SEAL, or will James finally break his son and make him realize the SEAL life isn't for him?
