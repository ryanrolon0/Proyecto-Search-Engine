The Last Stagecoach West

 The coming of the railroad to Cedar City spells the end of the stagecoach as the government gives the mail contract to the fastest means of delivery. McCord loses the stagecoach line gambling with the new buyer, but has enough hidden money to buy a ranch and some cattle. To make more money, he starts a gang to rob the railroad, express offices and steal cattle. But the railroads send out special agent Cameron to end his reign of violence. Rand McCord's stagecoach loses a race with the C&P Transcontinental Railroad,and he loses his government mail contracts and his stageline fails. He loses what little he has left in a poker game. McCord, accompanied by his assistant Steve Margolies, meets notorious outlaw Park Ketchum, and is surprised to learn that Margolies and Park are old friends, both having ridden with Quantrill's Raiders during the Civil War. Shorty after Margolies accepts the foreman's job on McCord's new ranch, a series of train robberies takes place. The Railroad Protective Association sends Bill Cameron, their top operative, to investigate the robberies. Cameron arrives posing as a patent medicine salesman. It takes him a while to figure out how the broke-and-busted McCord managed to buy a large cattle ranch.
