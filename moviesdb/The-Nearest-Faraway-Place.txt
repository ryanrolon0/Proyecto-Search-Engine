The Nearest Faraway Place

 A black-comedy about a couple and their 'third wheel' friend who engage in the black-market industry of stealing pure-bred dogs in order to support their drug addictions. A string of bad luck during dognappings, followed by increasing withdrawl symptoms, complicate matters. Desperate times call for desperate measures as these star-crossed addicts, on the brink of insanity, try to devise methods to attain their much needed supplies.
