Satyritown

 This short art film is about an experience in a quirky in town neighborhood Cabbagetown Once an insular, poor but proud mill village of Appalachian transplants, the neighborhood offered sanctuary to bohemians in the 1970s. The nineties wave of in town gentrification was not able to stamp out Cabbagetown's offbeat ness. The community is filled with eccentric artisans, musicians and other artist types. The community authentic and complex is filled with the creative, intelligent, and curious. People in Cabbagetown are known as the Jester, the King, Doc, the Reverend and the Bike Doctor. A strong proud sense of community is exhibited. People still sit on their porches together, talk, feud, and help one another. They party and they share food. The town is a world that imitates fantasy inside and outside of the homes. The film opens amongst the Krog Street tunnel with philosophical graffiti. Filmed with an old fashioned super 8, the camera captures the nubby, grainy, rich layered textures of the community. Textures and colors are intensified. The film takes on its own form, having a sensual as well as a spiritual feeling to it. The film offers viewers an experience; it invites the viewer to float through such as the camera does. There is a magical and surreal feeling to crossing through the tunnel into this town. Scenes of a dog in a window, sheets blowing in the wind become an introduction to a place, its people and their magical worlds they have built in their homes.
