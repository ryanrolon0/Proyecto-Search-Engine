Siamese Connection

 Mary and Aurora are Siamese twins that were separated at birth. As young adults they are closer to each other than most identical twins. Their minds are psychically linked in such a way that when one of them feels a strong emotion or sensation, the other feels it just as much. When Mary decides leave home to go far away for medical school, Aurora sees tragedy in her sister's future. Aurora must do all that she can to keep her twin from leaving, but will she be able to convince Mary before its too late?
