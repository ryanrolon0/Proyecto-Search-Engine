The Hat

 The nameless central character of "The Hat" is a down trodden office worker barely surviving within a bleak work environment. Just when he has reached his breaking point, he has a vision of a mysterious penguin that inspires him to improve his situation by making minor, even trivial, changes to his environment. When his lamp flickers out leaving him in a colorless cubical once again, its as though his environment is fighting back in an attempt to crush his spirits once more. By this time, however, the seeds of revolution have already been sown and he smashes through the very wall that confines him to his grim existence. In doing this he reveals the hope of a greater and brighter world beyond.
