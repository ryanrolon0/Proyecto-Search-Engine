The Fire-Trap

 Bill Farnsworth, an investigator for an insurance company that writes large fire-insurance polices for factories and warehouses, has his car wrecked due to the road-hog driving of Betty. This leads to a romance which is hampered by the activities of her guardian-uncle,R.A. Rawson, who has squandered her inherited fortune, and Bill's boss, Cedric McIntyre. The latter has over-valued the inventory of Rawson's perfume factory and warehouse, and both stand to gain a lot of money when it burns down. Uncle has also promised Betty's hand-in-marriage to McIntyre. Betty is unaware of this arrangement.
