Rough Riders of Durango

 Marshal "Rocky" Lane ('Allan Lane (I)' (qv)) comes to the aid of Sheriff Bill Walters ('Ross Ford' (qv)) who is having a hard time trying to save the local farmers and ranchers from raids and hi-jackings. With Banker Johnson ('Hal Price' (qv)) about to foreclose on all their ranches and farms, the sheriff arranges for them to get a $40,000 advance on their next grain shipment so that they can pay off their notes at the bank. But the town's supposedly honest and harmless harness maker, John Blake ('Steve Darrell' (qv)), who is the brains behind the gang, has the messenger, Jim Carter ('Russ Whiteman' (qv) killed and the money stolen.
