Under Strange Flags

 In 1914 Mexico, the revolution, led by Pancho Villa, is preventing many Americans from getting their mined-in-Mexico silver across the American border. Tom Kenyon, American manager of the deVargas mine, La Paloma, and his assistant, Tequila, try yo send a shipment through the barricaded lines of both Villa and renegade-army General Barranca. The latter's men get into a skirmish with Villa's forces, and, while they fight it out, Tom hides the silver. Denny deVargas, unknown to his family and to Tom, has joined forces with the outlaw Barrance and has promised to get the silver shipment for him. Denny is captured and imprisoned by Villa. Tom, in his effort to rescue the worthless Denney, is caught by Captain Morales, a Villa aide, who is conspiring against his leader. Morales frees Denny to continue his services for Barranca, and Tom is put in Denny's cell. Sentenced to a firing-squad death by Villa, Tom is released following an appeal by his mother. He is then captured by Barranca's men but is rescued through Tequila's efforts. Tom, who can't seem to avoid anybody, is then embroiled anew with attackers sent by Morales. Somehow, Tom saves the silver and rides to the waiting arms of Dolores de Vargas, his sweetheart. It's 1914 in Mexico and Tom Kenyon is trying to safely transport a load of silver.
