Suva, Pride of Fiji

 James A. FitzPatrick takes a tour of the Fiji Islands. The short depicts the different types on natives that inhabit the islands, and shows villages that have not been changed in architecture for centuries. There are ceremonial dances, and FitzPatrick politically-correctly describes the rule of the islands under the British government.
