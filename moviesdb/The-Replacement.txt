The Replacement

 Uncompromising moorland, daybreak, a couple narrowly avoid hitting something on the road. Forced to stop and investigate they come face to face with a terrified, naked and blood-soaked woman. Pleading for help, she insists that something is tracking her. She collapses; the couple place her in the car and in doing so seal their fate. They are forced into a full on pursuit, which ultimately leads to their horrific and sustained deaths.
