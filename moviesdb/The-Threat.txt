The Threat

 The Threat is a short film shot in New Orleans, Louisiana. It's about a corporation called Omega Corp which is under heavy attack by the AMA and the FDA for one of their new health products which has been curing people. Apparently the AMA and the FDA have one goal in mind and that is to keep people sick & make as much money possible while doing so, only Sarah and her crew see things differently...
