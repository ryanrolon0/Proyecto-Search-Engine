The Power of Authority

 A painter is at work on a scaffold when a young officer strolls along with his best girl. A spot of paint falls on the officer's uniform and he at once orders a sentry to call the man down. The sentry prods the man with his bayonet, and the pot of paint is overturned, the contents falling completely over the officer.
