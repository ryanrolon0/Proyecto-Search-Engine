The Keepers of Pea Island

 On October 11, 1896, the first all black manned crew station of the US Lifesaving Service at Pea Island, N.C. accomplished one of the most daring rescues from the sea ever recorded. Years later, this organization became know as the United States Coast Guard. This is also the story of the incidents that lead up to the staffing of the station with it's all black lifesaving staff and the formation of the core lifesaving procedures by it's leader, also a black man.
