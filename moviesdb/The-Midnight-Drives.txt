The Midnight Drives

 Andy (Colt), a divorcee who has custody of his two young children over a winter half term, chooses to travel with them to Cornwall in an attempt to recapture the magic of his own childhood holidays. Divorce has left Andy in a lonely place, estranged from his kids, frustrated by his inability to communicate, and determined not to waste a single precious minute of his long-awaited holiday; but as the week wears on, the pressures begin to mount. Despite Andy's best efforts, the holiday slides inexorably towards disaster, thanks to a combination of eccentric guesthouse owners, doomed day-trips, a mysteriously elusive maze and the vagaries of the Cornish weather. But while the days are dogged by disaster, at night Andy and his kids discover a new sense of connection through a series of spontaneous, dreamlike excursions they come to call The Midnight Drives...
