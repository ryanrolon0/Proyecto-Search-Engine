Sounds Like a Revolution

 Documents the rise of a new generation of activist musicians who are living proof that music is a powerful tool in the ongoing struggle for social change. From the 'Dixie Chicks' (qv) to 'Michael Franti' (qv) to the punk band 'Anti-Flag' (qv), artists across the musical spectrum recount their motivations and struggles over the last decade, in a post-9/11 world where dissent has been silenced and censorship is commonplace. No ordinary music doc, this inspiring rockumentary draws on the power of music and insights of artists to help us understand our world and find the courage to speak out about issues that concern us all.
