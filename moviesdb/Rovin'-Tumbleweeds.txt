Rovin' Tumbleweeds

 A flood has wiped out the ranchers. Congressman Fuller was against the Flood Control bill so Gene runs against him in the next election and wins. Gene goes to Washington but has no success in passing the bill as Holloway is using his influence to block it. Then just as Gene returns home another disastrous flood hits. Because of floods in the Green River Valley, Gene Autry and the other ranchers migrate to another section, in this Republic homage to Columbia's "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington", but low wages and local-ranchers' resentment against them cause trouble. Gene, in an effort to support and help his friends, gets a job singing on the radio. Opposition to Congressman Fuller, who failed to get a necessary flood-control bill passed, serves as a springboard for Steve Holloway to get Gene elected to the office, although Gene is unaware that his backer also opposed the bill. Gene is stymied in Washington and it is not until he returns home and another flood rages that Holloway sees the light, and agrees to make restitution and use his political influence to help pass the flood-control bill.
