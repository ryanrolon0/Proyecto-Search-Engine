Reflections on a Crime

 In a series of flashbacks and confessional conversations with her prison guard, Regina seeks to understand her life in her final hours on death row before she is sent to the electric chair for the murder of her husband. A psychological drama about the nature of guilt. As she tells her story, we witness more than one version of the murder. Was it poison, a gun shot, or an accident? Did she intend to murder him, or only stumble on it? This film requires the audience to consider the meaning of remorse, and love. Seven years ago, Regina (Mimi Rogers) was tried for the death. On the night before she becomes the first woman in over 40 years to be executed in a federal penitentiary, she befriends the lone, curious prison guard Colin Reeves (Billy Zane), who has been assigned to watch over her. By telling Regina's story through flashbacks interwoven with her present situation, the film helps us understand this woman in a unique, disturbing and sympathetic way. Regina ha ucciso il marito ed e stata condannata a morte. Il giorno precedente l'esecuzione, la donna si trova in cella con il guardiano Colin, al quale decide di raccontare la sua storia, per trascorrere il tempo senza pensare al giorno dopo. Afferma di aver ucciso il coniuge per evitargli il divorzio, che lo avrebbe addolorato enormemente. Il secondino la ascolta quasi incredulo, ma continuando ad ascoltarla si rende conto che la faccenda non era così semplice come sembrava.
