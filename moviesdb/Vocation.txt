Vocation

 A young Jewish Groom runs away from his wedding day, leaving his Bride and her controlling Father behind. He takes shelter in a Catholic Church, figuring it to be the last place anyone will look. What he doesn't expect to find is words of wisdom from a friendly Catholic priest who makes him realise what is important to him.
