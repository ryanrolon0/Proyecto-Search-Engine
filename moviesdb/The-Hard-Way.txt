The Hard Way

 Nick Lang is a famous actor, well know for his action movies. For the next film he needs the proper motivation and inspiration for his roll. Thus he teams up with the reluctant N.Y. cop John Moss. Not only does he have to put up with Nick who is laborious and out of touch with realities, but he also has to catch a cold-blooded murderer. Hollywood star Nick Lang is after a role as a movie cop, and to get background pulls strings to get seconded to a New York detective for a fortnight. Lt. John Moss is less than overjoyed by his new partner who is soon cramping his rough streetwise style. But when it comes to getting on with the lovely Susan the lieutenant could do a lot worse than listen to Nick's advice.
