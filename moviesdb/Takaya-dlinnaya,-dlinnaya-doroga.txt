Takaya dlinnaya, dlinnaya doroga

 A man is traveling all over the world and making monuments to victims of all wars, because he is unable to find his own son, who was lost in the WWII. The son's name was found in records of casualties, but without the location of son's grave. So the father took on a mission of making many, many monuments... That is how the father's life turned into such a long, long road.
