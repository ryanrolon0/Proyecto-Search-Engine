Ticked

 Angel (16), a young Latino, is caught between life in the gang and his taboo friendship with Jaime (17), African-American. Pressure mounts when his gangster friend Raul (16) warms up his interest in Angel's sister Maria (15) who's dating Jamie. Angel (16), a young Latino, lives with his indifferent father in the Ramona Gardens Projects of East Los Angeles. He quit school because he thinks he doesn't learn anything useful there. Instead, he spends his time playing video games and hanging around with his homeboy Raul (16) and other gangsters. Angel met Jaime (17), African-American, during a Fire Service Youth Training a couple years back and they've been good buddies ever since. Jaime and Angel's sister Maria (15) developed a hearty crush on each other and the two started dating. Not only hurt by Maria's rejection but because of territorial claims and racism generally inherent in the local gang, Raul pushes Angel to cut his ties with Jaime. Torn at first about what to defend, Angel soon seems to have made a decision for himself when events rapidly unfold.
