Rompe el día

 'At Day Breaks' follows the story of a Spanish Theater and Dance company and specially of Paquita Santana, its main dancer, as they toured Mediterranean Middle East and Euroipe in the 1970's and 80's. Not palatable for the Spain's society during the Franco era, this bunch of wild and willful women toured their variety show to great acclaim in cities such as Beirut, Damascus and Athens the extreme, only pausing for thought at the end of their day, before bedtime, as the new ºday was dawning.
