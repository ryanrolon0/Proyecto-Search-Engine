Soul's Midnight

 Soul's Midnight is a present day vampire horror based on a historic cult who delves into ancient rituals revolving around the legend of St. George. The Eve of St. George is upon them and they must find the perfect sacrifice, a child with an untainted ancestry to St George, to resurrect their ancient leader. In 1975, a pregnant woman escapes alone from a dangerous sect that worships St. George in Guthrie, Texas, protected by her husband that shoots against the masked members. Thirty years later, her son Charles Milford receives his will and a letter calling him for the funeral of his father, and he travels with his pregnant wife Alicia back to Guthrie. They lodge in a fancy hotel owned by Simon and they are introduced to his mistress Iris in the Eve of St Geoge Festival. Sooner they discover that Charles is a descendant of St. George and the blood of his unborn baby is necessary to resurrect the leader of a vampire community.
