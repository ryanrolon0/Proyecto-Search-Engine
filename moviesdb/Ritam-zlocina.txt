 A single teacher allows a stranger to share his home with him before it is to be torn down by developers. The stranger has a fascination with statistics, and claims he can predict crimes based on statistical analyses. Intrigued by this talent, the teacher tells a married, female friend that the man seems to have done what he claims. Then the numbers show that there is a slip-up and a murder that was supposed to have occurred, did not. The stranger is adamant that a balance has to be achieved or the whole town will suffer - and he leaves.
