UseD

 USED is action thriller driven by a recently reformed young woman Evelyn(Eve) James who is struggling to regain control of her life in the midst of complete societal chaos. USED examines the scenario of what could happen if economic conditions continues to decline which in effect, weakens the structures that governs good behavior within our society. For example, what if we were forced to minimize the amount of policing that's necessary to maintain in an effort to cut back on government spending. Furthermore, what would happen if the solution to control the booming prison population and ease the burden on tax payers is to release violent and non-violent felons alike, the minute they become eligible for parole. Lastly, what actions will decent, hardworking civilians take in order to secure their safety and prosperity. This is where the 2nd Amendment comes in to play resulting in a vigilante society.
