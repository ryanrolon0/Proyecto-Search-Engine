Slim Pickings

 A forlorn looking creature on a shabby looking planet is down to its last food potted plant that's been a friend for a long time. While the creature is out foraging, unsuccessfully, for food, the plant produces a surprise that falls just out of sight. The creature returns, convinced the plant is its last available food. Will it notice the surprise in time?
