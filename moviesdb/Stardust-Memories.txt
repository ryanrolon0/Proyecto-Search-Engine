Stardust Memories

 Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker, attends a festival conducted to honor his work. During the course of the weekend he reconsiders his cinematic accomplishments as well as his past relationships. A director named Sandy Bates is a man who simply doesn't want to make goofball comedies anymore, and it seems that the comedies are all that society wants from him. He's unhappy at the moment because his first "serious" film isn't well received by the public. He decides to stay a weekend at a hotel to reflect upon his life, body of work, and relationships of the past while a festival showcasing his films is occurring. Meanwhile, he encounters groups of his fans who ask for autographs, compliment him on his "early funnies", his style of filmmaking, and he encounters a beautiful woman named Dorrie, with whom he falls in love.
