The Texas Kid

 Marshals Nevada and Sandy are after Scully and his gang who have been robbing stage-coaches. The Texas Kid is part of the gang and Sandy thinks he is bad but Nevada knows him and thinks he may be good. U.S. Marshals "Nevada Jack" McKenzie and "Sandy" Hopkins meet on the way to uncovering the outlaws who robbed the stagecoach from National City carrying the rancher's payrolls, and killed the man who ran the Rockbend Trading Post. Nancy Drew, daughter of the slain man, has sold half-interest to Naylor, a respected citizen but in reality the leader of the Scully gang, which is committing the robberies. The insurance company refuses to assume the risk of covering the ranchers, and Naylor is acquiring their property through liens. MacLaine, also known as The Texas Kid, searching for his father's killer, has joined the Scully gang but leaves after shooting a gang member responsible for his father's murder. Arriving in Rockbend, MacLaine begins a romance with Nancy and Naylor, wanting to keep him in the gang, sells him half-interest in the trading post. "Nevada" and "Sandy" come to the post and "Nevada," who knew MacLaine and his father, wants to believe the Kid has gone straight. The Kid is trying to do just that but is forced into situations by Naylor that make it appear other wise.
