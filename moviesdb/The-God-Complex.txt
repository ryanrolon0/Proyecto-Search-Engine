The God Complex

 The God Complex is a comedy re-telling of the silliest stories in the Bible. We make them just a bit sillier. All your favorite characters are there; God, God's girlfriend Barb, Gay Joseph, Virgin Mary, Virgin Mary's Gynecologist, Noah and his wife Yessah, their sons Ham, Swiss and Rye, Adam and Eve and Pete, Moses, the tested and tormented Job, and of course - Jesus. The film covers the world from "in the beginning" to today, where God and Jesus walk among us disguised as a mild mannered employees for a great metropolitan toy manufacturer.
