The Order to Come

 Years pass in seconds and memory turns to dust as Johnny Crump and DJ Rubbish present their vision of The Order To Come... The Order To Come sets out to challenge the way we engage with sound and image. Chopped-down scraps of audio are mashed together to create interest through a tone of indifference using ambiguous samples and dejected lyrics. Screen images use this audio as a creative starting point, following its attitude and rhythm to create a visual collage that is both evocative and provocative and spans generations and continents. Viewers enter a sensory dream world where nothing is certain and the barely visible is free to create meaning of its own. The intensity of the music is compounded by the hypnotic repetitious imagery.
