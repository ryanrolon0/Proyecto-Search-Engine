Valley Maker

 After completing construction of his wooden raft Kafer travels 1600 miles down the Mississippi River from Prescott, Wisconsin to New Orleans. Capturing Middle America's back waters, Valley Maker combines documentary and personal travelogue. The film is a chronological trip of living postcards compiled of forgotten places and present life on the big river.
