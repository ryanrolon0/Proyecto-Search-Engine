 Vivi's boyfriend needs money, and he persuades her to pose for some photographs which will net him the cash he needs. She is unaccountably disgusted to discover that the photos have been sold to a girlie magazine, and that she was the centerfold attraction. When the obscene calls and letters get to be too much for her, she takes off for parts unknown. She is followed by a man who has long admired her. After seeing her centerfold, he imagines that she is a woman of easy virtue.
