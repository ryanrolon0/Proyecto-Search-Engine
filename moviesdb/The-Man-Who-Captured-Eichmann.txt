The Man Who Captured Eichmann

 In 1960, the Israeli Secret Service learns that former SS-Lietuenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann, who was one of the key figures in the Jewish holocaust of World War II, is living under the assumed name Ricardo Clement in Argentina. The film thus explores the Isreali effort to capture Eichmann, as seen from the perspective of the leading agent of the project, as well as giving focus to Eichmann's own explanations as to the crimes he commited. In the opening scene, cows are herded onto a cattle car, and the train begins its trip; in the next scene, former Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann and his young son watch from a window of their Buenos Aires home as the train passes. Thus the underlying theme of the movie is revealed Holocaust. This is a tense reenactment of the capture of Eichmann, posing as Ricardo Klement, by the Israeli Mossad in Argentina in 1960.
