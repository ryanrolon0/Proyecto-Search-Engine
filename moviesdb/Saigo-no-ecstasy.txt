Saigo no ecstasy

 Withdrawn into herself AKANE gradually becomes obsessed with chat sites for people who are thinking of killing themselves. One morning a man called LUCIEN begins to post on the site and he asks Akane to commit 'double-suicide' with him. Akane agrees. Lucien orders her not to eat for three days so that they can both look beautiful when they die. Three days later Lucien calls and Akane goes to his house, only to find that Lucien is not all that he seems.
