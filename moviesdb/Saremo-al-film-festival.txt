Saremo al film festival

 Two poor young directors, without money but big fantasy, realize a short movie and hope to send it to the famous "XYZ FILM FESTIVAL". While, in a long limousine, the president of this festival, with a terrible and dirty staff, talk about what's behind a similar organization. A very wonderful and nice short about the "sharks" organizing a film festival in Italy.
