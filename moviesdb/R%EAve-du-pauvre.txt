Rêve du pauvre

 A poor ragged beggar is seen stretched upon his straw in a dilapidated attic. The scene which follows illustrates the dream of a poor hungry man. A fairy suddenly makes her appearance and with her magic wand causes the attic to change into the interior of a palatial drawing room, in the cneter of which she introduces a table laden with a sumptuous dinner. The beggar, still in his rags, is transformed into a club swell. He is visited by a charming young lady, attired in the height of fashion, who he greets and invites to partake of the dinner before him. As they seat themselves the chairs disappear from under them and the entire scene changes to that of the original scene -- the attic -- with the poor beggar kicking and rolling on the straw.
