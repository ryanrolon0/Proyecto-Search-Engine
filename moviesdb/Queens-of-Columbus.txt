Queens of Columbus

 A fast-paced documentary that explores female impersonation in a large Midwestern city. Comprised of interviews with nine female illusionists, "Queens" utilizes performance footage and excerpts from other gay-focused events, such as Ohio's largest gay pride parade and "Bat'n'Rouge", a drag queen softball game. Included are discussions of these performers' introduction to female illusion, an exploration of techniques they utilize to effect the transformation from male to female, a look at money-making and booking procedures, and an examination of their role in the gay subculture and society as a whole.
