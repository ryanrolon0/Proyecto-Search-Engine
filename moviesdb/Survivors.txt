Survivors

 The dead are rising and the city has been evacuated, but two survivors remain behind. Rita wouldn't abandon her infected husband, and Sachin refused to leave the memory of his dead wife. Now trapped in Sachin's bar, the two must find a way to survive. Willing to do anything to avoid dying alone, Rita deceives and seduces her way into Sachin's life, but soon discovers that tempting his memories is even more dangerous than what's lurking outside.
