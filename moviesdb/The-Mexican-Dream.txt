The Mexican Dream

 The Mexican Dream, is a Tragic comedy about the longings and delusions that lure so many illegal immigrants to this country. It's a fractured story about a naive, impulsive, but above all else passionate man, one who will do anything for his family, who will stop at nothing to live his dream. It is a look into one of the major social issues of the 21st century, immigration. Ajileo journeys from his home in Zapotitlan de Salinas, a village in southern Mexico, makes a perilous border crossing through the desert, and comes to Hollywood, where everything and nothing is as he dreamed it would be. Ajileo Barajas, a movie star wannabe, loaded with madness and the anxiety to give his family a better life, dresses up as a woman and decides to cross the border illegally, convinced that if he ever faces the law in the worst scenario he will be treated as a lady. In his own odyssey he discovers that dreams not always come true and reality is much different from what he envisioned.
