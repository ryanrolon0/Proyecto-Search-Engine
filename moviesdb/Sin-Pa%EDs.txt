Sin País

 Nearly twenty years ago, Sam and Elida Mejia escaped Guatemala during a violent civil war and brought their one-year old son to California. They worked hard, raised a family, and lived the American dream. Two years ago, immigration agents stormed the Mejia's house and they have been fighting to stay in the U.S.A. ever since. Sin Pais (Without Country) begins two weeks before Sam and Elida are deported and the family is ripped apart. With intimate access and striking imagery, this short film explores the complexities of the Mejia's new reality of a separated family--parents without their children, and children without their parents.
