Storm Over Bengal

 Rahman Khan (Douglas Dumbrille' (qv)), leader of the hill tribes, has been inciting rebellion against the British Army. Joan Latimer ('Rochelle Hudson' (qv)), recently arrived from England, is on her way to Fort Draga to marry Captain Jeffrey Allison ('Patric Knowles' (qv)), a hero in the British Army in India. Escorting Joan is Jeffrey's younger brother Neil Allison ('Richard Cromwell' (qv)), who has fallen in love with Joan, a hopeless attachment made more intense by the bitterness he feels toward his brother who has always been held up to him as a fine example to follow. Before Jeffrey and Joan can be married, Rahman Khan strikes and he is sent on a dangerous mission. He and his brother quarrel before he leaves, and Joan has told Neil that not even Jeffrey's death would change her attitude and that Neil's continued declarations of love for her are distasteful.
