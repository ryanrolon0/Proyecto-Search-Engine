Skybound

 Captain John Kent is a pilot in charge of the border patrol. Two crooks who head up a smuggling operation, Morley and his associate Faber, are trying to outwit Kent. The smugglers hope that they can influence Kent's younger brother Doug to help them, and they employ an attractive singer in an attempt to win Doug over.
