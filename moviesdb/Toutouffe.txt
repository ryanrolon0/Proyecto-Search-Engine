Toutouffe

 Shaggy and bearded from months of being stuck on a median, Toutouffe becomes frustrated while farcically rebelling against the forces against him and ultimately only succeeds at getting into dangerous situations. With the loving assistance of a wise old friend, he conquers his fears and gains the perspective necessary to continue his journey.
