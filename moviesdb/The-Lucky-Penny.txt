The Lucky Penny

 "The Lucky Penny" is a 15-minute, B&W, silent, comedy short. The story is of a man named 'Luckless' who finds a lucky penny. The penny turns out to be anything but lucky as Luckless spends the rest of his day getting in and out of trouble, chased by the cops, and narrowly avoiding one calamity after another. The movie is filled with slapstick comedy, stunts, and sight gags reminiscent of the Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies from the 1920s.
