The Handover

 Paul is a single dad who loves spending time with his daughter Katy, but handing her back at the end of the weekend reminds him of everything he has lost - his family, his home and Helen, the love of his life. In the course of one fateful evening, in the aftermath of returning Katy to her mother, Paul seizes an opportunity for one last moment of intimacy with Helen. But as he soon discovers, his act of transgression comes with a price.
