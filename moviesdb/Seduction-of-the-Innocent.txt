Seduction of the Innocent

 Jeanette, a pretty high school student, is looking for "kicks." She starts hanging out with a wild crowd, and begins popping "bennies, uppers" and other pills. Soon she graduates from barbiturates to (gasp!) marijuana, which of course means that she is immediately turned into a heroin addict. Pretty soon Jeanette is stealing to feed her marijuana and heroin habits, then descends even further, and becomes a streetwalker.
