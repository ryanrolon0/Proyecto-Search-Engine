The 20 Little Piggy Banks

 Contestants compete to win grand prizes hidden in personalized banks. Players aim to accumulate as many "piggies" as possible by answering general knowledge questions. In the endgame all remaining piggies will be smashed to pieces to reveal the prizes. Along the way, there is the chance that contestants could leave empty-handed if they stumble across a black coin.
