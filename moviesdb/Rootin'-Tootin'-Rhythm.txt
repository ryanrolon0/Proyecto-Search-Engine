Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm

 Gene and Frog, out to stop a bunch of cattle rustlers, assume the identities of what they believe to be dead bandits, which soon gets them in big trouble. Chasing rustlers, Gene and Frog find that two of them have killed two deputies and changed clothes with them. Hoping to find the gang leader they change into the outlaw's clothes. This puts them on the right track when the big boss Stafford saves them from a posse. But the two outlaws now posing as Deputies arrive and Gene and Frog soon find themselves prisoners.
