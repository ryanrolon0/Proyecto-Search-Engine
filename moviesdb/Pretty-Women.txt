Pretty Women

 This is a 16mm short made for "Soundies" distribution in 1944 and re-issued by Sack Amusements, in 16mm, in 1949 to theatres. It features San Antonio singer/band leader ('Red River Dave' (qv)) (Dave McEnery) and his Red River Boys band as soldiers, in a barracks setting, talking and singing about what they are going to do after they are discharged, which boils down to finding some pretty women. The songs dissolve into settings involving plenty of pretty women wearing bathing suits and dressing gowns designed to display their attributes, of which they have many and they are well displayed, especially when ('Ann Parker (II)' (qv)) sings her song, "He's My Pin-up Boy." The other songs are by McEnery and the band and are; "Oh, Susanna," "Every Saturday Night" and "There Are Loads of Pretty Women in This World."
