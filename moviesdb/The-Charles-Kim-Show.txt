The Charles Kim Show

 What happens when a quirky Korean American Comedian decides to put on his own television show? With a mix bag of skits that poke fun at stereotypes, a reluctant side kick, and an even more reluctant guest star, we get a peek into the irreverent mind of Charles Kim. Its a little Chapelle with a side of Kimchi... Its a little South Park painted Yellow... Welcome to the Charles Kim Show!
