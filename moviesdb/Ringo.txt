Ringo

 Lorne (Roy Rogers) finds Ringo (John Wayne) clinging to life with a bullet in the back. He saves the wounded stranger's life, but the new friendship is almost immediately tested when the embittered Ringo starts practicing his quick draw the moment he's back on his feet. Ringo and Lorne part ways Lorne becomes a lawman, Ringo becomes the gun slinging scourge of the West. Inevitably Ringo's crime spree intersects Lorne's jurisdiction, and duty requires the two former amigos face off in a show-down. But rather than kill the man who saved his life, Ringo allows himself to be bushwhacked by the pursuing posse. Heartbroken over his friend's suicidal sacrifice and his own ill-deserved reputation as the man who stopped Ringo, Lorne turns his back on the law to pick up the murderous mayhem where Ringo left off.
