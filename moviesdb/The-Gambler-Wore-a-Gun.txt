The Gambler Wore a Gun

 The professional gambler Case Silverthorn wants to quit and retire to a small ranch in Marlpine he bought recently. On the way there he saves the Sheriff's life, who got into an ambush. However another man is dead - Will Donovan, from whom he bought the ranch! Neither the Sheriff nor Donovan's children know about the sale. So Case has to switch back to his former profession, while he tries to clarify the situation. He comes across a group of cattle thieves. Case Silverhorn ('Jim Davis (I)' (qv)), a professional gambler, purchases a ranch through the mail, but the man he buys it from is murdered before the title-deed can be recorded. THe seller's children, Jud ('Don Dorrell' (qv)) and Sharon Donovan('Merry Anders' (qv))have no knowledge of the transaction and will not vacate the ranch. Taking a job ate the local saloon, Case discovers that rustlers, unknown to the Donovans, are using the ranch-lands to hide the stolen cattle. Jud learns of the operation and is killed by the gang, and Case is framed for the murder. (An uncredited remake of about five different B-westerns of the 1930s and 40s, which is likely the reason that the prolific Orville Hampton signed his screenplay as Owen Harris.)
