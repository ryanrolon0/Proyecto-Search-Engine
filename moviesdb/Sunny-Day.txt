Sunny Day

 Sunny Day is a dark comedy that explores a day in the life of Trevor Reynolds, a successful real estate agent who has everything a young man could want - looks, money prestige, women - everything but happiness, that is. In an effort to find this so called happiness, Trevor attempts to make a positive change in himself and the world around him. There's just one problem always the same for Trevor whose shallow, self-absorbed outlook makes any change nearly impossible.
