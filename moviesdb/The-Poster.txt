The Poster

 Anthony (Justin Toon) is a mild-mannered man, quiet and withdrawn; he immerses himself in his own fantasy world of comics. Working at his dream job, the local comic book store, Anthony endures the constant bullying of his boss Chett (William C. Cothron). While emptying the trash in the alley behind the store, Anthony sees a mysterious poster on the wall. It unrolls, revealing a world beyond Anthony's comic book imagination. Over the next few hours he is immersed in a situation he thought existed only in his comics. Anthony must race against time and himself if he is to survive the night, let alone exist the next morning.
