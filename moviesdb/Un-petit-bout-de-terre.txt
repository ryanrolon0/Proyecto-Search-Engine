Un petit bout de terre

 A portrait of the crisis that's striking small wine growers and producers in southern France. It's not a nostalgic look on what might be lost but an optimistic approach on what can be saved. Family, tradition, food and wine combined with generational conflicts within a small town give a glimpse of this culture, a sense of a place very particular in this globalized and modern world.
