The Devil's Brigade

 During World War II a special fighting unit is formed combining a crack Canadian outfit and a conglomeration of US Army misfits previously serving time in military jails. After an initial period of conflict between the two groups, their enmity turns to respect and friendship and the unit is sent Italy to attempt a dangerous mission which has heretofore been considered impossible to successfully complete. A fictionalized account of the First Special Service Force, the joint Canada-US World War II commando group under the command of Col. Robert T. Frederick. The Canadians are the best that the Canadian army has to offer spit and polish, multi-skilled and all experienced soldiers. The Americans are the dregs of the US Army discipline. Over time, Frederick forges a unified, highly competent fighting force. Initially trained for a commando operation in Norway, Frederick has to move quickly to keep the unit together after the operation is canceled. They are sent to Italy where they distinguished themselves in numerous battles.
