Vrykolak Empire

 'Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.' In this life and the next... Set in the cosmopolitan city of Geneva, this story reveals a sinister empire of ghosts who have arisen from a corruption of Alchemy. Their goal is to drain the life energy of humanity into their dark world. They are the Vrykolak. One Vrykolak stumbles across 'The Flower of Life' and dares to defy the Vrykolak Lord by freeing himself from the chains that bind him to his kin.
