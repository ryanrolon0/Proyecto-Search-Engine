Raise the Titanic

 A group of Americans are interested in raising the ill-fated Ocean liner Titanic. One of the team members finds out the Russians also have plans to raise the ship from its watery grave. Why all the interest ? A rare mineral on board could be used to power a sound beam that will knock any missile out of the air when entering us airspace. The American military have a experimental defense system that requires an extremely rare mineral in order to work. Investigations prove that the only known source of this mineral is in the Soviet Union, but it is known that around the turn of the century a miner exported some of the mineral. Hopes are dashed when it is learned that he transported the mineral about the Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank without a trace. But perhaps the Titanic can be salvaged....
