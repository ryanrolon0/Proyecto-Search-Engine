The Starfish Principle

 The western world spends a considerable amount of time and money raising support for third world and developing countries, such as South Africa's townships yet very little is known about how this is implemented at a grass roots level. The Starfish Principle meets the individuals working with the streets, hospitals and orphanages where they explain the difficulties - and successes - they have in making a difference to this struggling community.
