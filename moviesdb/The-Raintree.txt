The Raintree

 When a former motocross racer is confined to a wheelchair after a car accident, he finds himself in the thick of a family crisis - the bank is about to foreclose on his mother's home and nobody seems able to help. Anxious to leave and start a new life, Paul must find a way out. The only thing standing in his way is his sister, who knows that Paul is hiding his disability checks from the family.
