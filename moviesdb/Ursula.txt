Ursula

 Aimless Mårten, almost thirty, spends his days in an unspecified hospital job and his nights around Helsinki's bars. He meets edgy and distant Ursula who still goes to high school, yet has a young son whom she pretty much ignores. Mårten and Ursula drift into a get-rich scheme concocted by Mårten's eccentric friend Harri, involving cocaine smuggling and taking the trio to Copenhagen. Bad idea.
