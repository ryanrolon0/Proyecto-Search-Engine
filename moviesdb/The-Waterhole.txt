The Waterhole

 At the end of their college years, MILLER finds that he and his college buddies are growing apart as they choose different paths into the future. They are regulars at MURPHY's, a popular watering hole of choice, where friends / roommates, MILLER and JIM, meet with their buddies and are free to vent, decompress and talk about life.
