Pride of the Bowery

 Danny, managing boxer Mugs, books him into a Civilian Conservation Corps camp for training. Mugs' arrogant manner soon alienates him from the other boys. When one boy, Willie, announces that he needs money for his ill mother, Mugs enters a boxing tournament in town. When Mugs loses, the boy resorts to robbing the camp safe. Mugs is accused, but Danny clears him by capturing Willie.
