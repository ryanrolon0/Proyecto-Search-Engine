Prayers from Pelham

 Aaron returns to his hometown to find his ailing Aunt Enid only has a few days left. His problems escalate when the town busybody spreads the word that Enid will take prayers straight to God for anyone who asks. As the house fills with people anxious for Enid's service, Aaron is torn between controlling the situation and dealing with the loss of his Aunt. In this charmingly innocent comedy, we see that things rarely happen the way we set out and usually it's for the best.
