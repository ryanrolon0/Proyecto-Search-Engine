Round en la Sombra

 The small history of a dancer and a boxer separated by a mental wall. On a side the gymnasium and of the other the theater. A small opening in this wall - made with a tool called video- allows these beings and their disciplines to fuse creating a subtle game in which the dance and box breathe together.
