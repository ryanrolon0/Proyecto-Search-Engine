Psychic Touch

 A half hour look at psychic phenomena and how its finding its way to the mainstream. From entertainers like medium Lisa Williams, who has a hit show on Lifetime Television and broadcasts in dozens of countries where she claims to communicate with the dead, to doctors and hospitals who use intuitive healers to help the sick, this half hour examines the psychic realm and asks if it is finally finding an audience beyond the "weird" and "out there" stereotype. Isha Sesay hosts and Arwa Damon takes us on the journey inside the sixth sense.
