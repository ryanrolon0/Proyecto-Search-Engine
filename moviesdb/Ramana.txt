Ramana

 Ramanaa is a professor at National College. But he is also the head of an Anti Corruption Force, that aims to eliminate corruption from society. Members of the force kidnap the 15 most corrupt employees from every government department and then kill the most corrupt among them. While this gradually succeeds in lessening corruption in all departments, the police is left scratching their heads about the details of the group.
