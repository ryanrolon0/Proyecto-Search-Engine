Tijuana Moods

 Tijuana Moods is a documentary film that chronicles the affluent musical history of the city of Tijuana Mexico as well as the urban development of its thriving traditional downtown center during the era of early and late Jazz styles. Through a series of interviews of musicians of the era and re-enactments of lost memories is inter-played alongside images and actual footage of the urban areas. Oral histories play an important pole in the shaping of the visual tapestry of the film through Cabarets, Bars, Cafes and other urban zones of downtown Tijuana as remembered and as they currently exist. Tijuana Moods intends to re-examine historically the cultural and urban developments that began to shape a consciousness of modernity by way of its relevant movements in urban jazz, architectural modernism and a sense of utopia as felt throughout the cross modernization of the US/Mexico Border in the 1950's and 60's. +
