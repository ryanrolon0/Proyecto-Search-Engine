Ridin' Down the Trail

 Jimmy finds a dying Ranger Braden who asks him to give his money belt to his sister. When he rides into town he finds another man claiming to be Ranger Braden. When the money belt is found in Jimmy's saddle bag, the fake Marshal tries to arrest him. But Jimmy escapes and hopes a telegram to Ranger headquarters will clear him. Texas Ranger Tom Bradon is attacked by three outlaws and left for dead but gives his money belt to Jimmy Wakely before he dies, and asks him to give it to his sister Mary, when she arrives in Trail City by stagecoach. Jimmy takes the dead man to town where he finds, Lancer, a henchman for Mark Butler, posing as Bradon. But, when Jimmy attempts to expose him, Lancer claims he is his partner investigating his murder and, since Jimmy has Bradon's money-belt, accuses Jimmy of being the killer.
