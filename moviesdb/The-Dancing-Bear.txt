The Dancing Bear

 The tale of the always-hungry Dancing Bear. When his master falls asleep, the bear slips his collar and tracks the smell of honey to farmer Alfalfa's place. The two collide and the farmer gets covered with honey and the bear chases him. The bear's owner shows up to reclaim his performer. But the farmer has accidentally been covered by a bearskin and is promptly put on a leash and led away.
