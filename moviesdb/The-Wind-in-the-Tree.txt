The Wind in the Tree

 Perry, Michael, Meredith and Julie Richards are four normal children. They live in suburbia with their adopted mother, Susan. They have normal fights, they attend a normal school, and they live in a normal town. One day, however, they discover they are anything but normal. As the day unfolds, the children develop powers beyond their wildest imagination. They also realize that everything they thought they knew is not as it seems. In order to survive, the children must band together to crack the mystery of their past, discover the truth behind their adopted mother, and fend off the deadly beasts that have come to snatch them away from the life they thought they knew.
