 Lakha gets into trouble with his school-teacher after he is caught exchanging a love-letter with his girlfriend, Sukha. He is admonished by his paternal uncle, who is also the Headmaster. When his widowed mother falls ill, he goes to seek Dr. Balbir's help, when refused, he steals a suitcase, is subsequently arrested by Thanedar Khanna, tortured and beaten, and forced to sign a confession that he not only stole but also killed Balbir's assistant. He is subsequently tried in Court, found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After his discharge, he returns to seek vengeance - only to find that Balbir is now an elected and influential politician, and if he tries to harm him, he may get killed or end up in jail again.
