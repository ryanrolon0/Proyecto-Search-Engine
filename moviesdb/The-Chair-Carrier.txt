The Chair Carrier

 Sayed is a defeated human being living in the slums of old Cairo where he is constantly bombarded with government propaganda. He crosses paths with an ancient Egyptian porter carrying a throne and wondering in search of his lost king. Now Sayed wants to be seated too 'even for 5 minutes to see how it feels'. This political allegory is a study of the inherent self-imposed oppression in third world nations.
