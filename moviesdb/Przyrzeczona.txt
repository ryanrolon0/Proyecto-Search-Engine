Przyrzeczona

 Estimates indicate that in Germany each year dozens of Turkish girls and women are beaten to death by their husbands or family members. The protagonist of this documentary barely escaped the same fate. At her family's bidding, she was forced to marry in Germany at age 13. She managed to escape from her husband after a series of brutal attacks, and now she is in hiding both from the tyrannical man as well as from her family whom, according to traditional Turkish "family values," she dishonored by running away.
