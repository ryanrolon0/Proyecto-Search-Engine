Un rey para la Patagonia

 A documentary about the obsession that binds a man from the XIX Th Century, Orelie Antoine I, self proclaimed king of Patagonia and Araucanian, and Juan Fresan, a filmmaker who tries to shoot the story of the king until the end of his days. Their obsession is the reason for this film to exist.
