Raghu More

 Raghu More comes from a middle-class family in Bombay, India. He is successful in getting admitted in a decent college, where he gets to make new friends - Pannalal Patel, and Balkrishna Mani (alias Black Money). But the one he would really like to be introduced is the savvy and gorgeous and seemingly untouchable Ramona.

Ramona starts to notice him when he speaks for Sex Education during a college debate - which was unfortunately interrupted by his dad.

"Gilhey Shikwe (Wet complaints).
