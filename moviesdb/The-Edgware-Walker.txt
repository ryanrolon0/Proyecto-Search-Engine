The Edgware Walker

 This documentary looks at the town of Edgware and the legend of the Edgware Walker. No matter what the weather the Walker can always bee seen walking around the area, going through bins etc but always wearing nothing but a pair of shorts/pants and an old pair of trainers. Director Lee Kern tries to get to the root of the legend and get passed the stories where the Walker is known as a surgeon who lost his wife and also has a degenerative bone disease where, if he stops walking his bones will waste away. However when the Walker dies, Kern discovers a man driven by a commitment to his dead father.
