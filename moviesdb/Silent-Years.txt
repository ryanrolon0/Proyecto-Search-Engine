Silent Years

 Lois-Ann Yamanaka's poems, "Saturday Night at the Pahala Theater," are dramatized in a story of a high school girl's physical abuse at the hands of her uncle and sexual abuse at the hands of Jimmyboy, a graduating senior and star of the school volleyball team. Male teachers are compliant in a cycle of violence that includes beer, a length of garden hose and a Brillo pad, idolatry of sports heroes, a double standard about girls' and boys' behavior, and a Dodge Dart.
