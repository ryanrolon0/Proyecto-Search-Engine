Ultimate Cleaners

 From sewage spills, to rodent infestations, crime scenes, and crack houses, the Douglas family are the 'Ultimate Cleaners', taking on the cases that no one else can or will. This dirty family business takes former-cop Larry, his brother Matt, Matt's son Josh, Aunt Becky, and friend Patrick on a germ-infested journey that requires breathing masks and hazmats suits. The team tackles the most hazardous homes on the brink of bulldozing, and magically brings them back to life.
