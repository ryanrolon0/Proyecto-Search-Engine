Warriors of the Rainbow

 Since 1972, every week of the 4th of July, thousands of people gather in a remote national forest somewhere in the the United States to pray for world peace and to experience the viability of living in a cooperative community in harmony with the earth. 'Warriors of the Rainbow' takes the audience into the alternative universe of the Rainbow family to present an in-depth examination of the Rainbow philosophy.
