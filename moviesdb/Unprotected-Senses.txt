Unprotected Senses

 A film about the extraordinary Russian-Jewish theater director Kama Ginkas, who survived the Holocaust as a child and became one of the most respected theater directors working in the world today. Against the backdrop of modern Moscow and with commentaries by theater critic John Freedman, we are shown scenes from Ginkas's productions of the last fifteen years. This footage is interspersed with Ginkas's thoughts about life and theater and culminates with scenes from the rehearsals of his latest production, a stage adaptation of Chekhov's short story "Rothschild's Fiddle". Rehearsals were filmed in Moscow, Russia, and at the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, CT, where the world premiere of Rothschild's Fiddle took place on January 15, 2004.
