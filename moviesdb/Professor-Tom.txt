Professor Tom

 Tom, complete with mortarboard, is teaching a kitten the basics chase mice." But Jerry keeps subverting this lesson at every opportunity, adding his own phrases, like "cats and mice are chums." Eventually, Jerry gets Tom locked out of the house; he runs back in and gets slingshotted into the mailbox.
