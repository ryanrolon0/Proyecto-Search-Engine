Toys Will Be Toys

 An entry in Famous Studios' audience-participation, follow-the-bouncing-ball Scren Songs, production number X8-8. A toy shop is the locale of a tuneful nocturnal parade of toy soldiers, and all the toys (Popeye and Koko dolls excepted) join in to help the audience sing "Oh, You Beautiful Doll."
