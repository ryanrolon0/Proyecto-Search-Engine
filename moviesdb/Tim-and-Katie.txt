Tim and Katie

 It's hard enough when the girl you like is dating some jerk; it's even more upsetting when two of your friends become zombies and try to eat you and your crush. Four friends take a trip into the woods for a weekend and all is well until Chester has a curse placed upon him by a Gypsy woman, turning him, a run-of-the-mill jackass, into a bearded zombie. Is there room for romance for Tim and Katie, or will a zombie apocalypse tear them apart forever?
