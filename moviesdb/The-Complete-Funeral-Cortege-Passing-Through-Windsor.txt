The Complete Funeral Cortege Passing Through Windsor

 A magnificent film, different in many ways from those secured in London. The Royal Personages are here shown, following the coffin on foot, whilst in the rear of the procession will be noticed the Gentlemen at Arms and the Yeomen of the Guard, in their quaint but picturesque costume. A very interesting view is also obtained of the distinguished representatives of foreign nations. Altogether a most unique view of this historical procession. Many of the distinguished personages represented in this film are not shown in those taken of the London procession, owing to their having been driven direct from Victoria to Paddington without taking any part in the pageant. This is the only complete view of the Queen's Funeral Pageant taken, and is photographically perfect.
