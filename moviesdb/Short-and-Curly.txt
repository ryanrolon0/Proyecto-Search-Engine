Short and Curly

 Our friends, who are driving down the coast for a holiday, have their plans interrupted when a man, gagged and bound, jumps in their car. They are presented with a difficult choice leave the man to his inevitable fate. Their choice sets off a chain of events as the stranger is found dead and the four friends are implicated for murder. With police, mobsters, politicians, and a fruitier all after them, the guys can trust no-one...not even each other.
