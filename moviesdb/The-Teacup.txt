The Teacup

 The Teacup is a cinematic haiku that tells the story of the life, death, and rebirth of a teacup. A little boy who has killed a bird is given his Master's favorite teacup. The ghost of the bird frightens the boy, causing him to drop and break it. In the end, the cup is reassembled to the satisfaction of the Master, the boy, and the birds.
