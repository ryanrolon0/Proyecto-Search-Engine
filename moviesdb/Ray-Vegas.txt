Ray Vegas

 A young filmmaker, starting out, looks at the other end of the spectrum to an artist who goes by the stage name 'Downtown' Ray Vegas. Ray has tried but never 'made it' and would be considered a 'failed' artist by conventional terms. Despite, this 'Downtown Ray Vegas' persists to do his performance art and create a venue for his work where one does not exist.
