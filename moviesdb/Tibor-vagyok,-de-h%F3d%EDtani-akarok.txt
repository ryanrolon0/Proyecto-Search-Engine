Tibor vagyok, de hódítani akarok

 "Young, dumb and full of love!" is a hilarious comedy about sex, love and youth. What happens when a clumsy teenage boy meets the woman of his dreams? A woman who's a little bit older, a little bit married, and a little bit unfaithful -Hey, nobody's perfect! But, she does exist; you can see her, you can touch her, sometimes she even seems interested... so you just have to make her yours. Only it's not that simple. Your great plans become great disasters as you try to overcome a jealous husband, a nerve-wracking lover, a paternalistic janitor, a bashful paddle-boat lender and a girl, who may deserve a lot more attention than the "dream woman" herself.
