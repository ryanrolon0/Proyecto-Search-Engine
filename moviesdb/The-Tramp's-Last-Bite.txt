The Tramp's Last Bite

 "This is the first of series of excellent comedy boating pictures taken amid picturesque surroundings, and worked out by competent actors. In this scene a tramp is shown, seated on a box in the bow of an old flat-bottomed boat fishing. Frequent nips at the bottle have made him rather drowsy, and two summer girls seeing him in this condition row up and slyly give his boat a bump. The shock is sufficient to throw him floundering into the water. He clambers back to his boat, and the girls row away laughing."
