The Lump

 George is a complete social outcast. One day he notices a lump on his head, which the doctor pronounces benign; the next day, it becomes a second head, much better looking; he hides his real head, and suddenly becomes much more popular. George becomes a politician, on a "save the snails" platform; he gets recruited as an empty suit for some evil advisors and is swept into office.
