The Genesis Code

 A former national security expert (Christensen), while investigating the murder of his only sister and her young son, discovers that a religious sect called The Shadow of the Cross may be involved. With the help of his sister's friend Ana, they follow the clues to a clinic in the mountains of Italy, where a terrifying secret experiment has been conducted - successfully. The results are so threatening to the foundation of the Church that they will do anything to keep it from being revealed.
