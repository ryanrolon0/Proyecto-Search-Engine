Recover

 It's only been a few months since Audrey (Jessica Knowles) left her old life behind. Lexi, her old pornstar name, the drug abuse, the jail time; all slowly fade into the past as she moves on with her new life, with her best friend Wendy (Alisha Clegg) by her side. Except that Pearce (Jerramy Acker) isn't quite ready to let go of his pornstar yet. His property. His Lexi. And he isn't going to let her go without a fight, either.
