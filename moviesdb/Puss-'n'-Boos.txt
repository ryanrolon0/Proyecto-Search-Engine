Puss 'n' Boos

 Casper the Friendly Ghost saves three kittens and they accept the unpopular little ghost as their friend. They and Casper have a lot of fun and the level-headed little specter stays busy keeping them out of mischief. Casper finds a good home for the orphaned-kittens but, despite the comforts of their new home, the kittens escape and return to their ghost-friend.
