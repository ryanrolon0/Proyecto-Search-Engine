 Rash explores the cultural value of unsanctioned public art and the ways that street art and graffiti contributes to a very public dialogue. This story conveys the commitment, ideals and beliefs demonstrated in this thriving alternative art practice. These artists utilize a variety of approaches including bill posters, stencils, and performance, broadcasting their under represented views that bang away at the community conscience by sticking this artwork right in the public eye. Melbourne has become an attractive place for both local and visiting graffiti artists who arrive from interstate and overseas to leave their mark. With the approaching Commonwealth Games in 2006 local councils have a juggling act on their hands to present a clean and safe city for visitors. This is art and it belongs! The spirit of rebellion is being channeled into street art and these visual conversations are spreading across the walls of Melbourne. This documentary offers a rare look inside these graffiti artists world view.
