Troll Tour

 Four lonely and curious individuals travel around the United States for one month interviewing 13 self-proclaimed "Trolls", in an effort to make new friends face-to-face with beings they've communicated with on the internet. In the process, they discover the beauty that lies within the modern-day Troll.
