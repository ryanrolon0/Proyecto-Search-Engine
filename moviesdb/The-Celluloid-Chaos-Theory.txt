The Celluloid Chaos Theory

 Waking to strange voices one night, Thomas discovers his reality is confined in a celluloid shell. He believes he has been contacted by a higher power and given the charge to save the dying medium of film. No one is particularly interested in believing, or even listening to him, though; not his narcissistic, wannabe-actress girlfriend, or his shallow, commercial-producing boss. As his reality begins to collapse under the weight of a crass digital culture, his efforts soon bring down a chaotic retaliation from the electronic menace. Driven to the brink of madness, Thomas tries desperately to get someone, anyone to listen to him. But, in the end, he relents in the face of change and finds himself consumed and transformed by the New Medium.
