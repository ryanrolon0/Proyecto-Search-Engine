Stop the Children Burning

 This confronting documentary tells the story of three tragic house fires in which children were killed because their families relied on ionization smoke alarms. It also exposes the fraud and corruption that has led to millions of people around the world using ionization smoke alarms in the mistaken belief that they will be protected from fire. Produced by The World Fire Safety Foundation in conjunction with Planet Fire Safety.
