The Sloane Affair

 The authorities are conducting a fraud investigation against Alan H. Sloane, a wealthy property developer. The known fraud, worth $8,200, concerns concrete used for the building of his own residence, the cost of that concrete which was charged to one of his commercial properties. The authorities are trying to find out if this fraud is a one time only or chronic endeavor. They take a coordinated approach by targeting all the Sloane Construction offices, Sloane's lawyer's office and the Sloane residence at the same time, they seizing a copious amount of documents and files. Sloane seems slightly confused but incredulous as to the charges and large scale of the investigation. As the authorities get into the investigation, the fraud seems to be chronic, yet others around Sloane are implicated more than him. Was Sloane's only crime that he blindly trusted those around him, or was he truly and fully complicit in defrauding the government with his cavalier attitude a belief he really did nothing wrong?
