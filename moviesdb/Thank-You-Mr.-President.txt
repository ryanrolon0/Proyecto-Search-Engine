Thank You Mr. President

 Anytime, anywhere. In a fictional world security meeting seven heads of state and government consult about a violation against Resolution 4114. One of the allied republics is disregarding the order for disarmament. The atmosphere is tense, faces are solemn. It is at this round table that the decision for war or peace will be made. And yet presidents present. But suddenly the speaker (the head of state on the floor) flies off the handle. He threatens to bring to justice one of the presidents there and then. All of a sudden masks are dropped at the conference table. Each one is at the same time aggressor and victim. "Doom's Day" is only a bat of an eyelid away. Nothing short of a miracle will save the world from unavoidable bloodshed.
