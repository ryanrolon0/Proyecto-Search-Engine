The Angry Red Planet

 A rocket ship returns from Mars. Contact was lost since the ship arrived on Mars. Now the crew does not answer any radio messages from mission control. The people from mission control try to land the rocket ship by remote control and investigate what happened on Mars. After disappearing without a trace and being given up for lost, a manned probe to Mars is observed returning to Earth but will not respond to any contact. After mission control risks an automated landing, they find that there are only two survivors, one critically injured and with some strange growth on his arm. Doctors turn to the other surviving astronaut, Iris Ryan, for answers, and discover the Martians' angry warning which, to paraphrase, would be, "You Earth kids stay out of my yard!" Our first manned flight to Mars returns after being thought lost in space. Only two survivors (Mohr & Hayden) of the original four are on board. Mohr has a green growth on his arm, and nothing that the doctors do will kill it. Hayden, under hypnosis, tells of their adventures on Mars. Thought to be a dead planet, it's inhabited with man-eating plants, giant Bat-Rat-Spider-Crab monsters, a strange city on a lake, and a one-eyed monster that dissolves anything that it swallows or touches.
