Speaking Out about Ed

 Speaking Out About ED is a powerful new film by Robyn Hussa, Founder and President of NORMAL In Schools, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to education about eating disorders, self-esteem, body image and wellness. Created after five years of research while entrenched in schools and hospitals, this documentary-style film exposes the growing problem of eating disorders and obesity in our society, debunks myths, explores treatment options, and calls for better training of the medical community in managing this threatening condition. It cites the untimely deaths of three talented students caused by the unrelenting destruction of eating disorders, and in doing so, reveals a health care system and medical community that is often woefully inadequate in providing solutions.
