The World on Fire

 The World On Fire tells the story of Blaze, a young man who after the loss of his partner, Ash, retreats into a world of pain and mental anguish. Trapped in the world that the two once shared, no escape is in sight. A beautiful, surreal, and honest Art Film that begs the question; could any hell be any more real and horrible than this?
