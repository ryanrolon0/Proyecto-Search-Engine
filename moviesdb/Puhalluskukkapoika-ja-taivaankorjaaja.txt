Puhalluskukkapoika ja taivaankorjaaja

 One day in winter, Lennu's two little brothers disappear. Their footprints in the snow lead to the half-frozen sea, in the direction of a nearby island where Lennu took his brothers the past summer. The guilt-stricken boy sees flashbacks of their happy days together while helping his parents and the local police in their search.
