The Friends of Eddie Coyle

 Eddie's friends are numerous, but the term friends is suspect. As a small time hood Eddie is about to go back to jail. In order to escape this fate he deals information on stolen guns to the feds. Simultaneously he is supplying arms to his bank robbing/kidnapping hoodlum chums. But who else is dealing with the feds? Who gets the blame for snitching on the bank robbers? Low level serial criminal Eddie Coyle is awaiting sentencing for his latest conviction for which he expects to get up to five years in prison. This situation doesn't stop Eddie from continuing his criminal connections, namely acquiring guns for his associates' bank robbery spree. Regardless, Eddie, at age fifty-one and with a wife and children to support, doesn't feel like he can emotionally endure another prison sentence. As such, Eddie contemplates providing information to a local police officer, Dave Foley, in exchange for no prison time. Eddie knows a little about a lot of criminal activities, but will this be enough to satisfy Foley? And Eddie has had past experience about crossing the wrong people, so he has to tread carefully about who he gives up information.
