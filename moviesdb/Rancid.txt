Rancid

 Once a promising writer, John Hayson now gets by on the odd writing job. A personal tragedy has left him dispassionate about the world and his work and he lives his life in limbo. In the midst of this existential crisis he attends a high school reunion and meets three old friends; acquaintances he's tried to forget but who now emerge like ominous shadows from his past. Once again, face to face with the love of his life, Hayson tries to right old wrongs and get his life back on track. However, life has other plans, and he realizes that the past is best laid to rest or it might haunt you forever. He soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish brew of deceit, passion and murder. Wanted by the police for a heinous killing, he must choose between succumbing to his darkest desires or the light that will renew his faith in himself and his future.
