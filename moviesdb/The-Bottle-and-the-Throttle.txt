The Bottle and the Throttle

 We're at the scene at a traffic accident who's had a couple of beers, has hit a mother and child crossing the street. As he waits, an off-screen narrator takes us through data about how alcohol impairs driving. The narrator, simple animated illustrations, and filmed simulations provide information about drinkers gaining assurance but losing self-control, taking chances, doing dumb things. Drinking impairs vision as well as reaction time. The narrator makes recommendations based on research. We go back to the lake where Bill was drinking with his pals. Then it's back to Bill at the scene of the accident
