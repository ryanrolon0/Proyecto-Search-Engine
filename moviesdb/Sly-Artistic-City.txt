Sly Artistic City

 Some argue that modern graffiti was born in Philadelphia, where the pioneers of wall-writing became citywide celebrities during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Graffiti eventually consumed the city, and a new mayor made it his top priority to fight back. In the process, the city's Mural Arts Program was born. Philadelphia is now a great outdoor museum. Yet graffiti still thrives, with new writers always ready to replace those who are caught or quit. Featuring interviews with Cool Earl, Kool Klepto Kidd, and other famous graffiti legends, as well as former Mayor W. Wilson Goode and Mural Arts Program executive director Jane Golden. The documentary was shot, edited and self-financed by Robert Moran, a journalist in Philadelphia and first-time director.
