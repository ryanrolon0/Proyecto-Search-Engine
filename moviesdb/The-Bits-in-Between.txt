The Bits in Between

 The Bits in Between follows the ups and downs of a group of friends who are all in some way pursuing a career in acting or comedy in New York City. Over two days, we watch them bomb and succeed, in life and onstage, until it all culminates in one humiliating, hilarious and ultimately liberating audition.
