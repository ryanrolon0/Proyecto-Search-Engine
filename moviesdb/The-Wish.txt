The Wish

 A dark and atmospheric twisting film with just a touch of horror, about a man who is thrown in to a new dimension of isolation between light and shadow, where there are no exits, where fear replaces knowledge and science, where he must fight his imagination and his thoughts, to find a way back to the real world.
