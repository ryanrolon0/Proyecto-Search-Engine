Rhythm and Weep

 The stooges are actors who can't seem to find a job, so they decide to jump off a high building and end it all. On the roof top they meet three girl dancers with the same idea. Before they can jump, they meet a millionaire Broadway producer who hires them all for his next show. The rehearsal goes so well that he doubles their salary, but it all comes to naught when they discover that the "producer" is an escaped patient from Dr. Dippy's retreat.
