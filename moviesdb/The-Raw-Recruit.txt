The Raw Recruit

 A French soldier has just been assigned to his quarters in the barracks, and removes his uniform preparatory to taking a well-earned night's rest. His uniform, however, appears to have a strong liking for the recruit, for each time it is removed it flies back on his body in a most laughable and startling way. He endeavors to evade it in numerous ways, finally springing hastily into bed, but when he again emerges from between the sheets the knapsack and uniform are still on his back.
