Velkommen hjem

 A warm, charming and entertaining documentary about several first or second generation immigrants living in Oslo and Bergen. You will among others meet an immigrant on skis, an African woman living in Bergen who refuses to be buried any other place than her native Tanzania, a Norwegian army recruit from Sri Lanka, an Afghan business woman and a drug-addict of Norwegian-African heritage. Welcome Home flips your assumptions of immigrants upside-down whilst being a different take on the term 'home'.
