The Dream Doll

 Knutt, a chemist as eccentric as his name suggests, discovers a magic elixir to bring dolls to life. When Ruby, the beautiful daughter of the toy king, is overcome by the potion's fumes, a male doll which the chemist has brought to life seizes the elixir and pours it on her. As a result, she turns into a doll too. With the elixir the two dolls rush out and find a justice of the peace doll, whom they bring to life so they can be married. While Knutt and the father anxiously seek Ruby, the dolls leave on their honeymoon and select a dog kennel as their home.
