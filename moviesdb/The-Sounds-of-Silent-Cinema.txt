The Sounds of Silent Cinema

 This Chapman University graduate student documentary short explores the world of musical accompaniment involving Silent Films. Through interviews with professors, film historians and musicians the Silent Film era (1895-1927) is seen as not silent at all - Wurlitzer organs, pianos, one man bands, small combos, large orchestras and Fotoplayers added underscore to the silent film on the screen.
