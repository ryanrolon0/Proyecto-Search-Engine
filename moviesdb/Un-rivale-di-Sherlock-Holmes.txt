Un rivale di Sherlock Holmes

 One of the world's earliest "Sherlock" films (according to David S Davies' book, "Holmes of the Movies" (1968), and now lost. It was preceded by, and soon followed by, films from the US, Denmark, Germany, England, France, and other lands, many of them made without permission from author A C Doyle and his representatives. Apparently some of these early borrowers got around Doyle's copyrights by claiming the characters were not Doyle's own creations but merely admirers of them, as in this Italian "spin-off" from 1907. When "Rival of Sherlock" was imported to the US in 1908, it was reviewed by "Moving Picture World" (quoted by Davies), crediting the detective-hero (Sherlock's "rival") as using several disguises as he tracks down the crooks amidst some action-filled confrontations. As with many other film primitives made that early, "Rival of Sherlock" unfortunately lacks individual credits (director, star, producer, etc.), even in Aldo Bernardini's huge catalog of Italian silent films ("Archivio del cinema italiano," v. 1, 1991). Incidentally, the US distributor of this film seems to have mistranslated its title as "Rival Sherlock Holmes" [sic] -- the incomplete title then passed on by "Moving Picture World" and by Davies.
