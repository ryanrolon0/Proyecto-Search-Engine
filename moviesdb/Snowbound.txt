Snowbound

 Two thousand miles from home, Jim and Jennifer Stolpa (with baby Clayton) lose their way and are stranded in an endless wilderness of deep snow, battling for survival against the elements. Using only meager supplies and resourcefulness, the young couple struggles to keep themselves and their infant son alive in a frozen shelter while awaiting rescue. Realizing they won't be found, Jim ultimately strikes out on a courageous 50-mile mission, determined to reach help and return to save his loved ones in this exciting and moving true story. Based on a true story, when travelling through the mountains in their car with their infant, Jim and Jennifer end snowbound, as the title would suggest, when a big snowstorm traps them in. After staying in the car for a couple of days they leave the vehicle behind and head out on foot to find help.
