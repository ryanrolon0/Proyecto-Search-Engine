The Chess Player

 1944 Britain, the most brilliant chess player of his time is held captive by the Secret Intelligence Service, on suspicion of detaining secret strategic information about the Allies' Normandy landing. Unwilling to confess, chess genius A. W. McKinloch is held captive by other chess player Colonel Ramsay, who offers him a year-long chess challenge to regain his freedom or confess his involvement in strategic counter-intelligences activities. As time passes and the chess duel goes on, McKinloch's strength slowly turns against him, putting at risk his own sanity as well as the political future of Western Europe.
