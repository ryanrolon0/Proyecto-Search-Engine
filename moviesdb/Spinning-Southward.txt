Spinning Southward

 A documentary film following 3 bicyclists who traveled from the far northern shores of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska - through 13 countries - to Ushuaia, Argentina in support of the National Brain Tumor Society. The riders, brothers John and Mike Logdson and filmmaker, Nateon Ajello, were inspired by the memory of their mothers, Jean Logdson and Fran Ajello. By the end of their journey in September 2006, the cyclists raised more than $75,000 for the National Brain Tumor Society and had reached out to thousands of families both personally and through media along the way.
