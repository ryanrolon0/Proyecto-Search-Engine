Spring Break

 Stu & O.T. are two studs from the big city who arrive in Fort Lauderdale for spring break. They discover that the room they had reserved in an over-crowded motel is already being occupied by Nelson & Adam, a pair of college-nerds. With no other accomodations available, Nelson & Adam reluctantly agree to share the room with Stu & O.T., who promise to show them a good time. The wet-T-shirt contests and beer-guzzling-fun are threatened when Nelson's controlling step-dad shows up, along with a building inspector who wants to shut down the motel.
