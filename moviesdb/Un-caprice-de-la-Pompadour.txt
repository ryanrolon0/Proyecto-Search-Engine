Un caprice de la Pompadour

 Gaston de MEville has written a libel against Madame de Pompadour and her Royal Lover, King Louis XV. But the Marchioness is all the less mad at Garston as she has fallen for him and she does all she can to save him from the punishment he normally deserves. One night, while is performing in a play at the Palace, he is denounced. But the King is merciful to Gaston and his content to banish him to Canada.
