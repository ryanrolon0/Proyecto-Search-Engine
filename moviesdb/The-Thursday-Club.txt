The Thursday Club

 On October 17, 1967, an Associated Press photographer snaps a photo of a baton-wielding cop and a demonstrator during "Stop the Draft Week." Thirty years later, that protester (George Paul Csicsery) interviews retired Oakland policemen who meet for lunch every Thursday - how they entered the force (many were World War II vets), their private lives, their memories of war protests and of confrontations with the Black Panthers, and their thoughts now about those events. Reflections on war, race, class, law enforcement, family, and aging are mixed with archival footage of rallies, protests, and the Vietnam War itself.
