The Secret Safari

 A dramatized documentary showing how volunteers from England and Holland drove trucks full of hidden guns and ammunition overland across Africa to supply the African National Congress in their fight against the Apartheid government. Forty tons were transported under the seats of unsuspecting tourists on Africa Hinterland Expeditions between 1987 and 1993. No-one was ever caught and the mission remained one of the ANC's deepest secrets until 2001. The simple but ingenious technique of hiding the weapons was made more effective by the cover of the white tourists and the European drivers. In the 'Secret Safari' the filmmakers found the original tourists and reveal the most unusual holiday secret to very different responses.
