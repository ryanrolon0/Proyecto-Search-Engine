Pretty Ugly

 After inheriting his grandmother's estate in the secluded countryside, Alex finds the corpse of a man who committed suicide. Rather than report his finding to the officials, Alex includes the dead body into his daily workout routine by carrying it around in a wheel barrel. Once Alex returns to society, however, he finds it incredibly difficult to handle those who are still among the living. Pretty Ugly is a visually stunning, no-budget, psychological study about a young man who is obsessed with self discipline and how his obsession eventually leads to murder.
