Romeo

 ROMEO follows domestic violence counselor Antonio Arrendel's personal and professional challenge to rehabilitate batterers in Boston. A facilitator at one of the country's first batterer intervention agencies, Antonio runs groups for men convicted of domestic violence assaults. Antonio is frustrated. For seven years, he has seen multiple men re-offend and retake his class. As an experiment, Antonio sidesteps the standard professional edict against fraternization with clients to befriend two men, Scott and Cup, to test whether his personal sponsorship will curb their "addiction."
