To Empower Women

 With Wangari Mathai of Kenya, 2005 Nobel Prize Winner. Now, on the 10th anniversary of the historic United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, we relive the experience. Here, women movingly tell of their needs for human rights and how they work to improve their lives. Issues are the need for economic development and peace, education of girls and women, better child care, outlawing the trafficking of women, payment for comfort women survivors, and recognition that women's rights are human rights. Narrated by the late Bella Abzug, she notes that 'The global women's movement is alive and well.' Videoed at the Non-Governmental Forum in Huairou, China, September, 1995.
