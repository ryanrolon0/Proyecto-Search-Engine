The Coast

 The First Bank sign burns bright neon red, shining out like a beacon over the city of St. Paul. In the dark recesses of the building, two janitors work endless nights scouring offices of the traces of daily decay. Amid all the clutter and the incidental forgotten details, a man begins to recognize the echoes of a faraway life... and falls for a woman he's never met, but knows all too well.
