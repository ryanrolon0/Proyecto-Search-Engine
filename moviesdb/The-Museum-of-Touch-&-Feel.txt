The Museum of Touch & Feel

 The way in which we connect with the past through objects and spaces. In this museum the guests would touch the artifacts instead of looking at them. The creator of the museum is now gone, but the building remains as a physical extension of her, a virtual body which the narrator inhabits. Presented stereoscopically, the museum is an ephemeral sculpture, a synaesthetic realm which viewers "touch" using their eyes as fingers.
