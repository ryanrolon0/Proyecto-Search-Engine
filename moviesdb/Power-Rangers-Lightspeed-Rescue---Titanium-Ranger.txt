Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue - Titanium Ranger

 The evil Diabolico vows to destroy Earth and only the Power Rangers stand between his horrible monsters and Earth's survival! But one Ranger is out-for-the-count as he fights for his very life. When the Titanium Ranger wakes to find he's been marked with a mysterious cobra tattoo, he realizes his days are numbered. Every time he morphs the cobra creeps up his body and gets closer to striking him. Ordered not to fight until a way is found to break the curse, the Titanium Ranger must sit back while the other Rangers risk it all. But Diabolico's monsters are far too powerful. The battle can't be won without the Titanium Ranger! Will he chance his own destruction to help his fellow Rangers? Can the curse be broken before it's too late? Or will Diabolico strike his final blow?
