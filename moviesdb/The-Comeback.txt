The Comeback

 Scotty Malloy is a former NFL football player who travels around the world without a care. He decides to come back to Minneapolis to settle down and start a life for himself. He pays a visit to his ex-wife, and his son, Bo. Bo is in a very nice relationship with Jessica, a girl across the river he lives on. Jessica takes a liking to Scotty, and they begin a relationship behind Bo's back. This adds to the list of Scotty's irresponsibilities. Problems ensue, and it keeps Scotty from making his "comeback" in life.
