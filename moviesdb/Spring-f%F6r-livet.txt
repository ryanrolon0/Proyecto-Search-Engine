Spring för livet

 Without forewarning the police storm the hospital where Catti has given birth to her and Mikael's child. In the chaos that comes voices are heard that scream "terrorists" and "illegal stay". Catti's room mate jumps out from the hospital's third floor in a panic, and leaves her child... Catti and Mikael are drawn into a dreadful scenario which step by step take them into a brutal and unknown Sweden, far from the dream of family happiness they just now had within reach. After giving birth to a son, Catti and her husband Mikael get entangled in an organization that hides illegal immigrants in Sweden. They slowly realize that their picture perfect country in reality is built on police brutality, state coercion and inhuman immigration policies.
