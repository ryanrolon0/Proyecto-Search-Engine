Waking Olguita

 In the four years since her husband's death, Olguita has found security in the predictability of her daily routine. When her daughter, Marta, acts against her will and arranges for an American exchange student to live in Olguita's home, the old woman hopes that ignoring her unwelcome young guest will make her go away. But as Katherine, the young girl, seeks to befriend her host, Olguita must either give up the safety of her quiet world or risk shutting out life forever
