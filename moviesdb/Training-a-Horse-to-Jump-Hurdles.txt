Training a Horse to Jump Hurdles

 An expert horseman is seated upon a handsome white horse and is training him to jump hurdles. The horse and rider are kept constantly within the vision of the camera, the horse jumping back and forth over the same hurdle. This is a very picturesque and amusing scene, and it is a remarkably fine piece of photography with a beautiful background.
