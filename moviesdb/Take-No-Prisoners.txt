Take No Prisoners

 Three childhood friends raised in the housing projects of Brooklyn grow into men of the streets, taking three separate paths in a common search for a way out of the ghetto. When a murder gone wrong reunites them, loyalty and betrayal will determine who lives and who dies at the hands of a murderous drug lord. Will their friendship be the bond that saves them, or will survival of the fittest determine who makes it out of this urban war?
