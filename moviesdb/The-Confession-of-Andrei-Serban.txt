The Confession of Andrei Serban

 June 2005. A young woman, age 24, died following an exorcising ritual performed at the Tanacu Monastery, in the north-est of Romania. The exact cause of her death was not clear. Tatiana Niculescu-Bran wrote a book about this case, which was also turned into a play. The lawsuit filled against the priest had not ended yet when a group of actors led by director Andrei Serban were already bringing the Tanacu case on stage. This is the story of a play being built upon real people and real facts.
