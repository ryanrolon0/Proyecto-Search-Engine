The Devil and Sarah Silverspoon

 Driven perfectionist Sarah Silverspoon, furious after years of Second Place at her church's yearly bake sale, sells her soul to the Devil in an attempt to wrest First from dimwitted rival Henrietta George. To Sarah's dismay, the Devil proves to be a depressed inept who loses his every contest with God. Failing to derail Henrietta with Satan's useless schemes, a desperate Sarah pushes him to kill Henrietta. This, too, the Devil botches, and Sarah finds herself faced with her enemy's winning confections even in death.
