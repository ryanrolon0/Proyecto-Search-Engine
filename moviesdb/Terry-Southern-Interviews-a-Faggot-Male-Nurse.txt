Terry Southern Interviews a Faggot Male Nurse

 Terry Southern interviews a Male Nurse that turns out to be gay. Then Terry investigates the implications of the medical profession and a gay staff meanwhile he infers to a politically unsettling medical system in regards to the 1960's. Quirky and though provoking.
