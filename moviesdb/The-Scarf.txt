The Scarf

 When two high school girls, Daniella and Krista, find themselves working on a School Science Project about UFOs, they soon realize that they may be in a little over their heads. After family problems and an over-obsessive personality mislead Daniella to thinking that she must experience a UFO in order to get a good grade, this project soon threatens to tear apart her friendships, family, and even her very own life.
