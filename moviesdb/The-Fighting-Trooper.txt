The Fighting Trooper

 When the Ranger Sergeant returns murdered with a note that LaFarge did it, Trooper Burke sets out to after LaFarge. Working undercover, he saves LaFarge's life and this gets him into LaFarge's gang. He then arrests LaFarge and brings him in only to learn that LaFarge is not only innocent but is now a prisoner of the real killer. A gang of night-riding marauders are terrorizing the Canadian Northwest, robbing miners, trappers and businesses, and also kill a Sergeant of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Trooper Burke volunteers to go undercover and see if he can put an end to the lawlessness, supposedly led by a man named Andre LaFarge. Posing as a lumberjack, Burke gets close to the gang, but complications arise when he falls in live with LaFarge's sister, Diana.
