Souvenirs

 Lyrical, intimate, and sometimes humorous, Souvenirs is a eulogy in film of a Veteran whose Post Traumatic Stress Disorder case is actively under review by the Veterans' Affairs office 8 years after his suicide. Ivars 'Andy' Pelecis was a man who wanted to move on. Andy survived the Vietnam War physically, but lived without recognition of his war related mental illness until the day he took his own life in 2002. After 30 years of struggling to 'survive the peace' through alcohol, and ten stays in the locked ward at hospital, Andy's case was reopened by his social workers. Mara Pelecis, Andy's daughter, seeks to reveal her dad's real story that was hidden from her as a child.
