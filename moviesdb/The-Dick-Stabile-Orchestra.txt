The Dick Stabile Orchestra

 Thie ten-minute (one-reel) short, released by Columbia Pictures, should not be confused with (nor merged as the same) as the 16-minute (two-reels) short that Universal released in the same year, 1952, that has Dick Stabile in the title. It's the same man, leading the same orchestra, but different songs and different side performers in the cast. This one has Del Casino in it, and also has Madame La Vell dancing. When in doubt, check ALL the data on similar-named shorts.
