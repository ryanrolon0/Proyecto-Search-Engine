The 8th Bullet

 It was around 11 am in Paris and Marcelo Paganini was inside Eurostar for his first trip ever to London. At the same time it was around 10 am in London, and Jean Charles de Menezes was inside the Stockwell Tube Station in London. Two Brazilian guys inside a train at the same time, but one of them had 7 shots in the head and one in the shoulder. The surviving guy arrives in London and tries to understand why.
