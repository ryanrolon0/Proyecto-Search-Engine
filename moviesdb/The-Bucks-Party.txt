The Bucks Party

 Aron doesn't get to see his old mate Tim as often as he'd like to these days, so it comes as no real surprise when Aron discovers that Tim has asked Dave, a bloke he works with, to be the best man at his upcoming wedding. Ever the loyal friend, Aron shrugs off any small feelings of jealousy he might harbor and commits instead to a night of partying and drunken celebrations with his mate for his bucks party. But that night Aron discovers something about the best man that could well and truly derail the marriage before it even starts, and has to then question his own motives before deciding what to do with the information.
