Saat Hindustani

 A Muslim poet Anwar Ali, along with five other men all from different religions, and from different parts of the country join Maria, a native of Portuguese-occupied Goa, to raise nationalist sentiment in that state by hoisting Indian flags on Portuguese forts and buildings. In the process they find unity and abandon their religious and regional differences. The film begins with a dying Maria who summons her former comrades and ends with the comrades assembling before her and reiterating their faith in nationalism.
