True Gunner

 World War II veteran, Pike Levine, provides a firsthand account of fighting the Nazis from inside a glass bubble under the belly of a B-17. The unenviable position of ball turret gunner took the brunt of the enemy's fury and was considered by many to be simply suicidal. In his compelling straight forward style, Levine tells it like it was, on the ground and in the air. Effective use of historical imagery rounds out this personal film.
