Rozmowy noca

 It is a romantic comedy which is a combination of a charming and moving story of When Harry Met Sally with the craziness, humor and enchantment of Love Actually. It is a positive and optimistic story of two thirty-something people who are made for each other, Matylda and Bartek, who are needing and looking for love and closeness, but who are constantly missing each other in the course of their lives.
