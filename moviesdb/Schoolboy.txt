Schoolboy

 Ed Fish is an awkward schoolboy, spending his days trying to avoid confrontation. If he could, he'd be a ghost and slip by stealthily, drawing no attention to himself at all. But when Ed becomes a hostage in his own Class Room he is forced to make a choice that will change his life forever. Keep quiet and live to see another day? Or make a stand and save the one he loves?
