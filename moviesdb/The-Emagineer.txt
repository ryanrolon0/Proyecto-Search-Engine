The Emagineer

 In this special effects laden short movie, a superhero magician, the Emagineer, flies into the theater auditorium and asks movie goers to shut off all cell phones. Those who don't find their phones or themselves magically disappeared after being zapped by his super-powered wand. The Emagineer then flies off past the big screen to the applause of the movie goers everywhere.
