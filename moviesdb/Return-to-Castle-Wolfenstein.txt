Return to Castle Wolfenstein

 You play B.J. Blazkowicz, an World War II American secret agent, who is sent to investigate reports of bizarre experiments being conducted by Nazi Germany's special weapons research facilities involving the occult. What you find is more frightening than can be imagined and that much harder to stop as you must battle not only the Nazi hordes, but also the stuff of nightmares not including the monstrosities that twisted Nazi science have created.
