The Enchanted Treehouse

 While skipping through the woods Sarah comes upon Marcel and Florette working on a miniature fairy tale house. When Marcel and Florette leave the house, its tiny inhabitants come to life and speak to Sarah. She meets Stephan and Reuben and hears the story of The Enchanted Treehouse. Sarah is guided through all the rooms by each little person. When the people agree to let Sarah return they realize they may have compromised the secrecy Marcel and Florette have kept for the last one hundred years.
