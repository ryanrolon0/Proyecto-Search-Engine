The Man Who Walked Between the Towers

 Tells the story of Philippe Petit, the wire walker and street performer who walked across the sky, in 1974, on a cable that he and friends strung between the rooftops of the Twin Towers. Told as an animated children's book with an off-screen narrator, the film traces Philippe's passion and imagination, provides details of how he managed to get the wire in place, and completes the story of his subsequent arrest and his fitting punishment. The film celebrates his act as a thing of beauty that is part of our collective memory of the Twin Towers.
