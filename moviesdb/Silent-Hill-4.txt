Silent Hill 4

 Henry Townshend wakes up one day to realize that his apartment has been chained and bolted shut...from the inside. All by himself inside the creepy apartment room, he tries calling for help, but no one can hear him. Henry's only escape is through a strange portal-like hole that appears in his bathroom, but the hole takes him to strange places, which house strange secrets, and even stranger creatures. Henry must go through this hole if he wants to get away from his apartment, which is slowly being invaded by an evil force, and must attempt to find an answer for who or what locked him in... Two years ago Henry Townshend moved into South Ashfield Heights, an apartment complex in the city of Ashfield. Henry was happy and enjoyed his new life. But five days ago, Henry began having a recurring dream each night. There was one other thing; he couldn't leave room 302. Now Henry must travel alone to other worlds and watch helplessly as horrific acts of murder unfold before him. Desperately trying to stop the killer, knowing that it is impossible, Henry faces ghosts and demons in his attempt to escape the room, before he himself falls victim to its curse...
