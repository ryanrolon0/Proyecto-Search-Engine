 Deidre, looking to shed her South Boston accent, her aimless boyfriend and all other things that identify her as lower class, sees a way out one night when Arthur, a wealthy Beacon Hill Brahmin, appears in the pub where she works and invites her back to his luxurious townhouse. Their differences appear to evaporate over a bottle of wine, at least until the following morning.
