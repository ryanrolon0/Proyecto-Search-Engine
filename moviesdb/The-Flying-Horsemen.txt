The Flying Horsemen

 This is the ultimate Helicopter action adventure film centered on the exploits of B troop, lst. squadron of the 9th air cavalry. Laurence Guccione , Phil Newhouse, Marco Sanchez,and Clyde Boatwright were members of the resonance squadron of the 9th Cavalry, plunged into a fierce new kind of aerial warfare in Vietnam, striking at the heart of the heavily armed enemy. For over six years of nearly nonstop action in Ia Drang, Khe San, Binh Dinh and Quang Tri, they moved by helicopter, battled large NVA forces and scored an extraordinary number of kills, half the enemy soldiers killed by the entire 1st Air Cavalry Division. The scouts and gunship pilots were definitely the prima Donna of the air cavalry.
