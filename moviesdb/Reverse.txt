Reverse

 A man stops to go to the bathroom and runs into a kid that puts a reversal spell on him. On his way back to the car he realizes that he can't make it there no matter how long he walks towards it. He turns around and begins walking the other way and has a flashback of what the kid said to him. When he turns around to look back at the car, it is right next to him. In order for him to get to the car, he had to walk away from it. As the film progresses, you see all the different things that he needs to do in reverse in order to get them to work.
