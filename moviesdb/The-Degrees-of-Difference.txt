The Degrees of Difference

 'Grant Patten' (qv) guides us through disparate Toronto buildings - some inhabited, others abandoned - in a seemingly impossible pursuit to unite the dissimilar. The documentary addresses issues of film making ethics while paying homage to the universal endeavor of attempting to find an organization for things. The Degrees of Difference is about the struggle for organization and the common desire to unite the dissimilar. It is in this respect that the documentary also contains elements of absurdism and is therefore quite humorous at times. Architecture plays a primary role in this project, as the narrator explores multiple Toronto buildings in an attempt to fulfill his objective. The Degrees of Difference pays tribute to the universal endeavor of attempting to find an organization for things. "Whether one is trying to find a good form of organization for some objects, for a series of images, or for their life - it is always an admirable pursuit."
