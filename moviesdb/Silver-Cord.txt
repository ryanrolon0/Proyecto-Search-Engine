Silver Cord

 College student Andrew Gardner is obsessed with the love of his life, Claudia. But he can only see her in the astral plane during an OBE (Out of Body Experience). The silver cord that connects his spirit to his body breaks and he is believed to be dead. In a desperate race against time his friends, Charles and Georgie, have less than 24 hours to save Andrew's soul before his body is cremated.
