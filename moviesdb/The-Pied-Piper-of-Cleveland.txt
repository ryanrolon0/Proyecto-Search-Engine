The Pied Piper of Cleveland

 Elvis Presley's first film is a documentary on the career of disc jockey Bill Randle, who in the 1950s was as well known as Alan Freed. Due to legal problems over ownership of the film, this movie was only shown in public once, and has yet to be released officially. Universal Studios reportedly still has the negatives in its vaults.
