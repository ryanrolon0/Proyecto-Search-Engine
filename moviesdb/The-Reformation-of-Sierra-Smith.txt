The Reformation of Sierra Smith

 Sierra is a bad man through and through, but passionately loves his child and it is this parental devotion that finally works his cure. At one time in his checkered career he holds up and robs a stage coach, carrying a young doctor who is coming to the West to build up a practice. Among the various articles which the bad man gets is a watch belonging to the doctor, which the child afterwards secures as a plaything. When the child grows sick and the young doctor is sent for, he recognizes his watch and demands explanations from the wife. Sierra discovers that the doctor is aware of his identity and is about to shoot him, hen the thought that the child owes his life to him stays in his hand. The doctor promises to keep the secret of who he is, if he will agree to reform and be kind to his family, which, of course, he does.
