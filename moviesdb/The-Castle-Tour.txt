The Castle Tour

 A number of people come to an old castle to have a guided tour of it. The guide however, does not realize that they are Swedish and speaks very home-made English; English that no Swede, nor English-speaking person would ever understand. For instance, the guide refers to the upper class as "Bimbodocksockers". During the tour of the castle, the people come upon a number of events, unknown to the guide, who keeps going on and on in his incomprehensible language.
