The Cow's Kimona

 A city couple, after two years of saving, can finally afford a vacation, and they head west to the wide-open spaces and peaceful tranquility. Their old flivver of an automobile barely gets them there but they finally arrive at the guest ranch. However, "Ma", who runs the ranch is given to night-spells of shooting off her pistols, and she's got plenty of ammunition.
