The Unstrument

He hires two down-at-heel private dicks, an extraterrestrial and a twelve year old boy, to look into the case. Their investigations will set them adrift in a crazy world of sound and chaos where noise terrorists, global conglomerates, festival organisers, sound sculptresses and Tyrolean circuit bending saxophonists thrive in a jungle of petty jealousies, pretension and blind ambition. For anyone with musical taste the future is looking bleak. Murder, mayhem, music and mystery abound in The Unstrument a major new full length motion picture from the imaginative psyche of Libre Albedrio.
