The Water's Edge

 Brian Dockett's death forever changes the lives of his wife and children. This family finds itself inexplicably and unavoidably changed forever. The frustration at the impact of other's actions on this family is only compounded by the fact that they seem powerless to make desired changes in their own lives. Change is both unavoidable and unreachable, so like many people the Docketts just settle into the routine of life, hoping each day will get a little bit better, hoping for once not to have to learn every lesson the hard way.
