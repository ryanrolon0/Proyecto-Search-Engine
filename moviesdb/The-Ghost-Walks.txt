The Ghost Walks

 On a stormy night, a theatrical producer, his secretary, and playwright Prescott Ames are stranded when their car skids off the road and gets stuck. The three take refuge in the nearby home of Dr. Kent, a friend of Ames. One of Kent's patients, who is staying at the house, is acting strangely, and the others in the house tell the newcomers that she is behaving this way because it is the anniversary of her husband's murder. At dinner, the group begins exchanging accusations about the murder, when suddenly the lights go out, and soon afterwards comes the first in a series of mysterious and fearful events. Playwright Prescott Ames and his secretary, Glora Shaw, are bringing a producer, Herman Wood and his secretary, Erskine, to Prescott's country home to hear Prescott read his latest play. Unknown to Wood, Prescott has hired a group of actor to enact the first act with the producer unconsciously playing a part. But, after the first act, an escaped lunatic enters the house, and starts rewriting the play, while Wood and Erskine think that the madman's attempts at murdering various cast members is just part of the play.
