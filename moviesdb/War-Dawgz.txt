War Dawgz

 A small rag tag team of plastic building block figurines is thrown in to peril as an invading alien force destroys most of humanity. Once the initial battle is over, it becomes a race for survival as the alien force continues to hunt down and destroy the surviving members of the Alliance. Mankind's only hope for survival is a fighter squadron full of misfits and foul mouthed idiots known as the Dawg Squadron
