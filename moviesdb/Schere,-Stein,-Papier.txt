Schere, Stein, Papier

 "Schere, Stein, Papier" (engl. "Scissors, Paper, Stone" the children's game) is a short movie about the issue of feeling strange to something. The plot is all about the 22-year old Emilie, who has gone blind at the age of 17, and still can't cope with this situation. Feeling strange to the world and strange to herself, she almost misses her only chance of salvation, when Terrence, a former class-mate at elementary school, shows up and falls in love with her. Eventually she starts trusting in Terrence and her fears succumb the new - and somehow old - love. The movie is supposed to interpret the word "strange" completely different. "Feeling strange" is a definite personal expression. There existence nothing which is "strange". Something which is different to the ordinary, may seem strange to people, but just as long as it is unknown. At the same time the ordinary may seem strange to the extraordinary. Suddenly it's not strange anymore. Further more the movie is intended to show that love bears the power to defeat all the fears, everything that's unknown and different brings about.
