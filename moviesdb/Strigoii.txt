Strigoii

 In a town terrorized nightly by a mysterious creature, a visitor comes knocking at the door of Willie and Mary Wallen. Claiming to be a friend, the visitor begs them to open the door. Amos, who was also saved from the outside, tries to keep them from opening the door. Is the visitor a man in danger, or is he something worse?
