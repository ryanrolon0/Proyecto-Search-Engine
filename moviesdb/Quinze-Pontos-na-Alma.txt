Quinze Pontos na Alma

 This is the story of Simone, who falls in love with a stranger in the instant before he jumps to his death. Fate does not expect her to understand, only to quest, for a love, stranger than her own. In a city riddled with mysteries, Simone searches for what she has lost, in an adventure beyond her imagination. She abandons her life in a quest for a imaginary one, becoming first lover, and later, widow.
