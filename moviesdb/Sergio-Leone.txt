This documentary hears testimony from his wife Carla, his scriptwriter Sergio Donati, director of photography Tonino Delli Colli, composers Ennio Morricone and Alessandro Alessandroni, as well as other personalities within the Italian film industry such as Damiano Damiani and Florestano Vancini. Leone's principal works are reconstructed in these interviews, with particular reference to the world famous "Trilogy of Dollars" Fistful of Dollars", "For a few dollars more", "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". The son of a fine Italian silent movies director, Sergio Leone became the most prestigious assistant director in Italy.

He later achieved international recognition for his westerns and the film that kept him budy for the last few years of his life "Once Upon a Time in America".
