The Mini

 A dejected futon salesman competes with a cocky co-worker to win a mini-marathon and score a coveted assistant manager position in the store where they both work. Fran Molon specializes in futons, but everyone in his small town has their mind set on mattresses. With a mini-marathon fast approaching, Fran's colleague suggests that they compete to see who can get the fastest time, and allow the winner to become the new assistant manager. Before long, Fran is training around the clock. Does he possess the drive and endurance to cross the finish line first, or is he forever doomed to be the red-headed stepchild of the furniture business.
