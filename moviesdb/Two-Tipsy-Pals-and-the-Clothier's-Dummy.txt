Two Tipsy Pals and the Clothier's Dummy

 Two rather sporty looking young men are returning home early in the morning. Just outside a clothier's store they become involved in an argument. One young man walks away, and the clothier's dummy is mistaken by the other for the chum that has just left. He goes on arguing with the dummy, and receiving no satisfaction, deals him a blow. They fall to the sidewalk and roll over and over. The dummy is finally thrown through a plate glass window and the offender is arrested.
