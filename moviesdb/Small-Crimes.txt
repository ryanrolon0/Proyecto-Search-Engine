Small Crimes

 Henry Harper can't write left him with only a blank page and a hangover to show for it. His frustration is vented through a series of strange artworks that decorate his untidy flat and, as the dawn breaks over a grey horizon, he starts to question his motivations as a writer. But Henry's examination into the mind of the killer he is trying to create has chilling consequences, as he pushes himself to the edge.
