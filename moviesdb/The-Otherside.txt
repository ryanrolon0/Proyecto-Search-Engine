The Otherside

 Based on a true story from the Western Suburbs of Melbourne and set in 2003, the Otherside is a quaint and fantastic voyage into the world of three generations in an Italian family. Carmello and Vinchenzina are an elderly couple transitioning from old age into death, however it is Roddi the kitten who is best able to understand the quantum leap their souls make as the pair journey into the afterlife that is the Otherside.
