The Myth of the Male Orgasm

 Jimmy Ravinsky, one of three male roommates, participates in a feminist psychology experiment, being interviewed about male attitudes and behaviors regarding sex and romance by an anonymous woman, "Jane Doe." His experiences reflect upon and change his relationships with Mimi, a woman with whom he has a platonic friendship but desires romance, and Paula, a sexy ex-partner who loves to flaunt her new loves. As these change, so does his relationship with "Jane Doe."
