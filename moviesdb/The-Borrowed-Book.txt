The Borrowed Book

 The banker and the town's wealthiest citizen are life-long friends, inseparable until the capitalist, a bookworm, discovers a rare volume and lends it to the banker. A maid in the banker's household takes the book from his study to her room, and, being discharged the next day by her mistress, packs the treasured volume in her trunk before leaving. The incident ruptures the friendship and leads to serious consequences, developing situations which furnish opportunity for some very remarkable acting.
