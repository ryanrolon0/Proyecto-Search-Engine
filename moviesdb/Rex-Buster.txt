Rex Buster

 In the hierarchy of high school Rex Buster is King, but on the first day of his senior year, his status is put to the test when he is faced with the challenge of getting help for a fellow student, which will change the way people see him forever. Rex Buster is the King of Sunset High, a private high school in the suburbs of Los Angeles. His girlfriend, Jennifer, hides her pain of their loveless relationship by playing along with his games. Admired by his three cronies Nick, Mike and Jay, Rex arrives to school on the first day of his senior year with a new "retro rocker" style. In English class, Rex notices a scantily dressed girl, Lynn, which he ends up hooking up with in the janitors closet with shortly after. At lunch he brags that she is still there waiting for him to his friends, who praise him, but Jennifer and her crew of hot girls arrive. Tom Spencer, an awkward student, accidentally bumps into the schools star athlete, Chase, and is humiliated in front of Rex. After school Rex decides to get so beers, but not before Jay persuades him to take "happy pills". On his way back encounters a sullen Tom. The two end up having a beer discussing the truth of their outside persona. Rex offers Tom a happy pill which in turn causes Tom to have a major seizure. Rex, now feeling the effects of the drugs, is faced with the challenge of getting help for Tom. This will change the way people will see him forever.
