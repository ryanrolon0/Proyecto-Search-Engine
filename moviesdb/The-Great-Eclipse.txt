The Great Eclipse

 Filmed in La Paz, Mexico, by the Academy Award winning team of Manuel Arango and Robert Amram, the film shows the eclipse in its entirety including the countdown to Totality, the Diamond Rings, Baily's Beads, and all the other wonders of "the greatest light show on earth." There is a short sequence on the history of eclipse chasing, but more than anything this is a human adventure story about the rich assortment of people who came from all over the world to experience the third largest total eclipse of the century.
