The Land Girls

 During World War II, a new regiment called "Land Girls" was formed in England for recruiting women to work at farms where men left to go to war. Three women of different social backgrounds - quiet Stella, young hairdresser Prue and Cambridge graduate Ag join the Land Girls. It is England in 1941 in the glorious Dorset countryside. Three beautiful young women, Stella, Ag and Prue, arrive on a remote farm. They are the 'Land Girls' - city girls who have volunteered to take the place of young men who have gone to war. They are an unlikely trio sexy; Ag is quiet and more reserved; while the dreamy, beautiful Stella is in love with Philip, a dashing naval officer. Despite their differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war.
