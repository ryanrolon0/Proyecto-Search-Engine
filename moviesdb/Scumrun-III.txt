Scumrun III

 100 cars, 4 countries, 4 days and 2871 miles - That s the Scumrun! Even more madcap antics from the Scumrun rally! Emily Booth joins the rally for a second year as more than 100 teams traverse their way across Europe in vehicles bought for less than 500 quid. This year the teams travel through France aiming for Barcelona, Spain. The Scumrun route is a closely guarded secret until the morning of each new day. Many of the teams traveling in fancy dress ... and anything goes! Join the Ghostbusters, Mighty Worth, Gentlemen s Club and the legendary Holy Rollers as they party across Europe. No flash cars, hotels or champagne - just beer, campsites and scrap motors all in the name of charity.
