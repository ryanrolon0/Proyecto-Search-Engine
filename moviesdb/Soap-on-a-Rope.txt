Soap on a Rope

 Featuring some of the best - thereby the worst (depending on the day) - actors New York City has to offer. Due to their distinct appetites for inspired, experimental projects, and as talented as they are hungry, the recurring cast of the show may also be seen on Broadway and in feature films. "Soap on a Rope" is the culmination of years of practical jokes, juvenile bodily noises, and the never-ending clash of European wit with American hypocrisy.
