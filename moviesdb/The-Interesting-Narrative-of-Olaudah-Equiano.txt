The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano

 England, 1792 At the opening of our film there exists two separate worlds in 18th century Britain - the world of freed slaves living in England, and mainstream society - each containing a small group of characters upon whom we focus the audiences' interest. Our drama consists in the collision of these two worlds that stand in direct opposition to each other.
