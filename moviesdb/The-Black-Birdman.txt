The Black Birdman

 Prior to 1941 the US War Department considered black servicemen to be incapable of piloting aircraft. In response to immense pressure, an experimental flight program was soon constructed in Tuskegee Alabama to train black pilots. One subject of this experiment was James H. Harvey III. He is the Black Birdman.
