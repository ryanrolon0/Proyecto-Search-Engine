Skin Deep in Love

 A slick, womanizing magician and his pretty assistant perform regularly at a hotel cabaret. They are having an affair with each other, as well as with several other employees at the venue. When one waitress spurns the magician's advances, the assistant hypnotizes her so that she will yield to his advances. Complications ensue.
