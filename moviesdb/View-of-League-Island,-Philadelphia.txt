View of League Island, Philadelphia

 "This is a picture of the largest navy yard in the United States, where all the monitors and a number of war vessels were stationed prior to the outbreak of the Hispano-American War. Everyone goes to League Island when in Philadelphia to see the men and machines that are expected to do the fighting for the American Government on the sea. Buy this film if you want a money maker, and you will find an appreciative audience wherever you exhibit it. A fine photographic subject."
