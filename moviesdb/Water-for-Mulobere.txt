Water for Mulobere

 In the summer of 2009, a team of college engineering students helped bring clean drinking water to an African village. As part of an Engineers Without Borders project, the University of Minnesota student group designed, built and installed a solar-powered water supply system for a secondary and vocational school and its surrounding community in Mulobere, Uganda.
