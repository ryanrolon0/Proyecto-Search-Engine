The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch

 It's quiet in Chastity Gulch, a small town in the Wild West. The men of the village are all in the army and fight their battles far away. The women are getting very bored! At once a bunch of robbers drops into the saloon. They love the beer but are also looking for beautiful women. Will the town-whores keep these delightful men for themselves or will the doctors-wife and the mayors-wife also get a part of the fun? During the latter stages of the Civil War, the men in a Southern town leave to fight. Which leaves only the women to take care of the town, which won't since half of the women are the wives of the men who left and the other half are the prostitutes whom their men frequent. Now the madam has brought her recently graduated niece to town to take care of things. She's also a doctor. Now when a band of vile Union soldiers come to town and with less than honorable intentions, it's up to them to try and fend them off. Will they succeed?
