The Wedding Toast

 Happily taking a weekend away from the rat-race of the New York publishing world, Will arrives at his best friend's wedding in the Napa Valley intent on writing the perfect 'toast.' But confronted with his successful friends and his own unfulfilled dreams and failed romances, Will's earnest attempt to capture the essence of love and happiness is quickly derailed when it becomes a referendum on his own life, where it went wrong, and why he didn't notice. His plight is not lost on the bride's sister, Claudia, who tries in vain to clear his head and cut his speech.
