Vilma

 Vilma is a happy nine-year-old girl, who's parents are wacky ant researchers and she takes care of them. One day the parents go on a vacation and forget Vilma and their dog Panda home. Luckily the parents take their vision-phone with them. With a help of her new friend Patu, Vilma puts together another vision-phone and contacts her parents who have landed in a forest to investigate a huge ant nest and Vilma teaches them how to survive in the wilderness.
