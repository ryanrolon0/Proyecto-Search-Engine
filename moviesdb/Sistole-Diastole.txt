Sistole Diastole

 The human heart relaxes and contracts. A family picnics in Xochimilco to celebrate the anniversary of papá and mamá, who are about 60. They meander into a field to make love. Their daughter Carmelita, a novice, prays for a sign tells his mute abuelo that he's going to ask his cousin Nena to marry him; Nena has secrets of her own to share with Victor. Daughter Rosa tells her drunken husband Mundo she wants a divorce. Rosa and Mundo's young son plays a card game with his tía abuelita. It all happens as mariachis sing and the family awaits the drawing of the National Lottery's grand prize. Hearts beat faster.
