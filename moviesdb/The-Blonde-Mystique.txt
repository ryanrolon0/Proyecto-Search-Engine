The Blonde Mystique

 For women, being blond is about more than just having a head of fair hair. Today, as throughout history, there is a prevailing mystique about being blond. Envied, reviled, lusted after, joked about, blonds are magnets for their allure, yet mocked for their supposed lack of intelligence. Are blonds truly perceived by others as sexier, younger, and more adventurous than women with differently colored locks? How much of the image of blonds is founded, and how much is fiction? In THE BLONDE MYSTIQUE, brunettes Angela Case and Karen Holness and blond Aubrey Arnason team up on a quest into the heart of blondness, setting out to discover for themselves if there really is such a thing as a blond mystique and, if so, exactly what it is. Seeking information and answers, the trio uncover details about blonds throughout history, and the booming business in making the unblond blond....and the blond even blonder. They do field research to see if blonds are treated differently from their non-blond counterparts, questioning men on their preferences in the street, taking to the highway - where our hosts play a damsel in distress with a broken down car, and on a night out at the clubs. And then the ultimate test Aubrey will each change her hair color. The brunettes become blonds and the blond a brunette to see what life is like on the other side of the peroxide bottle, and whether being blond actually colors not just others' perception of you, but your own view of yourself.
