Tarana

 A young doctor returning home from abroad is stranded in a village as his plane develops trouble and crashes. He meets and falls in love with a beautiful local village girl, who happens to be the daughter of his blind host. The romance is not looked upon by the villagers, especially one particular villager who is courting her himself. He hatches a plot to drive the doctor out of the village and in the process defiles the girl's character. The lovers are separated and the doctor, due to a misleading event, believes his sweetheart to be dead and resigns himself to a dejected life and a loveless marriage. The girl, meanwhile, loses her father in a fire, and sets out in search of her separated lover. Dedicated city-based Dr. Motilal continues to work even on the day of his marriage, and reflects on the past few months of his life - including his journey by airplane, which crash-lands near a small community. His meeting with beautiful Tarana, who lives with her blind father, Surdas, leads to romance much to the chagrin of Toteram, who is all set to wed her. Circumstances will propel Motilal to live in this community, while his father, Diwan, along with his future daughter-in-law, Sheela, and her dad, also journey there - not knowing that the local Panchayat has blacklisted Motilal for his alleged hand in the pregnancy of Tarana.
