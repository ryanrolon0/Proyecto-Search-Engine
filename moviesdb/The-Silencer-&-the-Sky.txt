The Silencer & the Sky

 "A lost and estranged ex-military sniper turned mercenary for an unscrupulous company finds solace, hope, and possibility in choosing to protect a deaf child during a mission to assassinate her, making him a rogue agent determined to find safety for his new counterpart, while delivering a very important invention for a friend indebted to him for protecting his family in a past war."
