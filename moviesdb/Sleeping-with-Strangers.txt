Sleeping with Strangers

 Daniel is in danger of losing his inn after another more modern establishment opens next door and steals his guests. He goes to the bank for a loan, but they tell him to hope for a miracle. Then a limo pulls up carrying the hottest rock star and biggest movie actress around. The two inns compete for these prestigious guests, Daniel trying to save his inn, the other man (Mark) trying to drive Daniel out of business for good (and steal his fiancee).
