Wallace & Gromit in The Wrong Trousers

 Plasticine animation of the loveable duo of Wallace and Gromit; inventors of all manner of useful devices. In this Oscar winning story, Gromit (a dog) finds himself being pushed out of his room and home by a new lodger who is actually a ruthless criminal (and a small penguin). The penguin is planning a robbery and needs to use Wallace and his mechanical remote controlled trousers to pull off the raid. However, Gromit is wise to the penguin and comes to the rescue. A must see for all ages.
