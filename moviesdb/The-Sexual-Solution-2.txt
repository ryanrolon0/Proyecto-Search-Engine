The Sexual Solution 2

 As the story continues, seedy P.I. Jack Rom is trapped in a fortified mansion owned by a corrupt millionaire collector who has stolen a sexual potion from Rom's chemist client. Around every corner, Rom has a decision to make, left or right, up or down, right or wrong, which can lead to recovery of the potion, or sexual gratification, or sudden death.
