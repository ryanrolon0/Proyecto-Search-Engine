Saradapan

 Shoko, a young female college student, is going abroad to work as a voluntary worker, but her mother keeps refusing her petition. Time passes and it's already the day before her flight. Set in a nicely old-fashioned, family-run bakery, this film tells a story of the people who truly care for their family but struggle to understand each other.
