Santa Ana Winds

 The Santa Ana Winds dramatically alter life in Southern California, blowing in hot, dry wind from the desert to the east and ratcheting up temperatures, enhancing fires, and instilling a general unrest in this otherwise idyllic climate. It is against this backdrop that we join Jason and Claire on their way to the notoriously chaotic Los Angeles International Airport. The two have been together in Los Angeles for three years, but a new job is taking Claire to New York. They've spent weeks sorting out the particulars of their breakup, but as they're stuck in traffic in the heat, Jason has a change of heart. Claire wants to stay the course and make her plane. What follows is a hectic juggling of emotions as the two of them make their way through the airport, encountering confusingly named airlines, bubbly flight attendants, and unpredictable weather, all while Jason tries to get Claire to stay with him.
