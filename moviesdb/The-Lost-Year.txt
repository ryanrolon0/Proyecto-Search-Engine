The Lost Year

 The Lost Year tells the story of my journey from meth-addicted rave DJ to responsible parent of triplet daughters. It also tells the parallel story of my father, a professional gambler whose secret family came to light after he died in a horrific car accident he caused while drunk driving. As I ponder what it means to be a father, especially to triplet girls, I'm forced to confront my own womanizing past and the huge shadow my father has cast over my life.
