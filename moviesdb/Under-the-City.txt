Under the City

 Follows the attempted redemption of Nate Mayott, a semi-reformed, thirty year-old, ex-con with a dark past trying to rebuild his family and maintain his freedom who is thrust into the violent underworld of the Chicago sex trade- where anything can be bought or sold if the price is right and the demand is there. Which it is. Piece by piece, Nate sells his soul for freedom until he is finally backed into an impossible corner and must kidnap an innocent little girl in order to save his own. Under The City's central focus is love, self-realization and the frightening prospect that the vulnerability needed to fall in love can be more terrifying than facing a loaded gun, and how the desire to have a "normal life", for some, is pure fantasy.
