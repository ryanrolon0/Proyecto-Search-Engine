Vol-au-vent

 It's Samantha's big wedding day but her mother is making it miserable for her with a typical maternal conflict of interests. Her mother orders her the wrong flowers, the wrong type of make-up and wants to video the garden instead of the girls getting dressed. To top it off three thieves have crashed the party pretending to be video-assistants, the make-up artist gets drunk and the chauffeur has choked on a biscuit and died.
