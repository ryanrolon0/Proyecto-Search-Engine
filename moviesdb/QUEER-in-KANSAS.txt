QUEER in KANSAS

 QUEER in KANSAS is an autobiographical self-portrait of the artist and filmmaker Peter Max Lawrence. It uses disparate elements from the traditional narrative, experimental cinema and performance art documentation to paint a larger picture of the struggles facing a young closeted Midwestern artist in the Nineteen-Nineties.
