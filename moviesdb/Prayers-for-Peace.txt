Prayers for Peace

 Prayers for Peace is a narrative stop-motion animation confronting the memory of the animator's younger brother killed in the current conflict in Iraq. Drawn entirely with pastels on a slate chalkboard, the materials used to create the animation become a metaphor for the impermanence of life.
