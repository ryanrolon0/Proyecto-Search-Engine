Railroadin'

 The Our Gang kids are playing around the train yard where Joe's father works. Exploring one of the trains, they suddenly find themselves hurtling down the tracks with no engineer or other adults aboard. Only Farina escapes from the train, but he gets his foot caught in the tracks, directly in front of the speeding locomotive.
