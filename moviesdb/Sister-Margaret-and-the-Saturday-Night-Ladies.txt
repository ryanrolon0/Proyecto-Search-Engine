Sister Margaret and the Saturday Night Ladies

 A catholic nun tries hard to protect and integrate in society a number of young women with a past in reform schools or even prisons. Lack of funds, troublemakers in the group, outside incomprehension for her aim make her task hard, but eventually she achieves due to her faith in God, and the human person.
