Shanty Town Show Down

 In a post-apocalyptic world, in the ruins of a cityscape much like ours, the last remnants of humanity bicker for power beneath the ash filled skies that slowly suffocate them. On the edge of town, sheltered in a derelict building, street urchin Caine hustles and steals to support his sickly mother. Following a confused and bungled theft, Caine arrives home one afternoon with a valuable industrial prototype drug, mistakenly believing it to be milk. Assassins arrive in pursuit shortly afterwards. Beaten and incapacitated, Caine watches helplessly as his mother is executed in retribution, and vowing vengeance, he escapes into the unknown depths of the city, a broken man. Aided by a beautiful girl he meets along the way, Kaya, he takes refuge in a Shanty Town huddled amidst the polluted heart of the city. She lives with her mentally unstable brother, Tom, leader of the small community. They know too well the value of the substance Caine stole and more importantly, of the organization who pursue him!
