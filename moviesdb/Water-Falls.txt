Water Falls

 Michaels is a veteran CIA agent, trained as a special operations interrogator. Stationed at an underground CIA detention facility, Michaels must now use his experience and training in "enhanced interrogation techniques" (particularly water boarding) to extract vital information from a prisoner. When the interrogation process goes awry, Michaels must reconcile with himself and his chosen profession.
