The Peace of Roaring River

 Madge Nelson is ordered, for health reasons, to move to the countryside, but her finances do not permit her to make the move from the city. Therefore, she answers an advertisement for a mail-order bride for miner Hugo Ennis in Nevada. Ennis, however, is the unwitting victim of an attempt at humiliation by a scorned lover, and Madge arrives in Nevada only to learn that Ennis knows nothing about the new bride or any wedding plans.
