Rags

 After trying to live the American dream, Alice returns to a Wonderland of crystal-meth. Her new family consists of characters straight from the March Hare's tea party; a dysfunctional crew consisting of an insane pimp, a worn out prostitute, and a lethargic burnout. As their lives spiral further into darkness and the past seeks retribution, all will pay the ultimate price for what was lost down the rabbit hole.
