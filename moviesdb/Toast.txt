Toast

 What happens to a peaceful market trader after secret agents and evil henchmen have destroyed his stall in the course of a car chase? In a small Yorkshire town Andy Westow has his eye on entrepreneurial glory. His neighbour, Phoebe Fangdale, has her eye on Andy. Nearby, in his moorland hideaway, Julian Wiley has his eye on world domination. And local secret agent James Buttercrambe is bored with saving the world week in and week out. If they're not careful, all sorts of things could go wrong. This short film is both a plea for agents and henchmen to drive more considerately when undertaking car chases and also a shocking insight into the possible consequences of sharing a few slices of toast with your neighbour.
