The Last Miracle

 Michael Lazarus is a single parent. His wife died and he's raising his ten year old son, Andy. He's a workaholic and becomes more and more dependent on his two sisters, Mary and Martha, for help with Andy. The stress finally takes its toll. Disaster hits this family and it's their faith in God and strong belief that "God has a plan" that gets them through it. Their love for one another and their love for God bring us to the dramatic conclusion of this film.
