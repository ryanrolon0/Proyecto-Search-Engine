 You don't need a dream-come-true story to keep dreaming on and on and on. For some people, life is always about expectation, expecting something new, expecting changes. There are plenty of possibilities for your expectation. Obstacles and pleasures both would be on the way to something you are perusing. While the outcome may be a bubble, it could be the warm-up for the next journey.
