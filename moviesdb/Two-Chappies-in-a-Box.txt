Two Chappies in a Box

 Two dudes are seated in the box at a vaudeville theatre. An actress is on the stage doing her turn, and the chappies endeavor to make a "hit" with her. They have a bottle of wine, and after taking two glasses, stand the bottle on the front of the box. In their excitement, they knock the bottle over and ruin the draperies on the front of the box. This is discovered by the management, and they are put out of the place in a hurry.
