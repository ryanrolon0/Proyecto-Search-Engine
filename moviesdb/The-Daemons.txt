 Max Seher is waging a war. His enemies are Demons, which he can sense all around him. He cannot actually see them. But their souls charge the air around them with electricity; the sky darkens visibly and they become perceptible. Max knows that there are people among us who are possessed by demons; they are the enemy in his war. He knows that he has allies in his struggle, and he can only see their activities through the TV. Max begins to exorcise demons by sneaking up on the people possessed by them and injecting them with a special fluid. One day he notices a strange woman in front of a Cathedral, trying to get in, but not quite able to pass the gates of this holy house of the lord...
