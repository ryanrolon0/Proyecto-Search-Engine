Sri Raam Vanavas

 After returning to Ayodhya from Mithila with his new bride Sita, Ram is banished to the forest for fourteen years by his stepmother so his half-brother can rule the kingdom. During their forest exile, Ram's wife is abducted by demon King of Lanka Ravan. With the help of his brother Lakshman and an army of monkeys, Ram declares war on Lanka to win back his bride. Ayodhya's Maharaj Dashrath wants to crown his eldest of four sons, Bhagwan Shri Ram. This does not auger well with devotees tormented by Ravanji and other demons, and they rush to Brahmadev, who re-directs them to Devi Maa Saraswati. Through Devi Saraswati's indirect incitement, Manthra, a lowly servant in Maharani Kaikeyi's palace, manages to instigate her against Dashrathji. Kaikeyiji asks for two boons 14-years, and the second to crown her son, Bharatji, as Maharaj. A visibly traumatized Dashrath refuses. When Shri Ram finds out, he decides to carry out his step-mother's wishes. Accompanied by Sitaji and his brother, Lakshmanji he sets off for his exile - setting off a chain of events that will result in his father's death; Bharat's refusal to ascend the throne; Sitaji's abduction and subsequent forcible confinement in Lanka by Ravanji; the setting-up of a Vanar army led by Sugreevji and Bhagwan Shri Hanuman; and the epic battle between Ramji and the ten-headed immortal Shivbhakt Ravan.
