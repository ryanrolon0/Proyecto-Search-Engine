Porky's Hero Agency

 Porky is reading the myth of the Greek gorgon, who turned everyone she looked at into stone. Mother tells him it's bed time; he dreams of being the hero that saves Greece, Porkyakarkus. The Gorgon runs a photo studio; Porky sneaks in and grabs her life-restoring needle, saving civilization just before he wakes up.
