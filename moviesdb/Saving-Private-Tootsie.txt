Saving Private Tootsie

 Inspired by a real-life event in December 1998, this action-packed comedy follows a group of Katoeys (ladyboys) caught in a border dispute after their plane crashes. A group of six straight soldiers reluctantly takes on a mission to save them- but first they must attempt to cast aside their personal prejudices in order to tackle the task.
