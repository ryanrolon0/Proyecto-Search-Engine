The Recruits

 Many answer the call but few can resist the intense regimen this rather sadistic army official has in store for his new recruits. He needs a few good men and no second best won't do. Follow them as they try to give their best and train hard to become good soldiers while still enjoying sexual trysts with each other. With a cast including many stars from the famous Falcon stable of men like the very well-endowed Brad Patton and the prolific Matthew Rush, this production offers exciting adventures, hard work and sensual pleasures all rolled into one. The few chosen are proud and ready to get the ball rolling and offer their very best assets.
