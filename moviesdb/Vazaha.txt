Vazaha

 Shot over 16 days while driving across Madagascar, the film provides a broad look at the varied landscapes, towns, villages and cities that make up the diverse island nation, lensed through a discussion on language, place, otherness and culture. Eschewing a traditional voice over, the film instead uses aural collages from ambient audio, music and found sound.
