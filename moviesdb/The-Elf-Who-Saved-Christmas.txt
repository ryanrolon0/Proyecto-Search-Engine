The Elf Who Saved Christmas

 "The Elf Who Saved Christmas" begins on Christmas Eve when Santa has received no letters in his giant mailbox. Santa calls the elves together and announces that no one believes in the spirit of Christmas anymore. It is time for him to retire. Toby, the tiny mailroom elf, sets out to find the letters and tumbles through the mailbox into the den of the wicked Mrs. Buzzard (Jo Anne Worley), who has put a spell on the mailbox to ruin Christmas. At the climax of the story, Toby turns to the camera and asks the children for help. Soon all the letters come pouring back, and Christmas is saved.
