The Man Who Cuts the Sunday Roast

 Holland,1950. Julia and Hendrick Wendell are happily married. Their 6 year old son is off to school when Julia learns the terrible news of her husband's death, which leaves Julia and her son not only left with little money but also with little support from their conservative family and friends. They want for Julia to find herself a new man, who will provide for his family. When grief and hurt consume Julia, she finds herself seeking consolation from a stranger. When this stranger sees ways to take advantage of his new position within the broken family, Julia is forced to find a brutal way out. The story is about the struggle and strength of a young woman in the early 50's. We found ourselves challenged to create a periodical film. Going back in time, when the entire cast and crew, or their parents, were not even born yet, has been an interesting journey. We felt we had to share this story, not for a political reason, nor for the support of feminism, but for the reason to proof that young filmmakers with passion for a story can create a stunning short film, even without the financial support from funding bodies. We believe in this film, even when others did not, and therefore it should be shared with the public.
