Väter

 Marco and Melanie, a young married couple, are living a life of passion, with chaotic situations, and all the little frustrations of daily life. Their love for each other is like a beacon in the storm. But career pressure, burned toast and dirty laundry erode any feelings of tenderness, and they never seem to find enough time for their six-year-old son, Benny. Their world is about to fall apart when Melanie moves out, taking Benny with her. She files for divorce, and Marco makes a decision that will change all their lives. It is as if he has suddenly discovered his love of fatherhood.
