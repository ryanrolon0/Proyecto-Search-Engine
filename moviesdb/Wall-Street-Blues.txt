Wall Street Blues

 Edgar hears that his oil stock has been called in at $75 a share, but his wife tells him she used the certificates to paper the den in their old house. Edgar and his brother-in-law go to the old house and saw out the wall section with the stock certificates. When they go to the broker's office, Edgar is informed that the called stock was the preferred, and his is the common.
