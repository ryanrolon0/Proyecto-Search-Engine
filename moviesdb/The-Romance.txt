The Romance

 At the Cliff Villa, Miss Brown and her maiden aunt were finding life anything but the beautiful pastime that the architectural and horticultural beauties bespoke for those fortunate in life to be able to command such comforts. On the contrary things were growing so monotonous to Laura Brown that she sought for and found enjoyment in tantalizing her aunt, upon whom Dame Fortune had never smiled long enough to make her either attractive or wealthy. When the scion of a wealthy family made his debut in the circle of acquaintances that forms this very interesting portrayal, matters were not prospering as as well as could be desired until idleness of mind led Miss Brown into mischief that led up to the unraveling of a beautiful romance.
