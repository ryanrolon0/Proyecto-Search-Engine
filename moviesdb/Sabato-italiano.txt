Sabato italiano

 Saturday night in Rimini. Roberto is losing at poker, and he ignores his young Parisian girlfriend, Danielle. She leaves, asking Ricky, a mechanic and friend of Roberto's, to take her to the airport. She then goes to great lengths to get Ricky's romantic attention. Two kids, meanwhile, hire Marina, a stripper, to perform at an abandoned house for their school mates who pay for the show. Some mothers break it up, and Marina and the kids head into the night to escape police. Two young men, Nicola and Enzo, have come to town to find Nicola's ex-girlfriend, who wants nothing to do with them. At a club, they pick up two drugged-out women. The three groups are set to collide.
