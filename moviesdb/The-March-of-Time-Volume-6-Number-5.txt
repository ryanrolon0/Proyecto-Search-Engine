The March of Time Volume 6 Number 5

 Part of the March of Time series, this episode (Volume 6, Number 5) from December 1939 focuses on the potential risks and growing conflict in the Far East. While much of the USA is focused on the war raging in Europe (which the US had yet to join) it is noted that the Japanese invasion of China has caused far more deaths to date. It describes Japan as a major military force in the region and focuses on the danger it places on the British in Hong Kong for example. It correctly predicts that those British forces in the region would be unlikely to withstand an attack in force by the Japanese as they can no longer rely on getting additional troops and Naval vessels given Britain's commitment in the European theater. American bases in the region are then reviewed including Guam, where the entire island is administered by the U.S. Navy and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii which, they claim, will be impenetrable by 1942.
