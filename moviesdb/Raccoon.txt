Raccoon

 In 1956, in the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee, 12 year old Romy Asherton witnessed the brutal murder of her father. The mysterious circumstances surrounding the crime are the reason it's held such interest and become almost folklore. The child insisted a talking Raccoon she'd befriended years earlier had committed the crime. And today, fifty years later, the old woman, dying of cancer and residing in an insane asylum, still insists her story is fact--not myth.
