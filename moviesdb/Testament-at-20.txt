Testament at 20

 Interviews with crew and cast look back 20 years to the filming and release of "Testament" in 1983. Like the 1959 classic "On The Beach", this film focuses on nuclear conflict as it affects a specific group of individuals (in this case, a mother and her children) rather than as a display of destruction and heroics to the general populace. Excellently done.
