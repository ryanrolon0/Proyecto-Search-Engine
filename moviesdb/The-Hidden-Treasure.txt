The Hidden Treasure

 Bill Binks sold his ranch and came home in high glee, carrying the currency, for Bill didn't believe in banks. Bill tried to think of an unusual place to hide that currency and finally hit upon an old pair of boots, then Bill betook himself off without saying a word to his faithful helpmate. Puddlefoot Pete, awakening from a delightful slumber beneath the sheltering side of a barrel, stretched himself and made his way to the "eats." Repeated knocks at Bill's door so incensed Bill's wife that in desperation that she hurled half the articles from the kitchen at poor Pete and wound up with the boots. Getting into the boots, Pete found a giant stack of bills. Recovering from his faint, he set out upon the task of making the world happier, and incidentally spreading Bill's bills wherever there seemed no joy. He hired an automobile and set for a restaurant. What Pete did to the chicken and the sugar is a scream. With a full stomach he hailed forth once more and seeing a woman grinding an organ fell to dancing, much to the happiness of all concerned. He left a small package of bills behind him and sailed forth in quest of all sorts of funny adventures. Passing a grocery store, Pete stopped dead. Perspiration broke out in great beads on his forehead, for there staring at him in the face was 40 boxes of soap, neatly arranged on the store front. Pete didn't hesitate. Calling an express wagon, he paid for the soap and personally saw it taken to the wharf. Then he carefully piled it up and made one grand plunge into the middle of it, and thus did Pete get back at an old enemy. He wound up the day in a remarkable manner. Out of a new building, friends carried an injured workman. Pete followed them sadly home. To the wife he gave what remained of the money, and after a brief interval of desperate misery, struck up a tune and went back to sleep on his lumber pile.
