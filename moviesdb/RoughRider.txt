Roughrider

 In a border town overrun with drug violence, a young gunslinging skateboarder named Jack Urban is out to avenge the murder of his kid sister - killed by a drug cartel leader known only as "The King." Up against ruthless street gangs and corrupt officials, Jack will skate and destroy his way through bustling streets and concrete ditches, becoming the folk hero known to the town as the "Roughrider."
