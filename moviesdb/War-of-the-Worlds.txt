War of the Worlds

 Interviews with the cast and other red carpet arrivals at the London premiere of War of the Worlds. The whole of Leicester Square Gardens in the centre of the square was dressed up to look like the ensuing chaos of an alien invasion, complete with actors running around frantically asking for help and warning others, upside down cars, damaged statues and explosions. All the premiere's guests had to walk through this set up before heading in to watch the screening.
