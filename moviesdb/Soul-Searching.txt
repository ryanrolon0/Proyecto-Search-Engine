Soul Searching

 Soul Searching is a short film about a dour by-the-book homicide detective and his energetic new-age partner who are sent to investigate the suspicious suicide of a university professor. It quickly turns into a murder investigation and the detectives each fall in love with a beautiful woman who is a prime suspect in the murder. Walking the thin line between their professional ethics and their desires proves to be difficult for them, especially because everyone seems to have a secret. A sinister man with connections to both women and an undergraduate student with a bad attitude add extra dimensions to the unfolding mystery.
