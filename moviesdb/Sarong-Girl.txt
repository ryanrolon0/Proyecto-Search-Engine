Sarong Girl

 A crusading D.A. orders the police to shut down a South Seas themed girlie show and arrest its participants. The lead dancer eludes jail time when her attorney persuades the judge that she has a (fictitious) elderly mother to take care of. The attorney then scours the local senior homes for a suitably sweet maternal type to fit the bill. At the same time, the dancer seeks her revenge by seducing the D.A.'s ambitious but naive son. But her newly acquired mama eventually exudes some influence on the girl.
