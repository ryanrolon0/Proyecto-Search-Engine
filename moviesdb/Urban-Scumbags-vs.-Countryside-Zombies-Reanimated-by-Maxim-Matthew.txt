Urban Scumbags vs. Countryside Zombies Reanimated by Maxim Matthew

 The Reinhardt Institute, located in the middle of the picturesque Brandenburg countryside, is home to juvenile delinquents from across northern Germany. Drug addicts, schizophrenics and nymphomaniacs share living facilities with a group of militant and highly unorthodox counselors. But when a biological terrorist attack causes the villagers in the town next door to wake from the dead, these misfits are the only ones left who can stop the epidemic... it's a smack down the likes of which the world has never seen, as the Urban Scumbags take on the Countryside Zombies.
