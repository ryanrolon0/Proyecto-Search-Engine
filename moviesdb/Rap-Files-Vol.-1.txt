Rap Files Vol. 1

 "Rap Files" is a video magazine that covers the world of today's urban hip-hop music and culture. It takes you into the culture of hip-hop music and explains the business of the music industry. The "RF" rapumentary (rap-documentary) can be used as a learning tool for upcoming artists, DJ's, Rappers, and Producers in the hip-hop music industry. It goes behind the scenes with entertainers at concerts, studios, freestyle battles, party's and also undercover throughout the industry to discuss rumors, business, and lifestyles. The rapumentary bridges the gap between the fans & artists, artists & labels, and labels & distributors.
