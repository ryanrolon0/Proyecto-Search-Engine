Tweety and the Beanstalk

 Jack's mother throws Jack's magic beans outside under Sylvester Cat's sleeping box, and the cat is whisked to the world above, where he finds a huge Tweety Bird in the castle of the legendary Giant. When he tries to snag Tweety, Sylvester is chased by the Giant down the beanstalk. Sylvester chops down the stalk while the giant is still descending. The Giant falls on top of Sylvester with such force that Sylvester is shot through the Earth to the Orient.
