Song of Revolt

 In 1792, the French army is fighting on an empty stomach. A baron commissions Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle to inspire the troops with a new marching song. He's soon completed the music and lyrics of "Le Marseillaise." We see the revolutionaries adopt the song as their own. To de Lisle's regret, the song he had hoped would bring French unity becomes an anthem for French killing French. He's arrested and his on his way to the guillotine when the procession halts. Can he explain the meaning of the song and escape an early death?
