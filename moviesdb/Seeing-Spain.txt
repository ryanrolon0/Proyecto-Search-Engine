Seeing Spain

 This travelogue visits Granada, Seville, Toledo, and Madrid. In the first three, we see Moorish influences, including the Alhambra, bridges, and a cathedral that began as a mosque. In Seville, we also watch six young women dance to guitar music. In Toledo, an old city that became a haven for Jews from Jerusalem, we visit the home of El Greco and watch artisans make souvenirs for tourists. In Spain, the narrator notes that the physical scars of the 1936-39 civil war are mostly gone. We conclude with views of four of the capital city's monuments.
