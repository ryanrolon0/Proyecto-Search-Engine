Unloosened and Root

 A 'Viking funeral' in New Orleans, a colonoscopy searching for cancer, a lonely campground that leads to the brink of consciousness; 'Unloosened and Root' deftly exploits multiple film genres to tell a singular tale of mourning and loss. An intimate, elegiac motion picture that does nothing less than re-imagine death's rituals for a new generation of the chronically mortal.
