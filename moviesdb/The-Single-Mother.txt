The Single Mother

 Meet The Single Mother - a big hearted reincarnation of June Cleaver, who embarks on a perilous journey to obtain the nuclear family featured in his tattered Home & Garden magazines. With the unfortunate predicament of being unable to conceive himself (but not for lack of trying), he pursues increasingly desperate means to procure a child of his own. When anatomy gets in the way of destiny... the oven mitts are off.
