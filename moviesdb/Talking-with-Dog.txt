Talking with Dog

 In a post-global warming future, mankind has suffered the wrath of mother nature and woman has suffered the inability to have children. Time has stood still for two, small communities. The consequences of global-warming, the lack of fuel, power and communication, have left them in isolation. Dying has become an industry, a woman able to give birth, now only a dream. Into this environment, a young man arrives. He is able to communicate with the dead, able to learn secrets of the past. Because of his presence, the two communities learn that love, in a dying world, is still alive and that there is always hope, even over greed.
