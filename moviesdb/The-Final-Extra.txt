The Final Extra

 The alert atmosphere of a large-city newspaper office and its giant presses combines with the back-stage atmosphere of the theatre, set against the sinister shadow of a bootleg gang and the glitter of a big musical comedy "first night" in a whirlwind of dramatic action. A hot-shot newspaper reporter and a Broadway show-girl provide the romance.
