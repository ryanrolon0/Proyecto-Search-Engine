Rhea Gall Force

 Years after the war against the Solnoids, the descendents of the Earth heroes have created their own crisis. After World War III breaks out and practically annhilates each side, their own weapons, which were derived from an ancient alien ship found on the moon, literally turn against them. Now, the humans are in a losing war against the machines who are out to exterminate them. In this time of seemingly certain doom, we focus on the trials of young soldiers as they play their part in one last effort for their species to leave Earth and survive.
