Sports Illustrated Behind the Scenes

 A popular, but tame, made-for-cable-TV behind-the-scenes look at the making of the 1992 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Features candid moments with the models and supermodels that made the magazine famous, interviews with photographers and editors, and lots of shots of half-clad women rolling around in the sand and surf.
