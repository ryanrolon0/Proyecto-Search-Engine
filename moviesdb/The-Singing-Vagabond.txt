The Singing Vagabond

 Humiliated by her Aunt Hortense, Lettie Morgan runs away from home. Mixing with a troupe of show girls, led by Otto, she is mistaken for the expected leading lady and heads for California with their wagons. They miss the main wagon train and are attacked just as they cross the California border, but are rescued by Captain Tex Autry and his troop. Lettie believes Tex has been insolent for condemning the show troupe being on their own unprotected, and reports him to Colonel Seward at Fort Henry. Horses are stolen from the fort that night by renegades led by Buck LaCrosse and Utah Joe, and when Tex goes in pursuit, he is believed to be a traitor, captured and condemned to death. Judge Lane, in on the plot and hankering for Lettie, is asked by Lettie to intercede, but he double-crosses her. Aided by his pals, Frog and Buffalo, Tex escapes and takes after the wagon train with which Lettie and the troupe of show girls has gone. When a wagon train of a musical troop heading west is attacked, they are saved by Autry's Singing Vagabonds. With the troop safely at an Army post, Utah Joe releases the camps horses and blames Autry. With Autry locked up, Utah Joe now leads the troop's wagon train on westward and into an ambush planned by him and his Indian friends.
