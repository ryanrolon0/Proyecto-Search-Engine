The Rangers

 Starting out as a dance crew, The Ranger$ began posting up their Jerk videos to Youtube and the craze that is Jerk Music thus began. With their channel being viewed over 8 million times, the argument can easily be made that the video featuring their Jerk moves to the tune of the New Boyz "You're a Jerk!" helped the movement break the glass ceiling. Very few hip hop fans and critics remember that there are 4 elements of Hip Hop. Rapping, DJing, Graffiti and Dancing. In the midst of the gangsta movement that catapulted Hip Hop into the next realm, several of the elements seemed to fall on the wayside. Until the last few years, Hip hop dancing had yet to be embraced once again by the masses. Enter Jerk Music. Front and center of the movement, is the multi-talented super crew "The Rangers" with "Jerkin' Is A Habit". The Rangers prove that they are as talented as rapping as they are at dancing. They are documented as they record their first studio album and show what Jerkin' is all about.
