Rose of Cimarron

 A white red-haired girl has been raised by the Cherokee Indians after her family was massacred. She considers herself a Native American and she regards all whites as her enemies. Her feelings are justified when outlaws kill her Indian parents. Realizing she can't seek vengeance alone; she grudgingly accepts the help of white marshal Hollister and is now called the 'Rose of Cimmarron'.
