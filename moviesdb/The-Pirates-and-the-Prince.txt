The Pirates and the Prince

 Artoo, Threepio and a broken down android are traded into the hands of young miner Jann Tosh. The android turns out to be an alien with amnesia and a price on his head. It is in fact Mon Julpa, prince of Tammuz-an, who has been put in this predicament by the power hungry vizier Zatec-Cha. Jann, the droids, and a female freight pilot named Jessica Meade help Julpa claim his throne, battle the Pirates of Tarnoonga and settle a dispute with Tammuz-an clan leader Lord Toda.
