Walk of Shame

 When Sid wakes up from the drunken haze of a night out, he discovers he has a black eye, a strange girl in his flat and absolutely no recollection of the events of the night before. With the help of his bemused and sarcastic flatmate, Sid attempts to piece to together the events of the previous night. Combining a docu-drama style with a light witty script, Walk of the Shame is a short about the mystery of the aftermath of a night out.
