Randrops

 Just prior to the release of Duane Andrews' 3rd instrumental album, 'Raindrops', he and his team shot this 10 minute documentary to talk about his vision and musical progression. This doc offers insight into the music of guitarist Duane Andrews and the formulation of his inimitable style inspired by Django Reinhardt, gypsy jazz, traditional Newfoundland music and that of the Portuguese sailors who visited the port city that was Duane's hometown, plus a classical music education in Canada and France. With the stunning St. Phillip's, NL (near St. John's) as a backdrop, the video takes the viewer to the very studio where the album was recorded, looking over the Atlantic Ocean. Duane talks about the origins of his unique sound, and then travels to the Toronto release of 'Raindrops' at Hugh's Room, and culminates in a gorgeous collaboration with the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra.
