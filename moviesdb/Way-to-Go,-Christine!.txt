Way to Go, Christine!

 Christine is a 20 something female who suffers through the days in her cubicle office job. Her only relief comes from her two 15 minute breaks she received on a daily basis. On those breaks, Christine sprints to the liquor store where she buys 40 ounces of malt liquor. Returning to work is more of a challenge as she not only has to sprint but also chug the alcohol. The boss in the office is onto Christine and he checks in with looking to catch her just one minute late for an excuse to fire her.
