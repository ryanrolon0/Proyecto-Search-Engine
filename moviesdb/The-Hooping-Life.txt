The Hooping Life

 For perhaps the first time in recorded history, a kid's toy, the hula-hoop, is spearheading an explosive subculture. Crossing cultural borders, from South Central to South Africa, THE HOOPING LIFE chronicles the lives of a dozen passionate "hoopers" who overcome difficult circumstances to invigorate their communities. Hooping emerges as a vibrant affirmation of art, stirring hope for the disenfranchised. THE HOOPING LIFE celebrates artistic expression as a way to transcend one's own limitations, and as a means of inclusion. Beyond the pure fascination of watching jaw-dropping moves, hooping is ultimately about taking the risk to follow your dreams, even if they involve something as seemingly insignificant as a hula-hoop.
