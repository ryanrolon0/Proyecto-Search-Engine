UFOs and the Alien Presence

 World renowned UFO author and researcher Michael Lindemann presents the facts on how the government has worked to shape the public view about UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Now referred to as the "spin factor," we find that our current views are based on sensationalistic Hollywood propaganda. Government deception, secret underground bases, unexplained cattle mutilations, secret advanced technology and alien abductions are just a few of the many topics covered in this intelligently researched program exposing the misinformation and the facts behind the truth. The presentation is not slanted in any direction, and the director (Marty Thomas) framed the documentary with a unique, fast paced style. The real photos and film clips (over 500) are strange and fascinating.
