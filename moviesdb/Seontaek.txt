Seontaek

 The movie is based upon the true story of Kim Seon-myung, a communist who steadfastly refuses to recant his beliefs and becomes the world's longest-serving political prisoner of conscience in South Korea. He undergoes torture, starvation and humiliation at the hands of his captors, yet says true freedom is being able to maintain your integrity and conscience.
