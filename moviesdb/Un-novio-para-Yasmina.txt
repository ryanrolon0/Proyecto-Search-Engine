Un novio para Yasmina

 Lola loves weddings, even though her marriage is on the rocks and she suspects that her fiancE Jorge, has fallen in love with Yasmina. Yasmina is in a hurry to get married to Javi, a policeman who prefers to take his time. Alfredo is against the marriage, but would be ready to get married for friendship...or for money.
