Vampyre Compendium

 A tall, pale figure in a black cloak gets into the bedroom of a young lady, ready to attack. But things are not exactly what they look like... This short film is an ironic take on classic vampire stories and makes fun of the stereotypes of the genre through settings and atmospheres reminiscent of old-school Hammer movies.
