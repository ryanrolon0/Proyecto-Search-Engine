Spare Change

 Jerry Silver, an unassuming businessman out on a lunch break, happens upon a mysterious, metallic cube. The cube speaks and politely asks him to insert any coins he has on his person into the cube. As he inserts his loose change, the cube informs him of the mechanism's internal capacity, which is nearing one-hundred percent. Only by inserting more coins will Jerry learn the cube's secret. Untold hours of frustration and hundreds of dollars later, Jerry discovers the true price of acquiescing to the cube's wishes.
