The Divide

 Kobi (19), is about to get an excellence award in his Training Completion ceremony at the Army. His Family live in a Settlement near Nablus, and oppose serving in the IDF. During his weekend visit, Kobi invites his family to the Ceremony. To his surprise, he finds out that his family will be evacuated and his house is intended for destruction, as the army will come to dismantle the settlement as part of the peace process. Kobi must choose between his family and his ideal of serving in the army.
