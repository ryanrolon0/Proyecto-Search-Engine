The Egg

 'The Egg' is a glimpse into suburban Australia. Set within the humble sport of greyhound racing the mockumentary follows owner/trainers Wayne Kingston and Janelle (and Jack) Mount in the lead-up to Australia's biggest dog race - the Golden Easter Egg. Through their contrasting personalities emerges a truly Australian comedic tale of suburbia and the small man's pursuit of modest glory. Both owner/trainers have dogs entered in 'the Egg', and the film depicts their personal tensions in the week of the big race. While both can be labeled 'Aussie battlers' Wayne's methods contrast with Janelle affections (for her greyhound, but not her husband) and the week culminates in a night of drama at Wentworth Park racetrack.
