The Organization

 After a group of young revolutionaries break into a company's corporate headquarters and steal $5,000,000 worth of heroin to keep it off the street, they call on San Francisco Police Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs for assistance. Tibbs is understandably reticent about helping the radicals, since they broke a number of laws (despite a good cause), but when the group is also accused of a murder it didn't commit, Tibbs decides to go along, but without the police department's knowledge. A small group of ordinary citizens team up to topple over a drug ring called The Organization. They ask Lt. Virgil Tibbs to join as they need his expertise. Lt. Virgil Tibbs is reluctant as they are amateurs and have already committed several crimes in order to stop the organization. Also, in order to help them he must do so without the knowledge of the police department. However, after a colleague suspected to be on the take commits suicide Lt. Virgil Tibbs joins them.
