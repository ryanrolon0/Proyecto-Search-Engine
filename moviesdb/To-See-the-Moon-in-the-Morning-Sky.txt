To See the Moon in the Morning Sky

 Eleven years after escaping the horror of living with an abusive husband, Hanna Lloyd, a single mother of two children, now finds herself struggling to maintain her household after recently losing her job. As a direct result of losing her job, Hanna can no longer afford to keep her daughter, Christine, in college. This only adds more stress to an already strained relationship. Complicating matters, Hanna's spirited mother, Sara, decides to move in with the family. Additionally, Hanna notices that her now eleven year-old son, Ricky, has acquired the gambling ways of his father, whom he has never met. When Ricky finds a bag filled with thousands of dollars in cash, things only get worse. The criminal who initially stole the money discovers the boy has it and now stalks the family and is determined to get the money back---no matter what the cost.
