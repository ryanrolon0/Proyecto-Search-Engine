The Skyscrapers of New York

 The camera is on a boat traveling from Pier 14 toward Battery Park. The North River (now the Hudson), busy with tugs, is in the foreground. The piers, some with liners, some with freight boats, are in the middle, and the city's skyline is in the background. At first, the skyline is mostly spires and a few buildings of six or seven stories. By Pier 5, the skyline is much fuller, with buildings looking to be as high as 20 stories. Past New Pier 1 (United Fruit Company), the skyline begins to clear; then the park comes into view.
