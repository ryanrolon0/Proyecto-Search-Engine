The Daffy Dill

 Neal is so forgetful that he forgets it is his wedding day, and he is in the church as a spectator. Edna, his bride-to-be, spots him and they are married. The bride returns to her home to pack for the honeymoon trip, but Neal, the simpleton of the title, forgets to do so. He does recall that he had meant to propose to Edna, so he calls her up and does so. Later, his new mother-in-law, has had enough and meets him at the door with a shotgun.
