Sharaabi

 Loosely based on Dudley Moore's 'Arthur'. Amithabh plays a spoilt but generous hearted drunk son of an extremely rich and uncaring father. Om Prakash plays the surrogate father and Jaya Pradha provides the romantic liason. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and a peg of brandy instead of a glass milk, Vicky Kapoor, the only son of multi-millionaire industrialist, Amarnath, grows up to be an alcoholic, albeit with a good heart. Amarnath has detached himself completely from Vicky's life, and provides him money in lieu of affection and care, living this to be taken care off by Munshi Phoolchand. Vicky is very resentful of being ignored by his dad in this manner, and leaves no stone unturned to mock and belittle him at every available opportunity. Amarnath hopes to get his son married, but Vicky loves the daughter of a poor blind man, Meena, which is not acceptable to Amarnath. One day Amarnath decides he has had enough and decides to turn Vicky out of his house. He has him sign waivers, and asks him to get out, which Vicky does so. While Vicky is relieved of being freed from his dad's control, the question remains that with no skills at making a living, how is Vicky to survive in a cold-hearted world? Amarnath Kapoor has devoted himself to business and money, in the process he neglect his only son, Vicky, leaving him to be taken care of by Munshi Phoolchand. Finding that he does not get proper attention from his dad, Vicky started to drink alcohol and he does not miss an opportunity to insult his dad. Amarnath would like Vicky to marry into wealth but Vicky does not have any such plans on his mind as he love a poor cabernet dancer, Meena. Amarnath does not approve of this proposal and threatens to throw Vicky out of the house. Now Vicky must either decide to fall in line with his dad's wish or quietly move to the streets.
