Soccer Boys

 Soccer is the most popular sport in Eastern Europe and especially so for our four Ukrainian boys. You?d think that a tough workout at soccer practice would tire them out. Well, think again. At an after-practice party at the local sauna, they really turn on the energy. We should have called this video ?Soccer Boys Go Wild.? Anything goes and we see it all.
