Screen-Play for Three

 Dance film inspired by Paul Claudel's mimeograph Une femme et son ombre. A man dances with a woman who he loved dearly in the past. His pregnant partner confronts him with today. The characters dance in front of and behind a screen, on which they conjure increasingly abstract silhouettes.
