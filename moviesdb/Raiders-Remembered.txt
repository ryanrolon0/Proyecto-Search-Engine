Raiders Remembered

 Known simply as Doolittle's Raiders, these exceptionally brave men of the United States Army Air Force and Navy, flew their B-25 Mitchell bombers off of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) in the first strike against the Japanese home islands in April of 1942. Their lives, their stories and the reunion that has never been attended or taped for public viewing is brought to you here in Raiders Remembered.
