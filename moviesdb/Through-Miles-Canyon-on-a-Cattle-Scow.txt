Through Miles Canyon on a Cattle Scow

 Never has there been made a scenic moving picture that will hold the attention of every one like this subject. Miles Canyon in the Upper Yukon is a box canyon that narrows the river from a quarter of a mile wide, down to 60 feet. It has a drop of 18 feet in a mile and a quarter, and a current of 16 miles an hour. The scows going through the dangerous stretch of water must be steered by large sweeps from front and back, each sweep handled by two men. Our camera was so placed as to show the front sweepers constantly in action, and at the same time to show the rushing, whirling waters striking the black frowning basalt walls and by them dashed back to the center of the current, making a veritable Whirlpool Rapids, which can be navigated in safety only by the most experienced pilots. This is without doubt one of the greatest interest sustaining subjects of natural scenery ever made.
