Slimed

 An atheist park ranger and a bible salesman find themselves in an unlikely partnership, thrown into the wilderness, where they stumble upon a sinister and slimey conspiracy that threatens to destroy not just the woods, but the entire world. Nature is under attack and Ranger Rock Rockerson is ready to shoot someone in the face. Along comes Pepe, a naive Bible salesman who stumbles into Rockerson's twisted maze of financial disaster. Together, they set off into the woods to save Rock's park from government shutdown. On their journey they discover the true meaning of nature, beauty and most importantly - how much they hate each other. But nature has an even bigger problem, and it's going to take you on a roller coaster ride of slime - drenched terror.
