Viet Nam

 Forty years in the making! This is the lifetime work of filmmaker Brian Wizard, and an excellent example of what it takes to weave the vicissitudes of life through film as life unfolds . This video captures the battlefield action of a a day in the life of an Assault Helicopter Company during the Viet Nam War, from the soldiers' point of view. This video takes the viewer through an adventurous return to the battlefield thirty years hence, bringing home a sense of healing. Finally, through narration and song, this video brings the acts of war into historic perspective with Brian Wizard's custom painted combat helmet, and more, as now seen on permanent display within the walls of the Smithsonian Institution's Nat'l Air and Space Museum.
