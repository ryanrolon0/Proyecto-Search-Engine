Thinly Veiled

 Jack and Dorian have been best friends for years, but Jack has secretly been in love with Dorian the entire time. With Dorian moving out of the country, the two spend their last weekend together staying in an old SoHo dance studio, dancing, shaving, and watching porn together. Both fun and bittersweet, Thinly Veiled is an exploration of the fine line between friendship and love.
