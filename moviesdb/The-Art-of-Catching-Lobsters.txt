The Art of Catching Lobsters

 In this extraordinary film shot on the rugged North Cornwall coast, director Jane Darke starts recording her husband Nick's life as a fisherman, beachcomber and playwright. Already recovering from a stroke, Nick is then unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer. From that moment forward, Jane's film captures Nick's attempts to pass on knowledge and experience to his sons, and becomes in the process a profoundly moving and honest account of loss, grief and hope. The Art of Catching Lobsters follows on from the huge success of Nick and Jane's previous film, the award-winning The Wrecking Season. Written and directed by Jane Darke, the film was co-produced by Boatshed Films and Sevenstones Media and received its world premiere on BBC4. Since its initial broadcast, the film has screened at several film festivals and received huge praise from critics and audiences alike.
