Schizein

 About a character ruled by his own paranoia and delusion, by creating what he thinks, his own world. The process of making this film came from a real and personal story; my cousin was diagnostic with Schizophrenia 3 years ago, all the symptoms that came from that ill make me experience emotions and perceptions of life in a different way .I was attracted by all this surreal world that I decide to make a film that would be able not only to show the narrative part but most important show the real emotions and perceptions of a Schizophrenic person.While schizophrenia can be a devastating illness for the people who experience it as well as for their families, it is important to recognize that there is hope. Schizein is about a character "DREW" ruled by his own paranoia and delusion, by creating what he thinks, his own world. Suffering from Schizophrenia becomes the biggest issue for him and his Girlfriend "Suzy". Suzy comes by his apartment one day confronts him with news that confuses and angers her. The man chooses to ignore her at this moment; things will begin to unfold for this man...for better or worse
