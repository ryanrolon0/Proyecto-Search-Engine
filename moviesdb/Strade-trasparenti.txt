Strade trasparenti

 Transparent Roads delivers the physical sensations of a bus trip - it's so realistic it becomes ironic at times - and portrays Brazil's human variety in a series of encounters. The landscapes seen through the windows, the restaurants on the road, the testimonies of common and awfully endearing people are so touching because they don't correspond to the stereotypes we have about this country.
