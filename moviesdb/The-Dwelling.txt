The Dwelling

 The master has knowledge of the house, as the house has knowledge of the master, and that knowing is intimate, unavoidable. Naked and raw, inside our homes - where the outside world is banned and temporarily forgotten - we drop our cloaks. We are safe here, protected. Sheltered from whatever is outside. Unless it's inside.
