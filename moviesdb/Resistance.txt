Resistance

 In this group memoir, eleven men and women, now in their 70s and 80s, recount their battle against the Nazis in Poland, Lithuania, and Belorussia from 1941 to 1945. They chronicle their battle for survival and then for revenge, speak about the almost insolvable dilemmas facing Jewish partisans, and discuss the emotional aftermath following their victory over the Nazis.
