Remembering Arthur

 "Remembering Arthur" is a feature-length documentary about an influential yet little-known Canadian filmmaker. Although the Montreal-born artist's work won many awards and received an Oscar nomination, his life ended tragically in suicide. This intimate portrait explores Lipsett's creative genius and impact on film while illuminating his fascinating life story. The film is directed by filmmaker Martin Lavut, Arthur's closest friend.
