Under My Skin

 The film tells the story of Heather and James, two actors sent into a claustrophobic backstage area as part of an eccentric director's audition process. Each of them has been given an objective to work out in a scene they will present to the director. James' objective is to scare Heather; hers is to deal with whatever James dishes out. Is James' apparent insanity part of the audition, or is Heather trapped in a room with a seriously unbalanced individual? As tensions mount, they truly begin to get under each others' skin.
