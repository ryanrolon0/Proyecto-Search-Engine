The Peyote Road

 The Peyote Road addresses the United States Supreme Court 'Smith' decision, which denied protection of 1st Amendment religious liberty to the sacramental use of Peyote for Indigenous people, one of the oldest tribal religions in the Western Hemisphere. Examining the European tradition of religious intolerance & documenting the centuries old sacramental use of the cactus Peyote, The Peyote Road explains how the Smith decision put religious freedom in jeopardy for all Americans.
