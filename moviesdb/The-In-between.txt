The In-between

 Jared has found himself his first live-in boyfriend, but begins to suspect that the man he is in love with isn't as faithful as he would hope. Has his paranoia got the better of him? Or are his instincts dead on? The second in a trilogy of shorts focusing on the gay community, 'the in-between' explores the challenges, expectations and hope that comes from entering into a monogamous relationship. Continuing in the series' format, 'the in-between' uses documentary audio of gay men discussing their experiences with monogamy, as the film's narration. A drama, a tragedy and a documentary all in one, 'the in-between' crosses many boundaries, both in form and subject.
