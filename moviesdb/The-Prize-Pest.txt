The Prize Pest

 For no apparent reason, Porky Pig is awarded the grand prize of the "What's the Name of Your Name" game show. Unfortunately, the prize is Daffy Duck, whose tactless and rude visit gets him tossed out Porky's house by the irate pig. Insulted, Daffy decides to get back at Porky by pretending to have dissociative identity disorder, becoming a hideous monster whenever he's treated unpleasantly. When Porky eventually finds out he's been had, he decides to give the duck a taste of his own medicine.
