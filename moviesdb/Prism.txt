Prism

 A high school class is taking notes on a geometry lecture. One of the students is disenchanted, and gets a drink of water. As he is about to walk back into class, another student suddenly leaves. The returning student stares into the room. He dreads going back to his desk, so he begins circling the hall. As he walks farther away, he begins to hear the noises of the classroom in his mind. He is disturbed by this occurrence and tries to exit. The student pulls on the door handles, and the noises suddenly stop. A few seconds later, the teacher's lecture blares through the hall. The student rushes back to the classroom. However, as soon as he opens the door, everything is normal. He stands at the entrance in a complete state of shock. After several moments, he regains his bearings and returns to his desk. He is in disbelief but no one in the class is remotely fazed.
