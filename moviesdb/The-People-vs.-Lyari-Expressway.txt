The People vs. Lyari Expressway

 Lyari Expressway is the largest urban demolition project for the purpose of road-making in the world. If built, over 250,000 persons will be displaced and many thousand businesses destroyed. The area earmarked for demolition includes some of the poorest as well as oldest neighborhoods in the heart of Karachi. City experts say that not only is the expressway unnecessary, the consequences of building it would be disastrous for the city. However, the government is determined to go ahead with the project, and has already begun demolition work. So far over 500 homes have been destroyed with the affected left to sit on rubble. This documentary is a record of atrocities, and of the people's anger towards the upcoming 'Lyari Expressway.'
