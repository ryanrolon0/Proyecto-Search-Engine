The Saints of Mt. Christopher

 As a capacity crowd holds their breath, sophomore sensation DELROY LINKS falls dead during the biggest game of his career. Simultaneously, Delroy's death effectively ends the career of brand-named college basketball coaching legend, PHIL NEVERS. Rumors allege Nevers chose to withhold reports of Links condition in an effort to secure the conference championship. Two years later, and after a five-year hiatus from competitive athletics, MT. CHRISTOPHER UNIVERSITY reinstates their athletic program. And like most universities looking to jumpstart a newly awakened sports program, they need an influential personality to not only secure a winning team, but to validate the existence of that program. In the case of Mt. Christopher, among the names mentioned as possible head basketball coach is former University of South Alabama head coach, Phil Nevers. Meanwhile, the severe racial restraints of the south challenges a budding friendship between, DREESE WILLIAMS, a humble yet driven young African American basketball player, from the obscure little town of Pelican, Louisiana. And a troubled white teen named MATTHEW SATLER, who is sent to Louisiana to live with his father, after he proves too much to handle for his mother in Montana. These two kids are unwillingly thrown into an unfortunate way of life, and find themselves battling the only thing they can truly count on, each other. As the Saints of Mt. Christopher approach their first season in five years, the journeys of three individuals will end at one destination.....
