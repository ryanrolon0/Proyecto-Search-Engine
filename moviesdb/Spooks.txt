Spooks

 Another entry in Educational's series featuring the singing and dancing of The Cabin Kids, a "down South" version of the Meglin Kiddies, but the kids are all black and most likely from New York and not the South. The Black-stereotypes of the era that Hollywood hung on most adult Black performers were also hung on the Cabin Kids. The Kids do a couple of songs and roll their eyes and get scared in this one, which IS a Sound film and not Silent as shown by some sources. Singing was not an attribute that popped up too often in "silent" movies.
