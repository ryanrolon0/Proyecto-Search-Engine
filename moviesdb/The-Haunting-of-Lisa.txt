The Haunting of Lisa

 A young and innocent girl named Lisa receives mysterious visions about the murder of a young child. When the visions become increasingly more intense, Lisa's parents ask for the help of a priest to figure out what is going on. Are Lisa's visions real? What are they trying to say? Soon, these visions set in motion a search for the killer who may also be responsible for other deaths and who may need to kill Lisa to avoid being caught.
