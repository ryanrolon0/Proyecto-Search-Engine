Waves

 A fine line separates reality from dreams. A girl is obsessed about who she thinks is her soul mate. Her craving and desire make her a slave of her own passion. She will be rejected by her loved one. Her desperation makes her go crazy. One day soon will be her last day. She jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge. The WAVES will bring her back. Still in her own nightmare, she won't let go on her obsession
