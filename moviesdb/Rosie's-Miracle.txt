Rosie's Miracle

 The Connelly family is like any typical working family living near the big city. They aren't wealthy by any means, but they get by. When the young Connelly son Joe becomes stricken with a terminal illness, the limits of the family's faith in God, modern medicine, and the kindness of strangers is pushed to the limit. Ultimately, it is up to the youngest member of the Connelly family, six-year-old Rosie, to seek out the miracle they so desperately need. Will she succeed? Can the Connelly family survive on faith and love?
