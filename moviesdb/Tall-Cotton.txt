Tall Cotton

 Glot, a ravenous space diva with bad gums from the 4th Galaxy dines nightly on unlucky townsfolk who will gladly sacrifice each other (or even turn into grave robbers!) to avoid becoming the alien's next meal. Newcomer Lilly hitchhikes into town looking for love and falls for Glot's henchman Pinch, and further inflames his thuggish passions with dance and song at Muley Boo's cabaret. Just what is Tall Cotton's shame? And will the wily stooge Vermin escape the gums of Glot to tell?
