Time's Up!

 An Argentinian psychiatrist, who fled her country under the most dire circumstances to assume a new life in New York City, struggles in a search for her identity while carrying the burden of her past and that of her strong dedication to her new patients. Psychoanalyst sees her patients in a mobile home ("Therapy To Go!", carrying her motley group of patients through New York City's streets); however, the therapist seems to suffer from an emotional crisis of her own, and something from her past deeply troubles her. Could she be someone other than she claims she is?
