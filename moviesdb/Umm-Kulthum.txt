Umm Kulthum

 A special-interest documentary about Egypt's (and the Arab world's) legendary superstar, a singer-performer in a category all her own Kulthum, perhaps the greatest singer who ever lived. Omar Sharif narrates while we are shown bits of her life story, interviews, live performances, and the Egyptian public's reaction to this legend, coming from all levels of Egyptian society.
