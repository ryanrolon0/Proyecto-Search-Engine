Strip School

 Seeing a gap in the market an ex-stripper opens the London School of Striptease, the first in the UK, to teach young women the art of striptease as this line of work has recently become acceptable and lucrative especially in the capital. The programme follows four such women who attend the course from the start until their first strip in front of a live audience.
