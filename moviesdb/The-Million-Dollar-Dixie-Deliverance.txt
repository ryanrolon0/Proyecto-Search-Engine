The Million Dollar Dixie Deliverance

 During the Civil War, five children from a Union family are held hostage by Confederate soldiers. A wounded Union soldier (who happens to be black) takes refuge in the barn of the place the children are being held. They discover him and secretly nurse him back to health while they plan a daring escape.
