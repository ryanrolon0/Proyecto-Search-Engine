The Mad Room

 Remake of 1941's "Ladies in Retirement" has psychotic Stella Stevens playing companion to wealthy, loony widow and she soon brings her brother and sister to live with them after they are released from an asylum for brutally murdering their parents years before. Now there appear to be skeletons that Stevens has worked so hard to keep hidden, ready to tumble out of her closet.
