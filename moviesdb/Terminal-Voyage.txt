Terminal Voyage

 It is 2035 A.D. and the fimal countdown has begun for a voyage that will reach across the vastness of outer space -- to explore the nearest Earth-Like planet. An international crew has been placed in cryogenic suspended animation for the journey. But a century later, they awake to find that things have gone horribly wrong. A scientific mission goes haywire. After the mysterious death of the captain the misery continues as the successive captains die under equally mysterious circumstances. Meanwhile the earth is completely decimated and the rest of the crew go into depressive spells.
