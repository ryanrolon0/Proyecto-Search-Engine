Slaughtered Secretaries

 Set in the 1950's, three secretaries fall victim to Artie, a deranged janitor who attacks all three of them, leaving one of them alive! He then takes them into another room where he plays strip poker and Russian Roulette with them. The secretaries are dressed in the fashions of the 50's including garter belts and 50's hairdos.
