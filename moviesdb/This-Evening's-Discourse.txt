This Evening's Discourse

 Nicholas Fuller, a top ranking executive and infamous "spin-doctor" for the world's leading Hydrocarbon supplier, "Global Petroleum", has stopped at nothing to attain his dreams of wealth and power. Although, not inherently an evil man, Nick is the face for the many hidden atrocities his organization has created. Having endured the loss of his wife and child, Nick has always chosen his work over anything of real substance in his life. Alone and with nothing to be afraid of anymore, nothing to keep him grounded, Fuller has no equal. We join Fuller after a press conference. He had received a bombardment of questions pertaining to the unethical and illegal actions of his corporation's dealings overseas. Nick does what he does best, talks his way out of the situation with excellence and precision. Later that night... As Fuller reminisces about his forever-lost family, we see that he had never truly appreciated them. Their love was never enough. Fuller begins to drink himself into submission to hide his pain. A mysterious voice beckons him. Something has joined Nick. An apparition? A friend? A presence... Fuller knows the voice...It has been a long time coming. The Devil has joined Nick for an evening discourse about his actions. Through the inner workings of their conversation, they touch upon issues of morality, religion, and justice. As this conversation ensues, we realize that the Devil is not there judging Nick attempting to make him change. If it were up to the Devil, Nick would continue his ways. The Devil is there to praise Nick for all the "good" he is doing for the world. Will Nicholas Fuller realize the path he has chosen as a man? Only he can decide his destiny.
