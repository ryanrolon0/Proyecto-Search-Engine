The Proxy Hypothesis

 The objective of The Proxy Hypothesis was to create a video from the results of hour long isolated improvisations to camera by five individual performers whose usual practice is live performance in front of an audience. The editing process aimed to evidence a specific non-performance situation within each performer's action in order to investigate the performers' relationship with themselves, their understanding of performance and with the technology of the video camera.
