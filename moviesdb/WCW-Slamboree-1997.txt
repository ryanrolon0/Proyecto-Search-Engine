WCW Slamboree 1997

 Tradition battles the New World Order at Slamboree 1997. "The Nature Boy" Ric Flair returns to the ring in his home town of Charlotte, NC. Flair has been out of action for nine months, but finally he has returned to World Championship Wrestling to aid in the battle against the nWo. Flair will not be alone, as he will team with fellow legend, "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and Carolina Panthers own Kevin Greene. The trio will battle the nWo's anti-tradition unit of Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Syxx. Kevin Greene isn't the only NFL star stepping off of the grid iron and stepping into the ring at Slamboree. Green Bay's own Reggie White will also step into the ring against his long time NFL rival, Steve "Mongo" McMichael. Will the nWo reign once again or will tradition live on at Slamboree?
