The Snail Film

 E Ora al Cinico Languido (Now Unto the Languid Cynic) tells of the ill-fated misadventure that follows a cantankerous old Snail's decision to walk out on his quarrelsome and narcissistic wife. He quickly discovers that life outside the confining walls of their desert abode is not so friendly as it seemed to have been in his romanticized youth.
