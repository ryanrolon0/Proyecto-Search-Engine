Veritales

 Veritales is a trilogy of linked short films, all quirky, playful, nearly silent modern adaptations of three classic fairy tales Sleeping Beauty, and Red Riding Hood. The script was inspired by the earliest versions of all three stories. Set in the forest of dreams, the film is comic, sexy, scary, romantic and endearing. Veritales mixes influences from classic horror films, silent films, the Keystone Cops and more, adding contemporary twists to the tales' original endings.
