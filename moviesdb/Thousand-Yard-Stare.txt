Thousand Yard Stare

 A man searches for a job to settle a debt with a bookie. He runs across a temp agency that specializes in exotic and creepy job offerings. He runs across 3 very unusual employers with 3 unusual jobs. He goes on a job interview with them all. A roof top bird poo window washer who is unusually passionate about his job, an insane bellhop that wrestles the interviewed man to make sure he is tough enough to run his elevator, and a desk job clerk with offices located in the dungeon of an old torture chamber. Eventually he gets rid of the temp agency and finds a happy home at a safe and secure job at a bank.
