The Gentle Trap

 On his first burglary, a locksmith finds himself on the run after his accomplice is run down by another band of thugs after the haul. Realising that his girlfriend has double-crossed him for a seedy nightclub owner, the lad ends up with the loot in a flat above a clip joint hiding out from both police and crooks. But the girls living there seem about as trustworthy as his own bird turned out to be.
