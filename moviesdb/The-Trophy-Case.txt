The Trophy Case

 The backdrop of The Trophy Case Italy. Chosen because Florence is a Renaissance city famous for its art and architecture. There is history and culture in every corner and we travel full circle to where the poem originates. Our antagonist is on a quest to find a series of prehistoric stone structures which may have been built for observatory purposes, reminiscent of Stonehenge but taller and possibly earlier. These stone structures were located over three thousand feet above sea level on an Italian mountainside. Paradiso, represented in sun, moon, stars and planets, is divided up into nine spheres. Spheres one and two are represented by the Inconstant and the Ambitious. Sphere three holds the Lovers. Spheres four and five are the Wise and the Warriors. Sphere six is represented by the Just Rulers. Spheres seven and eight hold the Contemplatives and The Fixed Stars. Sphere nine represents the Angels. Each sphere that our antagonist passes through brings him one step closer to salvation. Our protagonist continues, hot on the heels of this sadistic taxidermist, who uses the body parts of his seven victims to recreate his own guide out of hell and mental torment... the patchwork angel, Beatrice.
