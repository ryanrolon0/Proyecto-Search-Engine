Strike

 1357. Somewhere in Europe. These are troubled times. Wars nearly destroyed all crops. To avoid starvation, monks are sharing out bags of flour. With this help, survival becomes possible. A lonesome countryman on his way home with his flour encounters a threatening knight in a rusted armor who will harass him to death... A peaceful countryman on his way home with food for his family crosses path with a threatening knight in a rusted armor. That knight's main pleasure is to target lonesome men in the forest and harass them until they lose their soul and humanity. Until they finally become worthy of killing. His new target is our countryman. He will block his way. He will steal from him. He will burn him. He will choke him. He will give him hope and then destroy it. He will play with his mind and hurt his body. He will make him run and hide. He will make him crumble and fall. He will strike him and crush him. Every way he can. He will have his prey. 1357 -- Somewhere in Europe -- A peaceful and candid countryman on his way home with food for his family crosses the land of a threatening knight in a rusted armor -- That knight's pleasure is to target lone men and harass them until they lose their humanity and then become worthy of killing -- His new target is our countryman -- He will block his way -- He will steal from him -- He will burn him -- He will choke him -- He will give him hope and then destroy it -- He will play with his mind and hurt his body -- He will make him run and hide -- He will force him to crumble and fall -- He will beat him and strike him without mercy -- Every way he can -- He will have his prey.
