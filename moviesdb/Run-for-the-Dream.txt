Run for the Dream

 Truth IS stranger than fiction. Olympic gold medal hurdler Gail Devers almost lost her feet to a mysterious disease after being picked for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. She failed to qualify for the finals as the disease (Graves Disease) left her feet swollen, cracked and oozing blood. After 2 years doctors were on the verge of amputating when it was discovered that radiation treatment was making it worse. Gail Devers eventually recovered and went on to win the 100m in Barcelona and may have won the 100m hurdles if she hadn't tripped on the final hurdle. She also competed in and won the sprint at Atlanta.
