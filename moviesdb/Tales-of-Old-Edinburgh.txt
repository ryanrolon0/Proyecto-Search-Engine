Tales of Old Edinburgh

 The distinctive character of Edinburgh's most historic thoroughfare is vividly brought to life on this exciting and unusual video. Our guide through the closes and wynds of the mile is Adam Lyal (deceased), hanged in the Grassmarket in 1811. Adam is now the city's most famous and charismatic ghost. He introduces us to the grandeur of the Royal Mile architecture, regales us with tales of execution, witchcraft, plague and torture. We meet intriguing characters from Edinburgh's colourful and eventful past-from John Knox to the Foule Clenger. Adam also visits the famous tattoo at the castle and soaks up the carnival atmosphere of the Edinburgh Festival.
