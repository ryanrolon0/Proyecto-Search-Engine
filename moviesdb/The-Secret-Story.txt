The Secret Story

 A puppeteer tells the fictionalized story of her mother's childhood. With a soundtrack of rain, images are layered one on another to provide a wordless narration. Birth in 1925, a puppy, education at the hands of nuns, learning to sew, the outbreak of world war, sexual awakening, the death of a parent these are key events in a life.
