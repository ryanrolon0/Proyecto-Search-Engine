The April Conspiracy

 In the spring of 1775, tensions between Great Britain and her American colonies escalated. King George III believed Americans wanted to overthrow the government. American Patriots thought the King had usurped their rights as British citizens. 'The April Conspiracy', an Electronic Field Trip to Colonial Williamsburg, has students march with British troops in April 1775 as they seize colonial weapons and powder in Virginia and Massachusetts. Students also join the Patriots in the confrontations at Lexington, Concord, and Williamsburg that launched a revolution.
