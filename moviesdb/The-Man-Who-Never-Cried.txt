The Man Who Never Cried

 Rafe Winston has never cried; not when he was a baby, not when his heart was crushed by his high school sweetheart, not even when he first saw Stephen Spielberg's E.T. So when his father dies, Rafe - age 32 - decides to embark upon a true emotional journey with hopes to shed his first tear before the funeral - and before it's not too late. Similar to films like Big Fish and Amelie, The Man Who Never Cried is a modern day fable that plumbs the depth of human emotion by showcasing equal amounts of hilarity and heart break. It'll make you laugh, think - it might even make you cry.
