Stephan@NadelÖhr.Zürich

 Zurich at the beginning of the 90s in the 20th century focuses on the blot on Switzerland's clean image open drug scene at the Platzspitz, just behind the Swiss National Museum. Right under the eyes of passers-by - tourists, business people, women with children - hundreds of mainly young people were shooting up drugs into their bloody, festering veins and openly dealing drugs in front of the police. Stephan was one of them. He shot up everything - the more the better. To him heroin was like a mother, who hugged him and cocaine was like a father who gave him the courage. A substitute for something he had never experienced. Ten years later old Stephan, who now is an accountant, as a cheerful, charming and responsible young man. By chance she discovers old video footage which shows Stephan as a junkie in a deplorable state. The filmmaker decides to tell his story. For a whole year, she accompanies the ex-junkie with her camera. Stephan openly talks about drugs, highs and withdrawal as well as the difficulties of his life after drugs and his fear of normality. He still thinks that taking drugs is one of the most exciting experiences you can have - 'better than sex' - and promptly succumbs to his old habit camera becomes the witness of a temporary relapse and his subsequent remorse. Fortunately, this happens in Zurich, a city that has learned to deal with its addicts. The result is a sensitive, lively and, at times, funny portrait of a young man who managed to escape from hell. A film which, last but not least, has a preventive effect, as it simply tells the naked truth.
