Pupu no monogatari

 Fu and Suzu are two pretty anarchist girls, who take to the road. They are off to visit the tomb of a small pig named PUPU. On the way, they meet Suzu's ex-lover, a gay couple, and a golf player; always getting in trouble. But whenever trouble comes, 'TrunkMan' the hero appears to save them. All changes, though, when one of the girls falls in love with TrunkMan.
