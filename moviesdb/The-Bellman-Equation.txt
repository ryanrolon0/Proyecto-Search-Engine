The Bellman Equation

 What is the Bellman Equation? This film searches for the mathematician who helped invent the Atom Bomb and invented the field of dynamic programming while being persecuted by McCarthy. A 12 year odyssey by the grandson of Richard Bellman, to solve the many issues surrounding Richard Bellman's life and death. Bellman remained an enigmatic figure to all who knew him, and his stature as one of the great mathematicians in history brings his grandson to some interesting revelations. One of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century, Richard Bellman was a pioneer in the field of computer science. Bellman's work changed the perception of the application of mathematics within science. The term 'Bellman Equation' is a type of problem named after its discoverer, in which a problem that would otherwise be not possible to solve is broken into a solution based on the intuitive nature of the solver. Applied in control theory, economics, and medicine, it has become an important tool in using math to solve really difficult problems. A fiercely independent and controversial figure, Mr. Bellman published more than 40 books and 600 papers before his early death of a brain tumor. The inventor of the field of dynamic programming was persecuted by McCarthy, worked on the Manhattan project, and remained as much a mystery as the problems he conquered.
