Red Bone Guerillas

 When filmmaker Bonita Evans sets out to document acting legend Magenta Bergenstein, she stumbles upon the beginnings of the counterculture performance art group, the Red Bone Guerillas. What results is an inside look at the group's meteoric rise to prominence as they rage against the mainstream media machine. At first, their interactive, "interventionist" street theater shocks the unsuspecting public, but when they are embraced by anonymous fans and the media alike, will they be co-opted by the monster they once vowed to destroy? Bonita Evans is on hand to document the Red Bone Guerillas as they rocket to the height of social disobediance and to offer an inside look at the complex personalities and group dynamics that make or break a movement.
