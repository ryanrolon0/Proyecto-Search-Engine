Sophie's Joy

 In claustrophobic closeness we study actress Julia Lomas through the life of Sophie - a feminine introvert investigating a world laden with lust, mystery & repetition. Mimicking the style of cartoons, soap opera & fly on the wall documentary, Sophie's Joy is a comedy where the characters & the audience become lost in the all-encompassing production of DESIRE. Sophie's Joy follows a week in the life of factory worker, Sophie . Sophie lives with her husband in a run down suburban flat. Her daily routine consists of work, cooking and spying on the neighbours. Sophie suspects something strange is happening in the neighbourhood may have something to do with the woman who lives in the next-door apartment.
