Scoopet

 A film-team are shooting a documentary depicting two men buying sex off the Internet. We follow the men as they meet with two women. As the film proceeds the more uncomfortable the situation becomes and the film-team's ethical principals prove less important than getting a good Scoop. Scoopet (The Scoop) is the harsh story about two fellow colleges at a company who are buying sexual favors from young women. The women, whom are introduced on the Internet, do not have any relationship to one another and they have different motives for prostitution. A documentary team films and interviews the involved at one of the meetings. In the quest for the big scoop, the filming steps beyond the limits of the ethics of journalism, into the disaster.
