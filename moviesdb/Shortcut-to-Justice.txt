Shortcut to Justice

 The story of the courageous "Women for Justice" from the sprawling city Vadodara in the northwest of India, close to the Pakistan border. The "Women for Justice" fight against the violence, many women there are suffering from. Because police and justice hardly give any protection or aid, they founded a court themselves. Every week they gather under a tree, on a dusty place on the edge of the poor quarter Kalyan Nagar and dispense justice. With quick-wittedness and creativity they put beating husbands and quarrelsome mother-in-laws in their place. And - if necessary - they go in as a "heavy squad" to help a poor widow, who was thrown out of the house after the death of her husband, to regain her belongings.
