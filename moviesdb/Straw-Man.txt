Straw Man

 By all outward appearances Luke (Hugh Scott) is a productive member of society. Steady job. Pays his taxes. But behind the solid citizen facade, he is actually a successful dealer of illegal firearms. Having no criminal record, he pays cash and stockpiles 'clean' guns to re-sell on the streets of Los Angeles for a handsome profit. What customers do with his product has nothing to do with him sleeps soundly. Until Emily (Sadie Alexandru), the widow of a man killed with one of Luke's guns, blackmails him dead. She wants Luke to pull the trigger. And after years of profiting off the murder of others, Luke must now descend into the criminal underworld, risk his own life, and find out if he can look death in the eye.
