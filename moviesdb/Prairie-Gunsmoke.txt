Prairie Gunsmoke

 To win possession of the ranches he holds mortgages on, crooked banker Jim Kelton (Tristram Coffin) has his henchmen led by Spike Allen (Joe McGuinn) raid the ranches and stampede the cattle herds thereby ensuring the ranchers can't meet their notes. U. S. Marshal Wild Bill Hickok (Bill Elliott) arrives and is immediately distrusted by Tex Terrell (Tex Ritter) because of Hickok's policy of enforcing the letter of the law. But when Hickok rescues rancher Henry Wade (Hal Price) and his daughter Lucy (Virginia Carroll) from the Kelton gang, Tex joins with Hickok to use the law against Kelton.
