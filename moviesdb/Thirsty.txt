 Josh has inherited an Irish bar in New York from Roxy, his mother, who recently passed. He's in denial can't bring himself to deal with the bar's mail and bills, and he may be seeing things. A date with the woman who delivers the bar's mail ends abruptly when she cottons onto his state of mind. Can he dismiss his mother from her own establishment? And if he does, how will others react?
