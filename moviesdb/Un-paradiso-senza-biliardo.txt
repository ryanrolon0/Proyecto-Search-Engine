Un paradiso senza biliardo

 It's the 1950s and Giuseppe gets a letter from his friend Franco who is working in Sweden. He writes that Sweden is a wonderful country with high salaries, free health care and most important, the girls are beautiful. In short, it is a paradise and Giuseppe travels to Sweden to work. But, as he soon finds out, Franco was not completely frank with him. The taxes are high, the coffee is like dish-water, no wine at the restaurant and worst of all - no billiards!
