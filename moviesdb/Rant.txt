Rant

 Can an ant salvage his reputation? A rough-voiced sergeAnt orders the ant colony to return with food or don't come back. The tough-sounding fast-talking Ray enlists Lalo, a Mexican immigrAnt, to follow. They raid a picnic for bits of bologna; then Ray tries to lead them back to the hill, where his reputation is none too hot. He gets the pair into danger more than once - all from an ant's eye view. After a deluge, they're back at the hill without any food. Go home defeated? Try again? Maybe Lalo has an idea.
