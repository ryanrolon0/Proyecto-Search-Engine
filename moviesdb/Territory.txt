Territory

 Territory is an unconventional love story based on Lawrence Levine's critically acclaimed play. When an old roommate drops by unannounced, his desperate attempts to recreate the past unearth old emotions and stretch conventional relationships to their breaking points. Ben and Maya appear to have everything - they are young, attractive, and complacent. When they return to their Manhattan apartment from a party late one Saturday night, the couple settles into a perfectly routine evening of domestic self-indulgence. The status quo, however, comes to an abrupt halt when their estranged friend and one-time third wheel, James, arrives unexpectedly, cranking up the music, slam dancing to hardcore, exposing old wounds, and uncovering the seething rage beneath the couples' urbanely complacent facade. When the dust settles, a devastating portrait of lust, longing, and unrequited love emerges, as the characters confront the approach of middle age by taking stock of their adult lives and confronting the failure of their youthful ideals.
