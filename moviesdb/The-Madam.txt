The Madam

 A young man on a motorcycle passes a pretty young girl on the road whose car has broken down. He stops and offers her a ride home, and she accepts. It turns out that she lives in a brothel run by her mother, and they offer the young man a job--to have sex with all of the hookers who live in the house.
