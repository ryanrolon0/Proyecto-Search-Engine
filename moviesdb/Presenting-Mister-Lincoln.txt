Presenting Mister Lincoln

 Abraham Lincoln's face is arguably the most recognizable face in the world. Lance Mack realized his likeness to our 16th President 20 years ago and immediately understood it as being more than coincidence. This short documentary explores Lance's unique experience and connects it to the special place occupied by Lincoln in the American identity at the intersection of faith, family, and... felines.
