The White Raven

 The White Raven is a huge diamond that was used to ransom a young girl from a German concentration camp during the war. When the camp was liberated, the diamond disappeared and the camp commander was imprisoned, but not hung, as he knew the whereabouts of the White Raven. But now he is dying and will only talk to an American journalist by the name of Tully whose grandfather was a sadistic guard at the camp. With different groups looking for the Raven, Tully becomes the key as he must crack the riddle as to the location of the diamond before everyone, including Tully, is eliminated. A journalist gets pulled into an intrigue by his editor that involves a story that he received a Pulitzer for years before. It seems that the second largest diamond ever mined was used during World War II to buy a Jewish woman freedom from a prison camp. Only trouble is it disappeared after the war and now everyone is after it, including the Russians, former Nazis, gangsters, and the original owner. Somehow, the story that the journalist originally wrote about a camp survivor is believed to have leads to the diamond.
