The Barber of Bangalore

 The Barber of Bangalore explores the harmony and dissonance created when East and West collide. Using irony and humour, two classical forms meet, western classical music and eastern classical dance (the use of expression called Abhinaya in Bharata Natyam). The result is odd, confusing, funny, ridiculous though sometimes quit lovely and harmonious !
