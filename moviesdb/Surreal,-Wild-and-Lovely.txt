Surreal, Wild and Lovely

 An actor named Vittorio, who is a terrible actor, gets his big break in a studio film, when his Uncle Lucio has a little talk with the director. Vittorio get's the part of a boxer who refuses to train hard to make the film look good, and the director is driving crazy by his actor's ineptness!!!
