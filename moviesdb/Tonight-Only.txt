Tonight Only

 Sally-Sarah arrives at this strange place, a shadow of her yesterdays. After a car crash takes her life, she encounters provoking characters, personifications of her own psyche in its stages of dying. Her journey is to integrate these broken selves to release herself from the despair of Purgatory so as to embrace acceptance and then transcendence.
