The Turtle Hunter

 Lyrical black-and-white images from 1961, a mesmerizing sound track, and an understated narrative tell the story of Otis Terrell Overland, who made his living stalking the giant alligator snapping turtle in the swamps and bayous of Mississippi. This quiet film offers a glimpse into a lifestyle that has been lost to the passage of time.
