Slaughterhouse Phi

 A clueless sheriff tries to solve a year old missing person report in a local sorority. Kayla disappeared during the "Tri-Phi's" annual initiation and sorority head Brit is trying to put all that behind her. It's her senior year and she has a legacy to worry about and with rush season rapidly approaching she is learning that some lies refuse to stay buried.
