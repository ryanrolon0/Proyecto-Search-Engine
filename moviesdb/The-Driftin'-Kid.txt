The Driftin' Kid

 Jim Vernon ('Tom Keene (I)' (qv)), Arizona rancher, attempting to fulfill a contract to deliver wild horses to the Mexican government, learns that his first consignment of 200 horses has been stolen by a borderland gang of rustlers. The Mexican authorities send Tom Sterling ('Tom Keene (I)' (qv)) to investigate the theft. When he arrives in town he discovers that he is being mistaken for Jim Vernon. Since the two me look exactly alike, Jim goes into hiding while Tom impersonates him. Gang leader Ace Reed ('Earl Douglas (II)' (qv)), unaware of the switch, puts the stolen horses back onto Jim's ranch, hoping the latter will be strung up for a horse thief and he and his gang can take over Jim's ranch and Mexico contract.
