Under the Spreading Blacksmith Shop

 Andy Panda is helping his pop out in his blacksmith shop and expresses a desire of his to shoe a horse. Pop tells him he couldn't even shoe a fly (laughs!!!) and decides to prove it to him by taking him up on the offer... namely by disguising himself as a horse (named Charlie) to fool his son. Andy agrees to shoe "Charlie" but the plan goes awry when all manner of disaster befalls the disguised pop culminating in his swallowing several magnets. The magnets within him attract first a heavy anvil and then a pile of burning hot horseshoes! Eventually the disguise comes off and Andy promptly shoes the disguise (thinking it's still Charlie) and proudly tells Pop, "Told ya I could shoe a horse!" Pop, still fleeing the horseshoes, asks Andy, "Tell your mom I won't be home for dinner!"
