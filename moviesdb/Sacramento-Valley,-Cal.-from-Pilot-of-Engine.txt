Sacramento Valley, Cal. from Pilot of Engine

 This is a beautiful stretch of railroad scenery along the Sacramento River in Upper California. The Southern Pacific crosses the Sacramento River nine times in this valley, and we show the reason for it in this picture, in which we round curves, pass great bluffs, and skirt the Sacramento River at one of its most picturesque points.
