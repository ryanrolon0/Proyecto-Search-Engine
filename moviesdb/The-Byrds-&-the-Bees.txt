The Byrds & the Bees

 A reluctant George Byrd is forced by his spend-happy wife, Willa, to finally have "the talk" with his three boys. No problem, right? Every parent has to explain "the birds and the bees" some day, so how hard can it be? This hilarious showdown between George and his family illustrates that anytime a parent thinks even the most common child-rearing exercise will be easy - watch out.
