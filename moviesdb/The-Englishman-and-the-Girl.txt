The Englishman and the Girl

 A small-town drama group's rehearsal is interrupted when one of their members receives a letter telling him his English relative is arriving for a visit. The Englishman turns out to be a stuffy and humorless, and is the butt of several pranks. The drama group dresses as Indians and threatens him, but he turns the tables, pulls out a gun and chases them away.
