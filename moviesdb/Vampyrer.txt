Vampyrer

 Vera and Vanja, two vampire sisters, are forced to run for their lives, when Vera kills the leader of a biker-gang in a night club. While escaping from the bikers, Vanja gets more determined that she wants to leave the outcast vampire-lifestyle and adjust to the human world. She wants to live a normal life, even though it means the end of a life together with her sister. Vera won't accept a life in solitude and is willing to fight to make her sister stay.
