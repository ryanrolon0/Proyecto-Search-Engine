Sretno dijete

 Through Zagreb, Ljubljana, Vienna, Belgrade, Budapest, Paris, Utrecht and New York, the author is in pursuit of the heroes of his youth, trying to tell to his own self the story about the expansion of punk-rock and the fall of socialism. With plenty of music and shots from the times of the new wave, The Lucky Child is a little monument to the generation that was growing up with a strong belief that rock'n'roll is more important than life.
