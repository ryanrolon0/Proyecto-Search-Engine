The Voice of Hollywood No. 26

 Kenneth Harlan and the Sisters G give the audience a look at George Olsen's Supper Club, and together they view a musical presentation. Two unidentified actors, made up to look and act like Laurel and Hardy, serve as waiters. Arthur Lake, Robert Woolsey, Bert Wheeler and Monte Blue are briefly glimpsed (via archive footage), and George Olsen is seen having a conversation with one of his guests, Buster Keaton.
