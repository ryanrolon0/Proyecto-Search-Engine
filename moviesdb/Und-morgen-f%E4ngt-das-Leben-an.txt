Und morgen fängt das Leben an

 This emotionally intense Drama is about a group of high-school students, who just received their diploma. They plan to celebrate together with their girlfriends in a lonesome hut in the Eiffel forest. But the preconditions aren't good; only one of them received the desired college scholarship in USA and has to leave his younger girlfriend in Germany. Another one didn't make it into med school... so uncertainy about the future, envy and jealousy lead to melancholy and finally into a tragic escalation.
