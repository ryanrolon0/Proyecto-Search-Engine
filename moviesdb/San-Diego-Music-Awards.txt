San Diego Music Awards

 The San Diego Music Awards is an annual, locally televised award show that showcases the increasingly large talent pool of San Diego musicians. Its goal is not only to highlight the vast amount of local talent but, and more importantly, to raise much needed funding for elementary school music education programs.
