Scenes from the... Micro-War

 After Ronald Reagan decides to spend 42% of the budget on defense, a family of four (including an artificial son Katya really did think was her brother) act like they are constantly in a war zone--driving a camo car, wearing camo, always armed and prepared to shoot, even simulated targets. Millner narrates based on data and a Dear Abby story, and makes the final comment that then 2 1/2 year old Katya would say "video clothes" whenever she saw people wearing camouflage.
