Stolen Harmony

 Band leader Jack Conrad is impressed by prison inmate Ray Ferrera on saxophone. Conrad hires Ray to join his band and tour upon his release. Ray hooks up with Jean, a dancer in the show, and the two become a successful dance act. However, when an ex-inmate buddy of Ray's robs the tour bus, Ray is suspected of wrongdoing by Jack and the others in the group. After a gang of thugs hijacks the tour bus, Ray tries to use his street smarts to redeem his reputation. Ray Ferrera, star saxophonist in the prison orchestra, gets out and is hired by big bandleader Jack Conrad; the band leaves on a cross-country tour in Jack's luxurious, airplane-shaped bus. At first, all goes well for Ray (and lover). But old associations get Ray in trouble when the band is victimized by gangsters. Finale is a classic careening car chase.
