The Tree Officer

 The frustrations of work. In claymation, we meet Gary Dremmel, the town's tree officer. He's being interviewed on camera, perhaps by a local television reporter. He talks about his early love of trees and his frustrations at work, primarily because most of the calls are for him to cut something down. We meet Avril and Matt, his two staff members - an incompetent clerk and an assistant who knows nothing about trees and who methodically seeks to set a record for most staples stuck into a single sheet of paper. On the day in question, Gary faces a community rumor of Dutch elm disease.
