Slew Hampshire

 In April of 1994, one of the most brutal mass slaughters in history occurred in the woods of northern New England. Four months later, history is about to repeat itself. The end of summer signals the brink of manhood for a group of 18-year-old boys who pridefully call New Hampshire their home. Led by Buddy - once regarded as a major league pitching prospect - the boys embark on a local rite of passage, traveling north for one final weekend of debauchery in Canada. Unfortunately, it may just be their final weekend, period - as this rite goes very wrong. Along the way, the boys pick up Bro, their most intelligent - and only African American - friend, who is about to embark on an academic career at Dartmouth College. Where his right hand once resided is now a stump, and while this painful reminder of a terrible accident signifies a darker time, little does he realize what it will come to signify to those whom he encounters in the backwoods of New Hampshire. Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "Not till we are completely lost or turned 'round do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature." Unfortunately for the boys, just being lost would be a luxury compared to what they are about to experience - as there is nothing to be appreciated about what nature has in store for them on this night. What begins as a humorous comedy of errors quickly becomes a Darwinian gore fest, and what unfolds is a cerebral yet repulsive journey through the history and nature of humanity and "civilization." With four distinct clans vying for supremacy and survival in the woods of New Hampshire, less than 24 hours will pass before a slew of lives have been claimed and the last of the living remains.
