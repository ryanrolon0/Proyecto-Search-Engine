Taxi nach Kairo

 Eight years after we met him in Taxi Zum Klo, Frank is still up his same old tricks. In fact, the hustler he brought home last night tied him up and robbed him. His mom is pressuring him to marry and the girl he's been passing off to her as his girlfriend has a thing for the same guy he does..
