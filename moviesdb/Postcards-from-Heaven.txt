Postcards from Heaven

 A film by renowned photographer Phil Borges, 'Postcards from Heaven' is short, dramatic documentary about one surgeon's courageous battle to help victims of domestic violence heal and start life again after they were attacked, severely burned and disfigured. One of Sri Lankans few plastic surgeons, Dr. Chandini Perera, tackles the taboo subjects of acid burns and self-immolation; she transforms not only the lives of 15,000 patients but is changing societal prejudices against burns, disabilities and domestic abuse. Making only $600 a month and fighting an unpopular cause, she is motivated by her empowered women patients, her 'postcards from heaven.
