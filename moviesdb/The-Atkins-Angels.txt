The Atkins Angels

 An Atkins diet support group - Marge, a housewife, Isabella, an aspiring actress and the founder of Atkins Angels, and Sebastian, an ex-militant - await a visit from Anthony Atkins. He puts them through their paces, chanting the "no carbs" mantra. They do well until the ultimate test picnic table full of carbs that he orders them to touch, smell, rub on their faces, but not eat. Can they pass the test? And what of Sebastian's skeptical roommate, Pete? In between footage of Atkins' visit, there are interviews with the principals discussing their pasts, their love lives, and biblical history.
