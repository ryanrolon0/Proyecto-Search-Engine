Stimme des Blutes

 Two brothers (Albert Matterstock and Attila Hoerbiger), who are trapeze artists, are getting along just fine until Hoerbiger runs off with his brother's wife. Matterstock isn't very pleased when his wife is killed. But, the show must go on, and they resume their trapeze act as partners. Anneliese Uhlig joins the circus and a stunt artist and Matterstock falls in love with her. Otto Wernicke, Miss Uhlig's father,(who has forced her to do her dangerous act) is killed, and Herbiger confesses, in an act of atonement, as he thinks his brother or Miss Uhlig did it.
