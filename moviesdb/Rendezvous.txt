Rendezvous

 This real-time 3-D flight simulator puts you at the controls of an advanced Enterprise Class Space Shuttle. Your mission is to deliver needed supplies to a space station orbiting the Earth. Your mission has four phases. In Earth Lift-Off, once your shuttle clears the launchpad, you must carefully control the pitch of your spacecraft to gain the proper vertical and horizontal velocity to achieve orbit. In Orbital Rendezvous, with your shuttle now in orbit, you must determine the correct thrust angle to boost your spacecraft into the space station's orbit. In Approach, you are now in the space station's orbit, but it is out of visual range. You must adjust the shuttle's three directional velocities to bring the shuttle to withing visual range of the space station. In Alignment and Docking, once you are within visual range of the space station, you must carefully maneuver the shuttle into the docking port in a sequence reminiscent of the docking sequence in _2001
