The Paradigm

 Following a global war of untold devastation, one city emerged with the promise of safety, Paradigm. It did not take long for the affects of absolute power to take hold of Paradigm's leaders. Seeing the opportunity, they seized control of their inhabitants, masking everyone. But the spirit of humanity could not be silenced. A young military scientist, by the name of Jack Walla rd dared to oppose power, hoping to do more than just free his people. Like all journeys, the ends always sound easy before considering the means.
