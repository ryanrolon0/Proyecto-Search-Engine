On the other hand, there is 2% of the mortal population. Mortals are just like us. They become wrinkled as they get older. Tom, born to be a mortal, doesn't feel a true love from his immortal parents. He lives far away from his parents until he gets a cancer at 60. Tom decides to come back home to reconcile himself with his immortal parents before he dies. But his reconciliation isn't easy.
