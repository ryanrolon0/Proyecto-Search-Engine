The Rustler Sheriff

 The citizens of San Juan County are very much aroused by the repeated depredations of a gang of cattle rustlers. Posse after posse, led by the sheriff, followed the rustlers into the mountains, but the outlaws always managed to elude their pursuers. Charley Walton surprises the rustlers in the act of running off his stock and opens fire. One of the rustlers turns in his saddle and fires point blank at Walton, killing him instantly. Shortly after, Maud Walton, his daughter, accompanied by her lover, Jack Beemis, riding along the boundary, comes upon the ranchman's lifeless body. The distracted daughter kneels beside her dead father and her lover, deeply distressed by her grief, swears to track down the men who committed this crime and bring them to justice. The rustler who fired the fatal shot, rides to a secluded spot, and removing his false beard, and pinning on a star, transforms himself into the sheriff. When Jack arrives in town to notify the sheriff of this fresh depredation he finds him delivering a harangue to the boys about the rustlers, and insisting that if they will only follow him he will round the outlaws up. Jack leads the sheriff and the posse to the scene of the recent crime, and shows the sheriff the trail as indicated by the trampled grass and hoofmarks of the cattle. The sheriff disregards Jack's advice, claiming that it is a rustler's trick to disguise their real trail, and he leads the posse in the opposite direction, toward the timber land. Jack becomes suspicious of him, and when their search ends in failure, he determines to play a lone hand and locate the rustlers himself.
