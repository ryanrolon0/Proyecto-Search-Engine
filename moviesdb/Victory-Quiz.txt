Victory Quiz

 Narrator Pete Smith gives us 15 seconds to answer a series of multiple-choice questions that are interspersed with news footage of the U.S. Armed Forces in action a galvanized Guernsey; in what year was the tank invented; when was the parachute invented; when was the airplane conceived; when was the submarine conceived; who invented all four of these; what's a honey barge; why are Marines called leathernecks; and, what's the translation of "E Pluribus Unum"? There's humor in some of the choices, some of the answers, and some of the footage.
