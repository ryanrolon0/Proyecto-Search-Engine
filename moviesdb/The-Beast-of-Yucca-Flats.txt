The Beast of Yucca Flats

 A defecting Russian scientist is transformed by an atomic test into a hulking monster, Tor Johnson, of course. Not much else except some people are killed, boys get lost, and a rabbit sniffs Tor's corpse. (This film was used for Mystery Science Theater 3000.) Coffee-obsessed B-movie auteur Coleman Francis was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world with this standard "man becomes radioactive monster" movie rendered hilariously surreal entertainment by the soundtrack having been lost in production and replaced by nonsensical rambling narration from a drunk-sounding Francis.
