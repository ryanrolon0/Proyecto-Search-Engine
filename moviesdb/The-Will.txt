The Will

 Nothing's funnier than a dead body. 'The Will' follows Dylan Buchanan, a mechanic for the family auto shop, as his world spins out of control with the death of his father. When his father's will surfaces, however, the family business is willed to a gloating David Buchanan, and Dylan makes a haphazard decision that will change the course of his life permanently.
