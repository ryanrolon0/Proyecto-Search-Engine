Random Natural Occurrence

 "I died and went to... a day job?" Welcome to Purgatory's grueling Life Traffic Control, the after-life department responsible for maintaining the balance of life and death on Earth. Births are on the rise and life traffic controllers must keep a keen eye on all opportunities to pluck a soul from its mortal coil. Failure to take advantage of a fatality opportunity requires a Random Natural Occurrence, or RNO, to preserve the status quo. After one RNO too many, failure prone controller Wesley is threatened with damnation by his domineering boss and decides to take matters into his own hands proving that living isn't easy and dying isn't hard, but managing both can be murder!
