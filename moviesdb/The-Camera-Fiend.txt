The Camera Fiend

 This is the first of a series of comedy pictures showing the adventures of a camera fiend. One of his ambitions is to secure a picture of a drowning person. He chances on a dock at the very moment when a small boy falls overboard from a boat. The boy goes down three times and the camera fiend snaps him each time. Just then the frantic mother rushes down and learns of the occurrence. The father runs to the dock, plunges in and brings up the boy. The usual measures of resuscitation are at once put into operation and the camera fiend insists upon trying to take a picture of this. The father, exasperated beyond all reason, knocks the camera fiend into the water, where he flounders until a farmer comes along and pulls him out with a rake, more dead than alive. The farmer then loads the limp camera fiend into a wheelbarrow and carries him off.
