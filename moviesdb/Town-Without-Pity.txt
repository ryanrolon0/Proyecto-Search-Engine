Town Without Pity

 When four young American soldiers are accused of raping a girl from a German village near their camp, Major Steve Garrett is assigned the distasteful task of defending them. It soon becomes clear that the Army, the villagers, and even the girl's family are more interested in revenge than in the welfare of the distraught victim. Garrett is faced with the dilemma of destroying the girl on the witness stand in order to save the lives of his clients.
