The Catsitter

 Mama's boy bachelor Bob lives in a house in Toronto with his mother, the basement suite of which is rented to a slacker freeloader named David, who is already one month late in his rent. Bob's mother recently had an accident which resulted in her spraining her ankle. Bob is planning on a weekend away to visit his Internet girlfriend for the first time, she who lives in Timmins a ten hour drive away. Because of Bob's mother's immobility, Bob reluctantly takes David up on his offer to look after Bob's cat, Whiffles, while he is away in Timmins. While Bob nervously spends the weekend with his girlfriend, incidents happen back in Toronto which David relays back to Bob in David's unique manner.
