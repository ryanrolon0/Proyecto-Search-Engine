Walden

 Henry David Thoreau purchases a house in Los Angeles to get away from distractions and write his memoirs and reflections. Little does he know that his house is actually a portal to hell. Henry, his mailman, a psychotic security officer, two religious fanatics, a fallen priest and his neighbor must defeat the minions of hell and save the world.
