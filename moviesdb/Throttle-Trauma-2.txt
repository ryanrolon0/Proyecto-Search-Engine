Throttle Trauma 2

 The AsphaltJunkiez are back! This time around terrorizing the busy streets of Vancouver. Join us on this adventure as we travel down south to sunny Los Angeles and Sin City, where we catch up with Apex, Kande and many ofther riders. Find out what it really takes to survive the game. Just as Throttle Trauma broke stereotypes in the stunt community, Street Kings will split wigs in the bike industry and beyond.
