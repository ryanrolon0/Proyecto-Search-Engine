Virtual JFK

 VIRTUAL JFK investigates one of the most debated "what if" scenarios in the history of U.S. foreign policy done in Vietnam if he had not been assassinated in 1963, and had he been re-elected in 1964? The film employs what Harvard historian Niall Ferguson calls "virtual history," assessing the plausibility of counterfactuals - "what ifs" - and the outcomes they might have produced. The heart of the film deals with the question war and peace?
