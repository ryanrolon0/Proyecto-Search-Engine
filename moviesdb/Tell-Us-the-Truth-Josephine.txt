Tell Us the Truth Josephine

 Tell Us the Truth Josephine is an experimental Drama about a Maltese woman's search for 'Home'. Josephine walks across Canada on stilts. And for Josephine to find home she must accept the 'Truth'. And once she does she can come off her stilts and land. Her journey is haunted by fragmented voices and images of her bloodline - bitter immigrant stories.
