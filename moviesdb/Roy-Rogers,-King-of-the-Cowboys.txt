Roy Rogers, King of the Cowboys

 Thys Ockersen enjoyed in his childhood in the fifties with his friends the Roy Rogers pictures in the local cinema. Many years later he starts his search for the old singing cowboy and his wife Dale Evans. A journey that starts in Amsterdam with a meeting with Roy's granddaughter Mindy who lives there. On his travels he meets co-stars of Roy and Dale and their director William Witney. And than there's the Roy Rogers Museum in Victorville where Thys talks with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and sees the stuffed Trigger.
