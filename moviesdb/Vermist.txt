Vermist

 Five members of the Missing Persons Task Force investigate the mysterious disappearance of 17-year-old Evi. While unraveling the girl's troubled relationship with her parents, which leaves her father as one of the prime suspects, they discover that her life had recently taken a bizarre turn, with the teenager seen at several sex parties, receiving expensive gifts from a shadowy new friend. Was Evi the victim of a pimp, or did her father discover his daughter's double life and lose control?
