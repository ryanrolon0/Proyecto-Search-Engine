Spirit Trap

 In London, four students have a call from the student accommodation office of the local university offering lodging in an old house. The psychic Jenny, the graph design student Nick, and the couple of lovers and drug dealers Tom and Adele are welcomed by the weird Tina. Nick fixes a spirit clock, and sooner Jenny sees the crimes that happened in the house in the past, when two lovers died. Along the two next days, Jenny, Nick, Tom and Adele disclose that each one of them had killed a person on the past and also that they are trapped in the house, since a ghost is claiming a killer for a killer to release the soul of Edmund Joseph.
