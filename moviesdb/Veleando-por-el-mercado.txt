Veleando por el mercado

 Shot close up, the tarpaulins protecting the open markets in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico are like abstract paintings Their rich colors overlap and change with the breeze, and with the light. The sounds of their flapping in the wind mixes with the lively chatter and clatter of the market, set against the evocative tango music of Gil & Cartas.
