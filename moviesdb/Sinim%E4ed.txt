Sinimäed

 It is 1944. The Red Army that moves nearly a thousand kilometres towards the west elsewhere in Europe cannot conquer three heights of land near the eastern border of Estonia - the Blue Hills. Concentrating on the destiny of Paul Maitla, a hero of these defence battles, the film tells a story of the young men who had to make their choice at this complicated time in between two totalitarian powers. This Second World War documentary tells the story of the conscription of Estonian volunteers by the German Army for the Eastern Front. As the German Army retreated westwards in 1944, the Estonian volunteers returned to defend their homeland from the advancing Soviet Red Army who were not seen as liberators but instead brought back memories of the oppressive 1940 Stalinist occupation that had resulted from the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact. A war diary written by Estonian Captain Paul Maitla is used as the primary source material. There are also present day interviews with soldiers who took part in the war including Estonians, Germans and Russians as well as present day reminiscences by Paul Maitla's daughter. The last stand of the Estonian Army in the region known as the Blue Hills (Sinimäed in Estonian) in Estonia, allowed 80,000 Estonian refugees sufficient time to escape to the West and to avoid the resulting Soviet occupation. This documentary tells the story of the intense summer of 1944, one of the greatest defense battles of the Second World War. War historians analyze the reasons why Germans mobilized masses of Estonian volunteers, many in their teens, to the Eastern Front. Captain Paul Maitla wrote a diary throughout that summer, an emotional view inside the surrounding cruel war, where he was responsible for his company. This diary along with numerous interviews with the men who took part in the battles - Estonians, Germans, Russians - tells an interesting and little known story about the Second World War.
