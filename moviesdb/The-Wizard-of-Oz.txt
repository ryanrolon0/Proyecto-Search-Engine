The Wizard of Oz

 This whaked out anime short pulls out all the stops, making fun of every aspect of the story and filmmaking in general. Britain Dunham speaks like Arnold Schwarzenegger as "The Tinmanator" in this adaptation of the L. Frank Baum classic of the girl carried to a fantastic realm who must seek out the Wizard to get home. The Wizard here speaks just like Elmer Fudd.
