True Love Hotel

 The story of a small, lonely, anonymous resident of a large, alienating city. He has lived all his life in his parents house and continues to do so after their deaths (his father was killed in a war, and the mother faded to her death in the following years). The story is in three parts, and tells of the experiences of this one fellow throughout one day.
