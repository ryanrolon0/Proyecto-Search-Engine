 Karen Simpson and her daughter Sailor embark on their first vacation alone together since the untimely death of the girl's father. Sailor has ceased to speak since the death of her dad, and through a somewhat clairvoyant encounter with an elderly woman who has a message for the girl, Sailor finds an unlikely way for she and her mother to begin to recover.
