Thunderlust

 In a world that rocks, image makes the difference! Salacious Hair Metal Band Thunderlust arrive in Jordan to make the music video for their latest album - The Middle Beast. The band members must soon decide whether to let their Jordanian director take them in a new radical visual direction. The band enters a new level of crisis though and begins to break up. The remaining members realize that it may be time for reflection and change. Or maybe just just something that brings them more groupies.
