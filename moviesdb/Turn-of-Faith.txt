Turn of Faith

 The story of three friends who grew up in the same tough neighborhood and chose three very different paths. Joey became a cop, Frank became a priest, and Bobby went into the family business. No matter what happened, their loyalty was always to each other... until their friendship was given the ultimate test. Philly Russo, a father figure to the three friends, turns out not to be the man they once thought he was.
