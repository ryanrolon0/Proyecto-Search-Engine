Thomas Comma

 Thomas Comma, is the adventure of a lonely comma looking for the right sentence. The tale of the trials and tribulations of a comma on a quest, will not only delight and inspire children of all ages (and adults) - but will also encourage and educate them to have the best thing in them win. 'We;re all of us like commas,' said Martha Baird, 'looking for the right sentence.'
