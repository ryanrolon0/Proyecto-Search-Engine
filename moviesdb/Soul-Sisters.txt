Soul Sisters

 In SOUL SISTERS... ...An African medical student seeking better professional opportunity in the United States finds herself caught up in the American immigration war. With the political heat mounting on "illegal immigrants," she's faced only with a dilemma on the fringes of the society, where there's no hope for her career goal, or give up all hope on the American dream. ...A young African-American puts her life on hold to restore the glory of her parents' estranged marriage. After years of painful sacrifice, and amid the storm of her adolescent crises, she has to make a last shot for their reconciliation, or give up forever on her parents as she goes away to college. What happens when the lives of these two young women cross? The result is a soul-touching friendship that tests the limits of political laws and redefines human dedication.
