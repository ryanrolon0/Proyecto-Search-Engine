The Conservatory

 The Conservatory follows four high school seniors (and one pushy mother) as they battle each other and two hundred other hopefuls for a few coveted spots at the ultra-competitive Delaware Musical Theatre Conservatory. Henry and Jenna Barker, fraternal twins from upstate New York, share a genuine love for performing that has bonded them together since birth. In spite of their father's disapproval and the family's grim financial circumstances, the two siblings are determined to leave their small town behind and pursue a bigger life on the stage. Sandy Lynn Brown, a sweet girl from Texas, has been force-fed plies and soprano songbooks by her overbearing mother, Noreen, since the tender age of three. But as the audition nears and tensions flair, Sandy Lynn questions whether she can leave behind the life she loves for a dream more her mother's than her own. And finally there is Brandon Schaubman, an arrogant former child actor, who was blacklisted from Broadway at the age of 12 after accidentally setting another performer on fire. Determined to regain his former "glory," he risks his young future on an original song he's written just for the conservatory audition. A spirited satire of a world governed by song and dance, who will be accepted? Who will be rejected? Everyone's future hangs in the balance!
