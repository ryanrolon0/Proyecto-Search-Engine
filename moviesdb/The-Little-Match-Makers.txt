The Little Match Makers

 It's summer in San Diego. Lily (Hannah Frantz) and her mother, Diane (Jacleen Haber), are on vacation from New York City while Pepin (Julian Ortiz) and his father, Jose (Agustin Castaneda), from Mexico City are also on vacation. The kids meet at the beach and quickly discover they have a lot in common with each other even if they are from different places. Both are ten years old, both their parents are divorced, and both want their parents to be happy. Why not introduce their parents to each other in hopes that they will fall in love so everyone has the best summer ever? Despite Pepin & Lily's grand plan, it's not as easy as they think it will be. When they orchestrate the first encounter between their parents, much to their dismay, their parents can't stand each other! With a bad start, how can these little matchmakers spark the magic that will make their mom & dad fall for each other? The quirky Officer Candy (Richard Hatch) & the bumbling waiter (Valente Rodriguez) offer assistance, but will it help their cause or hinder it? Two kids with a shared goal-can they really succeed at 'matchmaking'?
