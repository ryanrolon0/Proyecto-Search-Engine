The Wizard of Manchester

 The Wizard of Manchester is a short documentary about Albert Levis, the owner of the Wilburton Inn and Museum of Creative Process in Manchester, VT. Albert's true calling, though, is to assimilate his theory, the universal equation for human behavior, into society. Though a series of peculiar sculptures and paintings strewn throughout the Inn's compound, Albert weaves his grand theory. Unsuccessful attempts to capture the attention of political leaders and the academic community have left Albert desperate. Will the world discover who he is and what he has to say before the aging Albert dies?
