Protesting the Dixie Chicks

 On May 1st, 2003, with much of the normally sedate country music community outraged by Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines' critical dig at the President, filmmaker Christopher Fleeger began an odyssey across the country, interviewing protesters at concerts and radio stations. What emerged is a fascinating look at a distinctly American discourse on discourse itself. This film focuses on the people who were inspired to add their voices and views to this storm of controversy and captures a crucial moment when many Americans sought to battle dissenting voices, believing it was the highest form of patriotism.
