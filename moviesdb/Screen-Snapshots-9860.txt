Screen Snapshots 9860

 Ralph Staub and the Screen Snapshots camera is on hand when the Hollywood Friars Club honors George Jessel. The toastmaster is Jack Benny, and the likes of Bob Hope, Eddie Cantor, Joe E. Lewis and Dick Powell take their turns on toasting/roasting Mr. Jessel. The short only shows the clean part of what each had to say about George Jessel, and that didn't take very long. Considering the amount of 16mm 'home-movies' footage Jessel supplied the Screen Snapshots series over many years, Columbia Pictures should have paid for the event.
