The Mysterious Desperado

 Learning Chito's wealthy uncle died without a will, Tim and Chito head for California. Arriving they quickly learn someone is out to kill Chito, and the other heir, Chito's cousin Ramon, is wanted for a murder he did not commit. Stevens is the culprit. As executor he is selling parts of the estate and needs the heirs out of the way. Tim Holt ('Tim Holt (I)' (qv)) and his sidekick, Chito Rafferty ('Richard Martin (II)' (qv)), arrive in Santo Domingo, California, to investigate Chito's claim to the estate of his late uncle, Don Bustamante, and quickly run into trouble. Elias P. Stevens ('Frank Wilcox' (qv)), the administrator, his clerk Whittaker ('Robert Williams (I)' (qv)), and Bart Barton ('William Tannen (I)' (qv)) are illegally selling the Bustamante property. Stevens had murdered Don Bustamante and framed his son Ramon ('Edward Norris' (qv)), and the latter is being hunted by the law authorities. The next day, Tim and Chito are ambushed and Chito is shot in the arm. With the aid of Ramon's sweetheart, Luisa('Movita' (qv)), they begin the task of exposing the culprits and clearing Ramon's name.
