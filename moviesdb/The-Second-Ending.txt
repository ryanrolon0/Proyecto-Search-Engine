The Second Ending

 Follows David, a young man, as he travels through a deserted train yard. It is just like a regular afternoon stroll, but finds himself obsessing over a dream about the end of the world. Before he begins to describe the dream he comes across a young boy wearing a top hat and a strange jacket who David learns is alive. But as David continues on his walk, leaving the boy, he finds himself to have a follower. The film plays on the mis-communication between the boy and David. It plays twice. Where the first showing features the subjective perspective of David, and the second time through reveals the omniscient reality of the narrative. The end result gives an impact with a message for humanity.
