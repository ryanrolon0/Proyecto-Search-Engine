The Red Ace Cola Project

 It's 1955 and artificial flavors, TV dinners and space-age foods are all the rage. The International Foods and Flavors Company hires its first woman flavorist, Dr. Elizabeth McCovovich. Elizabeth's dream is to work in the lab with her idol, resident big man flavorist Dr. John Comden, but she soon discovers that Dr. Comden sees her as a secretary, not a scientist. Determined to prove herself as a flavorist, Elizabeth must beat out her boss and everyone else to create a new formula for Red Ace Cola, the "cola of the future."
