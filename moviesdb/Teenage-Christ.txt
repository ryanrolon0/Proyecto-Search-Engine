Teenage Christ

 This story chronicles Jesus Christ in a modern-day high school. In addition to the typical adolescent problems of girls, puberty, school, and family, he has to manage newfound abilities that might not be normal, and face the truth about his biological father. Weaving together drama, comedy, and a Biblical background, audiences may discover that Jesus' coming of age is not unlike their own.
