Roping a Bride

 Tom and Dick are good friends, but they are both in love with the same young woman, Vera. Vera herself cannot decide which of the two suitors she prefers. Realizing that Vera cannot make up her mind, the two young men turn to their friend Bill Bush for help. After thinking it over, Bill suggests an unusual contest to see which one gets to ask Vera to marry him.
