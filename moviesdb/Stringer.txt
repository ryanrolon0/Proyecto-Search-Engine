Stringer

 Frank Simmonetti is working as a "stringer", a photo journalist taking all the pictures he wants to. His assistants can't work with him for a long time, except the ex-cop Jack who lives in a poor suburb of L.A. Together they roam the streets for the 6-o'clock-news and find the story of their lives
