The Ghost Writer

 An unremarkable ghost-writer has landed a lucrative contract to redact the memoirs of Adam Lang, the former UK Prime Minister. After dominating British politics for years, Lang has retired with his wife to the USA. He lives on an island, in luxurious, isolated premises complete with a security detail and a secretarial staff. Soon, Adam Lang gets embroiled in a major scandal with international ramifications that reveals how far he was ready to go in order to nurture UK's "special relationship" with the USA. But before this controversy has started, before even he has closed the deal with the publisher, the ghost-writer gets unmistakable signs that the turgid draft he is tasked to put into shape inexplicably constitutes highly sensitive material. In London, the agent Rick Ricardelli invites his friend to apply to the Rhinehart, Inc. as ghostwriter of the former unpopular British Prime Minister Adam Lang. He is hired to complete and revise Adam's memoir since his predecessor Mike McAra had an accident or committed suicide and was found drowned on the coast. The ghostwriter travels to the Island Town of Old Haven where Adam presently lives with his wife Ruth and sooner the writer feels the tension between Ruth and Adam's secretary and mistress Amelia Bly. When Adam Lang is involved in a human rights scandal, the ghostwriter accidentally discovers that Mike had some hidden pictures and a telephone number in his room. The ghostwriter decides to investigate and learns that Adam's political career might have been built by the CIA to support the controversial decisions of the American government. Further, he finds that his life is in a great danger.
