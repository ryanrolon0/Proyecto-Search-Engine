The Summit

 Two hip-hop artists and their girlfriends embark on a road trip. The Boys focus is a much sought after gig waiting for them at the end of the trip. The girls focus is a relaxing time away and a much needed celebration for new things to come. Jacob and Sarah, the roller-coaster couple of the group have recently found out they are going to be parents. Taylor and Amy who are the newly engaged couple of the group are very happy and much in love. After cruising along and bumping into some unsettling locals the group decide to stop for an overnight at a town and check into a hotel called The Summit.
