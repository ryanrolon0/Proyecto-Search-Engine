The Opening

 Clinic is lost in dark folklore. The forest is dense and the sky a far reach. It would make anyone scream, yell, sob. If they could. What do you do when you're trapped? Trapped inside your own head because you've lost your voice? The Watchmaker wants to tinker inside and find the cogs and screws, take you apart and put you back together. The Blacksmith wants to use his hammer to beat out your screams. Clinic just wants to be free.
