We Must Have Music

 This short opens with 'Judy Garland (I)' (qv) singing, and dancing to, the title song. A short history of movie music is presented, from silent films accompanied by a single piano, to the elaborate song scores for musicals (with scenes from MGM's musicals) and background music for dramas. Conductor/composer 'Herbert Stothart' (qv) conducts the MGM studio orchestra recording the score for _Chocolate Soldier, The (1941)_ (qv). 'Busby Berkeley' (qv) directs a rehearsal of the "Hoedown" number from _Babes on Broadway (1941)_ (qv). The film ends with 'Risi Stevens' (qv) singing "America the Beautiful."
