The Steam Engine

 A disturbed neurologist succumbs to the demons possessing him and commits suicide. Years later his uninhabited estate is purchased by an unhappily married couple, Val and Jimmy. Soon, the neglected wife, Val, is being haunted by the doctor's ghost. She is aware of the doctor's fatal decision and struggles not to fall into the same trap as he did. It is a brief, yet, powerful look into the minds of people who, (depending on your point of view), foolishly or bravely search for the face of God. In the vast universe their tiny chugging is heard, "I think I can."
