Underbelly Blues

 Underbelly Blues is an insane black comedy heist caper following a mysterious briefcase as it exchanges hands amongst the colorful denizens of the L.A. underworld. These include a corrupt FBI agent, a sleazy strip club owner, a pair of vixen lesbian strippers, an O.C.D. hitman with a penchant for creative torture, a Jewish pickpocket and his dominatrix mother, a British sophisticate who cooks crystal meth, a legally blind albino gangster, a giant who loves sandwiches and a sexual deviant redneck with a Bruce Lee obsession. All of these characters are connected through a series of bizarre coincidences which inevitably lead to the downfall of corporate America as the rivalry between two soft drink companies goes out of control.
