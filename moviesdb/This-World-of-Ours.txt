This World of Ours

 We begin this travelogue in Colombo for a quick look at landmarks. Then it's on to Mt. Lavinia, the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kandy (city of the old kingdom), and the Temple of the Tooth. Miss Ceylon, wearing her sari, is our guide for part of the trip. Women enjoy more freedoms in Ceylon than in most of Asia, says the off-screen narrator. We see rickshaws, a juggler, a traditional dance, and the bathing elephants of Kandy.
