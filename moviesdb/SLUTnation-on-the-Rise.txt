SLUTnation on the Rise

 More and more teams have been forming within the growing sport of Ultimate, and one of them is the women's club team at Florida State University, the Seminole Ladies Ultimate Team, aka SLUT. The team was founded in the Fall of 2008, and it was comprised mostly of girls that were new to the sport. The Ladies soon realized that Ultimate involves far more than just tossing a Frisbee. It is a competitive sport with strategy and skill that takes practice to master. It was a rocky start, as S.L.U.T. began to compete as the underdog in tournaments against other schools. However, after learning how to work together as a team and have fun, they started scoring points, and even winning games!
