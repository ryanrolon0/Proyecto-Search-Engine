TR's Arrival in Africa

 A solitary tree, with few leaves but filled with large and small wild animals, dominates the left side of the frame. A monkey in the center looks right, out toward the horizon. He sees something and begins jumping up and down in exclamation and then quizzically. He runs back to the tree, looking over his shoulder. Coming up the hill into view, headed straight for the tree full of animals, carrying his rifle, and wearing his pith helmet and plus fours, is a grinning Teddy Roosevelt. What fate is in store for the animals?
