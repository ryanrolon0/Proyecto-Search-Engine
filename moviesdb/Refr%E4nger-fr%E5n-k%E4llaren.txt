 A documentary about the making of Roy Andersson's Sånger från andra våningen. The centre of gravity lies on the coming to existence of some central and controversial scenes. It's foremost Roy's way of building up the scenes, the thoughts behind, the film team's working procedure and the work with actors which are portrayed.
