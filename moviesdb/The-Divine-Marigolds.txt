The Divine Marigolds

 The Divine Marigolds is an off kilter family comedy about a large Irish family living in Seattle. All the adult children have moved back home, resulting in hilarious yet deeply affecting moments as they all learn to live under the same roof again. The Pilot Episode entitled "Homecoming" finds the eldest daughter, Cora Marigold, dropping in on the family at dinner time after a long absence. Old feuds, forgotten love, questionable art, a Twilight obsession and a kooky priest combine to make this family truly Divine and unforgettable.
