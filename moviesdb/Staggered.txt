Staggered

 Vyke Trevorsson has a problem and it has everything to do with him. Plagued by nightmares in his sleep and a shadowy figure in his waking hours, life has come to a grinding halt. Into this realm of paranoia and coincidence steps his old friend Jack- and Vyke can't help but wonder if he's there to help or really part of the problem.
