Teufelskicker

 Moritz loves soccer-football, and the sport club SV Hulstorf that his father trained is his home. It made it hard when his parents separated and he and his somewhat cranky "no idea about football"-mother have to move to his fierce Grandpa Rudi. Rudi resides precisely in the same city as the arrogant and wealthy Mark, the star of the local club VfB Eichstädt and fights against Moritz right from the start. Moritz finds new friends in passionate street kickers, the brothers Mehmet and Enes, Niko, the somewhat strange Alex and of course Catrina, piquant-wise Mark's sister, who has a ballerina's career. Gradually Grandpa Rudi unbends himself. When the vicious kickers decide to get together at the old club "Sportfreunde Blau-Gelb", they find out that their new coach Rudi himself formerly played there and was an excellent footballer. Shortly before their first major tournament suddenly Moritz's father appears to take him away again to Hulstorf. But Moritz recognizes that the game is now more important and wants to help his new friends. Moritz loves football. It hits him hard when his parents split up and he and his rather eccentric, "no idea about football" mother have to move in with his grumpy grandpa Rudi - far away from his home, friends and his beloved football club. Despite many obstacles he succeeds in setting up a new team and signs them up for the upcoming championship where they will face their fiercest rival and really have to prove themselves as a team.
