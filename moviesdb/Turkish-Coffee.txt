 Marcus Hall is a shy, reclusive ex-con who has few friends outside of his mother and is consumed by his infatuation for a young, beautiful next-door-neighbor, Claire. His passion for her is only matched by his hatred of her handsome, buff and tan boyfriend, Brad. Marcus seems destined for heartbreak, relegated to the margins of Claire's life. But then, while eavesdropping on a torrential argument between Claire and Brad, Marcus hears a crash and a thud, followed by gaping silence. He rushes to Claire's apartment and knocks on the door.
