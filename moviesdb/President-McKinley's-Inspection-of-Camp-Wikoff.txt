President McKinley's Inspection of Camp Wikoff

 "This picture has been very popular wherever it has been shown on the Biograph. To begin with, the film is unusually fine photographically, and the picture is taken from a point of view which shows the immense distances of Camp Wikoff with its multitude of tents in the background. The President, with Vice-President Hobart and Secretary of War Russell A. Alger, appear in an open carriage escorted by a large number of officers, notable among whom are Gen. Wheeler, Gen. Gates, and Col. John Jacob Astor. This picture is brought to a rather humorous ending by the efforts of a newspaper photographer to get Col. Astor to pose for a picture. He is unsuccessful, and as the gallant colonel gallops away, the photographer's chagrin is apparent."
