Transworld Skate & Create

 For the first time ever, a TransWorld TV show will be hitting the airwaves on an MTV network. Skate & Create II will have a one-hour special on MTV2. Now in its second year, S&C created the concept for this type of event. The special will be an exclusive look at the journeys of the four teams - etnies, C1RCA, DVS and DC - throughout the event. "Viewers will see all the drama and intense planning that went on during the two-month-long event," says Ken Lewis, TransWorld SKATEboarding's marketing and events director.
