The Full Treatment

 High-strung race car driver Alan Colby is trying to recover from a serious head injury. Alan and his lovely new wife Denise go on vacation to the South of France for some much needed rest and relaxation. But Alan is having trouble resisting his more violent impulses. Suave local psychiatrist David Prade offers to help Alan out. Race car driver Alan Colby survives a traumatic automobile accident with Denise, his beautiful Italian wife, but the other driver is unfortunately killed. His injuries are psychological as well as physical, and they go for a holiday on the Cote D'Azur before he returns to racing. He becomes obsessed by a compulsive urge to strangle Denise and dismember her body. While there they meet David Prade, a sophisticated and charming French psychiatrist, and Alan takes an immediate dislike to him. Denise believes he can help Alan and talks him into seeing Prade professionally in his London office. Alan reluctantly agrees to undergo Prade's "full treatment," which will regress him back to the time of the accident and get to the root of his obsession.
