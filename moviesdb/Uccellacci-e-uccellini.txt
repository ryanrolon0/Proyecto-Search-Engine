Uccellacci e uccellini

 On an empty road, an old man is walking with his son. They meet a crow that can speak. They are changed into monks and Saint Francois sent them to preach for hawks and sparrows. A reflexion about idealism. Innocenti Totò (Totò) and his son Innocenti Ninetto (Ninetto Davoli) are drifting in a road in Italy, when they meet a Marxist speaking crow. The trio travels together in a long journey, but when hunger increases, the crow is simply eaten by the drifters.
