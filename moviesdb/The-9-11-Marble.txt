The 9-11 Marble

 I try to use both art forms, film and marble making, to capture the essence of the day. This is an emotional day, and therefore an emotional film. Different people will feel differently, but it's the fact that you feel, that you experience emotion, THAT, is what I'm after, THAT is what I consider a compliment. It is What it is, It IS a movie about making a Marble, But, It's Not REALLY a Movie About making a Marble,... Really,.... Do You Understand?
