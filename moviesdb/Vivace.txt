Vivace

 A young couple, Pauline and Alex, moves from Paris to a quiet neighbourhood in the French countryside. Pauline loves to take care of her garden and the plants. She is also fascinated with her older neighbour Gilles who lives alone. They spend much time together and he helps her with her garden. Finally, he gives her a special plant from Brasil as a gift. The plant needs a lot of attention and is sensitive to the mood around it. As the plant grows, it takes up all of Paulines time which endangeres her relationship with Alex.
