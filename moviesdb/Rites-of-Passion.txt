Rites of Passion

 In Part I of this two-part anthology, a woman searches for both personal and sexual fulfillment. Part II tells of a self-described family-values crusader, "Mr. Morality," who goes to the TV studio to tape his weekly "pro-morality" show, but becomes entangled in his own sexual fantasies.
