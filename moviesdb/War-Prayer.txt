War Prayer

 Inspired by a Mark Twain short story, WAR PRAYER is an intense atmospheric film that takes the viewer through a surreal, ravaged landscape; it is a world that is vaguely familiar; recognizable, yet altogether unknown. Through thick clouds of choking gas, a Hero plants land mines; an Enemy pursues. When their paths collide, who will be left standing?
