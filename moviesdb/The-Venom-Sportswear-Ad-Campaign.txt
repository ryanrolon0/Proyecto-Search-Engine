The Venom Sportswear Ad Campaign

 A short film disguised as seven commercials for an underground Asian-American clothing line (the clothes are real, but the people are not), The Venom Sportswear Ad Campaign comments on the state of child endorsement deals in America as well as on the aspirations of Asian-American athletes and the societal pressures they face.
