Stranger Than Paradise

 This is about a self-styled New York hipster who is paid a surprise and quite unwelcome visit by his pretty sixteen-year-old Hungarian cousin. From initial hostility and indifference a strange affection grows between the two exiles. Due to complete boredom they decide to visit their aunt in the wastelands of Cleveland and then proceed to sunny Florida where they lose all their money and unwittingly gain a fortune. With a final ironic twist, they are at the end, back where they began. Willie is a pre-slacker-era slacker living in New York City. His cousin Eva from Hungary visits him for several days, and then goes to Cleveland to stay with their Aunt Lotte. One year later, Willie and his friend Eddie take a road trip to Cleveland to visit Eva and Aunt Lotte.
