Sailing and Village Band

 The second of UPA's split-reel cartoons in which there were two unrelated segments---one with Hattie and one with Ham---of 3.5 minutes each. The first one---Sailing" has young Hattie sailing her boat in a fountain and is quite dismayed when a frog sinks it. She brightens up when a friendly policeman restores it for her. The second unrelated segment---"The Village Band"--- features Hamilton Ham in the story of a village band that goes unappreciated by the populace until it is needed to greet a distinguished dignitary.
