The Musical Storytellers Ginger & Black

 Ginger and Black are musical storytellers who take their unique view of the world around the primary schools of the country. But when they arrive at 5B, the class of Mr. Hopkirk, they find an untenable situation - a teacher unable to cope with their unique vision. With songs about ancient kings, princesses and African tribes, they should be the perfect duo to entertain the kids. But somehow it doesn't quite work out that way, perhaps because they keep mentioning HIV and pedophiles.
