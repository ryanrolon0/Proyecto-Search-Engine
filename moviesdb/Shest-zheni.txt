Shest zheni

 In the 1988 Ruse town on the Danube River has been gas-polluted with chlorine emitted from chemical plant in Giurgiu, Romania. The then political leaders and statesman closed their eyes to environmental genocide, committed in this beautiful Bulgarian city. The protest rallies of the citizens set a precedent in this country's history after Communism swept to power in 1944. Six women, whose names have already been forgotten, staged the rallies.
