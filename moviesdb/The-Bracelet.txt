The Bracelet

 Two co-workers, a Slacker and a Straight-Laced Pencil Pusher, toil away at their web design company. The Pencil Pusher drills the Slacker about a new "Live Strong"-inspired bracelet he is wearing. After continuous probing, the Slacker reveals that the bracelet is in support of the "Robot Movement for Global Domination". The Pencil Pusher mocks the Slacker for such a foolhardy purchase. Later that day, the robots revolt. The Pencil Pusher is one of their first casualties. The Slacker is cornered by a deadly robot, but after showing him the bracelet, the slacker's life is spared, thereby proving the bracelet a worthwhile purchase.
