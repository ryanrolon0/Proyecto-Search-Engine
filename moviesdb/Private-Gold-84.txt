Private Gold 84

 Sonnen and Traley manage to escape from the Jodi temple now conquered by the Seth. Dart Forsennt follows the Jodi to their secret base on a forest moon and decides to sacrifice her fellow Seth, Klanz. This entices padawan traitor Gracery Knightly to turn on Forsennt and come up with a plan for the Jodi to defeat the Seth once and for all.
