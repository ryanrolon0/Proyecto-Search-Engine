The Living and the Dead

 You are a simple, country doctor in a small village. You have a beautiful wife and a wonderful son - the perfect life. Only they don't know that in your past, you did a very bad thing! People died because of it, and you were forced to flee and live incognito. Now, in an opportunity to redeem yourself, you unwittingly unleash a brutal and perverse murderer, a deviant sociopath hell bent on using innocent people in a Grand Guignol of flesh and blood - a veritable nineteenth-century snuff theater. You alone can end his reign of sick terror - but at the risk of revealing your secret past and losing everything you love. Only you don't know what's worse - what you've created - or what you have to do to stop him!
