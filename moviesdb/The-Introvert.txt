The Introvert

 The story of a nameless young man, the everyday man, who has chosen to create his own oasis within the real and modern age; the world of dynamism, change, unpredictability, overstimulation, and danger for a more safe and comfortable yet limited and stagnant one. This young man is so disconnected with the world that he almost seems pathetic. One fateful day, Achilles, his cat and only companion escapes his home revealing an emotional void within the protagonist. The subsequent chain of events forces him to realize that he must conquer his fears of the outside world in order for him to regain what has been lost. Upon realizing that he possess the power to change, the young man journeys into the outside world in search for his cat only to discover that a world where only he exists is the same as not existing and that there are others outside his apartment that share similar interests to his.
