The Misteak

 Chase, in post-mortem narration, pronounces himself dead than proceeds to revisit the dinner preparation and casual date night that resulted in his comic pseudo-death. An indy romantic comedy follows this ADD helpless romantic as he gets a bit carried away and ruins the date of a lifetime yet in the end realizes there are always more fish in the sea.
