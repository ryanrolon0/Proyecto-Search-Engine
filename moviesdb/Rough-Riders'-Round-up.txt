Rough Riders' Round-up

 When Roy, Rusty, and Tommy join the Border Patrol, Tommy gets killed in a saloon fight by Arizona Jack. Suspended from duty, Roy and Rusty cross the border looking for the killer. Arizona Jack and mining engineer Lanning are running a gold smuggling racket and when Roy and Rusty find Arizona's hideout, his gang captures them and they are slated to be killed. Now that the Spanish-American was is over, Roy and other Rough Riders become border patrolmen. Their goal is to stop outlaws who are stealing gold from stage coaches and express offices.
