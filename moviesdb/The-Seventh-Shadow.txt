The Seventh Shadow

 1949 horrifying elder beings from another dimension are using cults on Earth to facilitate their enslavement of humanity - he assembles former comrades, associates, and even old enemies in order to combat the menace. Alongside him fight his former assistant, granted superhuman powers, as well as a Canadian soldier, a Russian soldier, an American mobster, a Spanish anarchist, and a jaded beat cop. Against them are arrayed a host of grotesque extra-dimensional creatures, and the mutated human leader of their cult. Humanity's last hope is The Seventh Shadow, but will it be enough to turn back the tide?
