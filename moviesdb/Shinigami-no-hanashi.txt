Shinigami no hanashi

 A modern tale based on the traditional Japanese comedy (Rakugo) 'The Reaper' and the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale 'Godfather Death'. An economic use of character and props allows this story to expand its scope freely in the dark. Daisuke is married with a son but is unemployed. His wife grows tired of him and one day kicks him out. Without any place to go, he decides to die. Suddenly, the Grim Reaper appears in front of him. Instead of taking Daisuke's life, the Reaper unexpectedly teaches him how to save others from death. Soon, Daisuke becomes a famous healer. Everything seems to be going well until his son gets seriously ill. According to the Reaper's rules, the boy cannot be saved. Can Daisuke cheat death?
