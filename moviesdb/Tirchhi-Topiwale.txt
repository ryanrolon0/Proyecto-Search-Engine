Tirchhi Topiwale

 Anand (Chunky Pandey) is a small-time con artist. He has fallen in love with a rich and wealthy girl, Shikha Oberoi. Shikha also has fallen in love with Anand, but her parents want her to marry Amit Mehra (Inder Kumar). On Amit's arrival, Anand tries to influence him by force to abandon any thoughts of Shikha, but he is unsuccessful. Amit, on a chance meeting with Sanam (Ritu Parna), falls in love with her. But Sanam does not appreciate him. The family's elders ask the youngsters to go for military training with a very strict and intimidating trainer, Kadak K. Pillay (Johnny Lever), with hopes that this will straighten them.
