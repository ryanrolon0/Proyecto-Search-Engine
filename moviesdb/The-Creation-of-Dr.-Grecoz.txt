The Creation of Dr. Grecoz

 Dr. Grecoz, a corrupt eye surgeon who has developed a way to transplant another person's eyes into the blind, has set fire to his house in a desperate attempt to kill his wife and be closer to his son. But when all is done, it is his son who is burned and blinded in the fire. Now, with no hope for the future and only home videos of his youth to remind him of what he used to have, Billy will learn the truth about his father through the eyes of his mother.
