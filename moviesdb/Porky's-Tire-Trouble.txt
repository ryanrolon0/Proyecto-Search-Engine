Porky's Tire Trouble

 Porky works at the Snappy Rubber Company. His dog, Flat Foot Flookey, is determined to follow him into the plant, despite the rules. And Flookey's clumsiness means he's not exactly going to be able to sneak in like when he falls into a vat of rubberizing solution, and molds his face into a number of then-popular movie stars, or makes Porky's boss (a walrus) drop a stack of tires.
