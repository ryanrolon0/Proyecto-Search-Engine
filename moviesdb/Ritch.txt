Ritch

 Ritch is the moody tale of a hip-hop sensation and his return home. Ritch's intimate concert for his hometown entourage offers the photo opportunity of a lifetime to his number one fans Kinzo and Mozie. Ritch however has different plans. The film explodes open in a music-video style with an urban score, a shiny hip-hop star, the bling, the girls and the fans, but then quickly settles into four minutes of beautifully crafted storytelling. Complimented by an evocative neo-noir look, RITCH suggests that within the shadows lies a different truth, as Kinzo and Mozie are about to find out. RITCH is a modern adaptation of Richard Cory, Pulitzer Prize winning poet Edwin Arlington Robinsons' shockingly ironic poem about loneliness.
