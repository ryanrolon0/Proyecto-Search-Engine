The World According to Straw

 Hilarious but sadly unappreciated would-be sitcom about a conniving head janitor known only as Straw who secretly manipulates the affairs of a non-descript New York City office building for his own personal gain. In the pilot episode, he seeks to improve working conditions for himself and his staff by stealing toilet paper from the Chief Executive Officers of the Board.
