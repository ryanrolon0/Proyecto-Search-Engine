The Mirror

 An exploration of questions of identity, self-worth and mortality from a female perspective. A woman discovers a magic mirror that channels the voices of famous women from the path including Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickinson and Anne Frank. The quotes are paired with footage from contemporary women's lives. Finally, the mirror shows her a glimpse of her own future. Created using appropriated footage from the Internet combined with original artwork and footage by Crisanta de Guzman.
