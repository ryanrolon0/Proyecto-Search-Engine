The Bird Tribes

 "The Bird Tribes" is a visual poem combining Native American spirituality, mysticism and a strong anti-war message; several themes that are central to my view of the world. Beginning with the pain, brutality and emotional devastation of human cruelty and tragedy, and centered by a heartbreaking emotional performance by Natia Dune as Maria, the film slowly transforms and brings the viewer into a mysterious world of mystical and sexual ecstasy and a celebration of our greater connection to the oneness of all things and all dimensions.
