Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi

 Pretty Sadhana, the daughter of Rangpur-based widow, Bhagmati, falls in love, and gets married to Haripur-based Deepak Chaudhary, who lives with his dad, Motilal; and mom, Maya. It is here she will find that her mom expects her to abuse Maya, and drive her out; while Bhagmati herself abuses her very own daughter-in-law, Lajwanti, for not bringing any dowry, and prevents her submissive son, Kanhaiya, from being intimate with her. Sadhana will also find out why Motilal and Maya do not converse with each other directly, and why the former keeps a photo-less frame in the main living room of their mansion.
