 The Casper, Wyoming rodeo is the site for a look at the rules and techniques for rodeo contests bareback bronc-riding, and bull riding. With each, the off-screen narrator explains some of the rules, and we watch riders' perform. Once the bull riding starts, the role of the clowns is essential. The narrator also explains the tough life of the rodeo performer travel, and his entrance fees, and being paid only if he finishes among the top performers. The short ends with highlights from the Casper rodeo.
