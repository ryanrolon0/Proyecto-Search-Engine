The Good Cop

 In a stark interview room a man is questioned by a 'good cop'. The cop pays the man several visits, offering him chocolate and a warm towel, but can make no headway with him. In between his visits the man waits patiently. Eventually the cop uncovers the problem. His tactics aren't working because a vital component has been missing from the interrogation - the 'bad cop'.
