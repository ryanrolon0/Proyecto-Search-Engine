In an effort to regain his own recognition as a true crime journalist Jonah accepts an unlikely assignment given to him to seek out information regarding a string of gruesome murders being reported around the Red Light District, a desolate part of the city that serves as a haven for criminal activity. An assignment that serves as a life changing event for Jonah when he becomes witness to the brutal homicide of a prostitute who is murdered by the same psychopath responsible for all of the prior killings being discovered around the Red Light District. Things go from bad to worse for Jonah after suddenly receiving a gift from an anonymous "fan". An unusual gift that lands him face to face with the only one capable of saving his career by any means necessary.
