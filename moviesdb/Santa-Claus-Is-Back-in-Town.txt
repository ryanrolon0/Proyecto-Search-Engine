Santa Claus Is Back in Town

 At Christmas night, in the city's streets, a young Santa Claus, Sam, is giving candies to the people passing by, when he's mugged by a bunch of young angry people. Sam is saved by another Santa Claus, John. Then John takes Sam with him and they start to rob the houses of a wealthy neighborhood. But Sam is bitter about his behavior and he convince John to distribute some of the presents they just robbed to a disadvantaged hometown. But sadly, they'll choose the wrong house to perform their salvation.
