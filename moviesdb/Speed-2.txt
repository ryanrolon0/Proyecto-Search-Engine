Speed 2

 Annie and her policeman boyfriend Alex decide to take a romantic ocean cruise together. Once at sea, however, one of the passengers, a disgruntled computer genius named Giger, disables the ship. Alex must now foil Giger's plans and bring everyone back safely to shore, but how can he outwit a man who can control the entire ship from his keyboard? Annie Porter is thrilled when her boyfriend Alex Shaw presents her with two tickets for a cruise to the Bahamas on a Norwegian luxury liner. The trip is a peace offering presented because Annie has just learned that Alex is a police officer who's been lying to her about his choice of profession. Alex lied because Annie didn't want to date any more cops after what happened with the bus in Los Angeles. The cruise ship's passengers include members of a diamond dealers' association, who have filled the ship's vault with valuable diamonds. Little do they know that passenger John Geiger, the designer of the ship's computer system, has planned to take over the ship, steal the diamonds, and set the ship on a collision course with an oil tanker anchored at the island of St. Martin. Geiger was fired and cast aside by the computer company he worked for, and he wants revenge. Now it's up to Alex to stop him.
