Una historia de invierno

 There is an old man. His tired hands pluck the feathers off a chicken and throw them into a bucket. Time passes slowly but without stopping. There is a window, a dog, a photograph. There is a clock, a lit fireplace, a spider. The water drips in the dark well. White landscape out of the bedroom; sometimes it's daytime, sometimes it's night. The spider eats a fly. Tick-tock, tick-tock, sings the clock. The dog opens her eyes and struggles to survive. Tick-tock, tick-tock. The bucket gets filled with feathers. Crack, crack, the fire slowly dies. "Una Historia de Invierno" is a poetic vision of disappearance and isolation.
