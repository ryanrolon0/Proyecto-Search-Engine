The Secret Language of Girls

 In an effort to define The Secret Language of Girls, filmmaker Tara Johns and journalist Josey Vogels become part of a great female-bonding phenomenon - the all-chick road trip. Their ensuing relationship with each other, as well as with their all-female crew and the wildly diverse women they meet along the way, provides the backbone for an unflinching story of female bonding (and breaking) on the road.
