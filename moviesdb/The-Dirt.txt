The Dirt

 A subtle mix of horror, thriller and drama, THE DIRT, centers on a married woman, a photographer, and her all-consuming wish to have a child. During the course of the film, this woman develops a very morbid relationship with an unusual plant that grows in her living room, one that holds many secrets-but none as dark as the woman has herself.
