Red Red Red

 A personal and political film about a law in Iowa that severely limits the social liberties of people with HIV. Eclectic in the presentation of its rhetoric, the film also considers broader questions like the contemporary state of queer politics, the dimensions of an identity for HIV-positive persons, and how it is that a local convenience store chain came to be called Kum 'N Go.
