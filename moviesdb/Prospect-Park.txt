Prospect Park

 In the summer of 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture secretly rounded up and killed all 400 geese in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. The U.S.D.A. later told the press that the geese presented a threat to airplanes, a claim vigorously denied by residents and wildlife advocates. Dr. Bruce Weinstein, better known to CNN viewers and BusinessWeek readers as 'The Ethics Guy,' filmed the geese before the slaughter, simply to have a record of these beautiful animals in their natural setting. That footage is now imbued with an unmistakable sense of sadness and loss. But nature has had other plans in store for Prospect Park, as the surprise ending of this documentary short reveals.
