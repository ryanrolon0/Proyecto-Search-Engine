Solara

 A group of people, from different walks of life are interrupted from their day-to-day life by their desires to make a difference. Slowly they are all drawn to the exact same location in the hot, Mojave desert. Once there, it becomes clear what they must do. With dynamic, languid movement and with an intense determination to connect with their environment and with each other, they collectively take a journey. As the energy builds, the winds pick up, the day slowly begins to pass, and the sweet reward of rain is showered. Solara is about the passions that move us, the energies that flow from us, and about the changes that occur thereafter.
