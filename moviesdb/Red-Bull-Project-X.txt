Red Bull Project X

 In the winter of 2009, deep in the back country of Colorado, Shaun White and Red Bull embarked on a project like nothing the snowboard world had ever seen. A back-country Super Pipe was sculpted out of the rugged San Juan Mountains, becoming the foundation for a training ground that would test the limits of both man and machine. Completely hidden from the outside world, it would become a session that would redefine the progression of snowboarding... this is Red Bull Project X.
