Tribulations of a Country Schoolmarm

 "Another view of a school interior. The schoolmarm has just put a naughty boy on the dunce's chair, and proceeds down the aisle to speak to one of the children, when the naughty boy fishes for her wig with the blackboard pointer and a bent pin. He succeeds in catching it and hauls it off, greatly to the delight of all the youngsters in the school."
