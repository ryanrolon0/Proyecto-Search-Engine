Tempted

 Workaholic Mike grudgingly minds the kids while his wife, legal assistant Emma Burke, flies to Hawai with ashes of Lily, the native who raised her and came to Boston with her. On the minor Hawaian island, Emma finally gets acquainted (again) with her family, and decides to stay, also to help with their flower nursery's legal problems. She also learns her biological mother is alive and well on the island, but refuses to talk to her now and starts an ill-considered affair with handsome cousin Kala. Mike flies in with the two children, complicating everything further. Emma Burke, an unhappily married mother of two, arrives in Hawaii to attend the funeral of Lily, the woman who raised her since infancy. While she's sad about her surrogate mom's death, she also grateful for the chance to escape the demands of her busy, but unfulfilling, life in Boston. Soon Emma's emotional life becomes even more complicated when she has a dalliance with Lily's handsome nephew, Kala. The younger man's easygoing ways provide a source of comfort, especially after Emma learns that the birth mother she never knew lives on the island. Balancing a taxing job, a marriage and two children (including one teenage hellion), working mom Emma is slowly reaching the end of her rope. But all that is about to change when she takes a trip to her childhood home on Kauai, a beautiful Hawaiian island, to participate in ho'o ponopono, a customary burial ceremony, for Lily, the nurse who raised her. However, Emma's adventure in this tropical paradise involves much more than saying goodbye to an old friend. She will not only find herself being drawn into a passionate tryst with a local islander, but she'll also meet Julia, the mother she thought had died years ago! Emma's journey through these turbulent times is ultimately one of self-discovery.
