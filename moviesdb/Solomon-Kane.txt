Solomon Kane

 Once a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth I fighting Spaniards in Africa, He met the Devil's Reaper and discovered he was bound for hell! Barely escaping he soon renounced violence to atone for his past sins, seeking out redemption in a life of peace. That is until the followers of priest turned sorcerer Malachi kidnap a Puritan girl Meredith Crowthorn and brutally slaughter her family before his very own eyes (including butchering her beloved younger brother Samuel who Solomon had befriended)! Forcing Solomon to take up arms and return to his violent ways once more to rescue her! In doing so means returning to his birthplace and facing his older brother Marcus who (in his youth) he accidentally left disfigured (and for dead), who now serves as merciless enforcer to Malachi. Based on the comic books by Robert E. Howard. Solomon Kane is a bloodthirsty English pirate who, after taking an Ottoman city in North Africa lost his soul to the devil. Kane renounces to violence and retires to a monastery in England, struggling for living as a "man of peace" since then. Soon the evil will reach him, forcing him to come back to the battle.
