Shaheed

 Hadi is a young man consumed by a hate of humanity and faith in God so strong, that leads him to commit the ultimate sacrifice. His fate lies in the hands of a purgatory judge, Josef Brenner, who is faced with the dilemma of redeeming young Hadi or sacrificing his own immortality. Judge Saul, Heaven's supreme council leader, forces his will upon Hadi's status, inducing this young martyr into the Garden of Eden and into his ranks of followers. So creates the conflict within the walls of "Shaheed".
