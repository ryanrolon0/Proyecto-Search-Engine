Ti-Jean in the Land of Iron

 Nothing is too difficult or scary for Ti-Jean, a ten year old boy living on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River in QuEbec. Once he hears about it, he decides to travel by horseback on his faithful mount, Princess, to the land of the iron ore on the north side of the river, where he wants to work in the mines. Getting there is not quite as Ti-Jean expects, but no obstacle is too insurmountable. Along the way, he acts as a one-person cargo loader to pay for his ferry trip across the river, the ferry which he captains, and he flies an airplane. Once in Schefferville, the center of the mining country, Ti-Jean, without question, pays his penance for a wrong deed, but ultimately gets his wish by singlehandedly saving the mine from potential disaster. From there, Ti-Jean also changes the entire economic fortune of the mine for all concerned. Once his work there is done, Ti-Jean is off to his next adventure.
