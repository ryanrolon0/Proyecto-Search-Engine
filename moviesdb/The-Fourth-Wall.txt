The Fourth Wall

 Imagine if you woke up one morning and realized that your entire life had been edited into a movie. You could hear musical scores, your own voice overs, see opening credits, and worst of all...feel the cuts, transitions and edits from one scene to the next. Would you embrace this new reality or do whatever you could to escape the reign it now had over your entire ninety minute life?
