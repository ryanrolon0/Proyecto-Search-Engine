The Other Side of My Rainbow

 Escaping small-town America, to Germany and beyond, the filmmaker struggles with cultural, political, and familial awakenings in this personal documentary. Other world travelers' uncannily similar stories weave a broader picture that is emotionally more engrossing and insightful, making her adventure both familiar and personal. A film of quiet transformation, THE OTHER SIDE OF MY RAINBOW illustrates how growth and understanding challenges ordinary people.
