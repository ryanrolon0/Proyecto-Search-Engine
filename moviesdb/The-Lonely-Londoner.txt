The Lonely Londoner

 At the opening of our film there exists two separate worlds in Balham - the world of the young professional and the world of the unemployed - each containing a character upon whom we focus the audiences' interest. Our drama consists in the collision of these two worlds that changes the lives of two people who stand in direct opposition to each other. Both of these worlds rarely come into contact with each other except through the persons of Michael King and Clare Kelly.
