There's Music in Your Hair

 A music concert is disrupted, first by some weak buttons, and more notably by the bubble gum the violin soloist is chewing. Before that, the soloist annoys the conductor with an overly extended solo. The tubas keep blowing a toupee among the various bald musicians. Even though he gets increasingly tangled up in the sticky bubble gum, the violinist manages to play most of his notes (though he has to pluck a few when his bow is stuck).
