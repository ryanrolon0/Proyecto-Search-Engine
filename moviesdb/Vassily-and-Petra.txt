Vassily and Petra

 Vassily and Petra are brother and sister. The pair share a unique bond; not only are they siblings, they're bound together by neglect, forced to live in a home where they are exposed to their parents' arguments, night after night. The two children attempt to use their imagination and ingenuity to escape the constant sound of their parents arguing, but it proves ineffective. However, when they find a tape recorder in a dusty attic, the pair hatch a plan to record the sound of silence - something they have never experienced. Venturing off into night-time London, the pair finally find 'silence' on a roof top, high above the sleeping city.
