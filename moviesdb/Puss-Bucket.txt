Puss Bucket

 Two religious maniacs, Judas (played by Terrence Fleming) and Corned Beef (played by Eric Hammer), are visited by two aliens, Madeline Virbasius and Dion. Virbasius, dressed as the Virgin Mary, tells the two to kill people for Jesus and to drain the puss from their heads and bring it back to them. Fleming and Hammer set out to bring "the Virgin Mary" back as much puss back as possible in a bucket (hence the title).
