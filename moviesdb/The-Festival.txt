The Festival

 Julian Rachlin asked his childhood friend Aleksey Igudesman to make a movie about the 10th year of his festival in Dubrovnik. And he got more than what he reckoned for. Or less. We are not sure yet. Anyhow, he got Sebastian Leitner on board and all went downhill from then. Or uphill if you are standing on your head. Look, whatever, just watch the damn thing when it comes out.
