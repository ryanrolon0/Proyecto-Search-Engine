Still Crazy

 "Strange Fruit" had everything that makes a legendary rockband Fame, Success, Groupies, a Singer who died of drugs and even a divine ending, when lightning struck the stage during an open-air. Twenty years later, all band members are minding their own businesses, the idea of a band reunion is brought up by, well, public request. Tony, the former keyboard player, sets out only to find his former friends working as a roofer, a gardener and a hotel clerk. They all became rather everyday people, married or still single, they definitely are not wild and crazy anymore. But with the help of former manager Karen, who is still dreaming of Brian, the apparently deceased lead guitarist, they all, old, fat and wrinkled as they are, try to catch that spirit again. In the seventies Strange Fruit were it. They lived the rock lifestyle to the max, groupies, drugs, internal tension and an ex front man dead from an overdose. Even their demise was glamorous; when lightning struck the stage during an outdoor festival. 20 years on and these former rock gods they have now sunk deep into obscurity when the idea of a reunion tour is lodged in the head of Tony, former keyboard player of the Fruits. Tony sets out to find his former bandmates with the help of former manager Karen to see if they can recapture the magic and give themselves a second chance.
