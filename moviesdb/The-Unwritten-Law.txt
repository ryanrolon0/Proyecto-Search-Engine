The Unwritten Law

 Following an opening reel inside a movie studio where a 'talkie' is being filmed, the participants board a ship to go on location trip where, as they say in show business blurbs, comedy, love, passion, revenge, mystery and murder stalk the decks. The stalkee is movie producer Roger Morgan, who majors in seduction of women...and the stalkers include exotic foreign star whom he has cast aside for the fresh-and-innocent Mary Evans; Ruth's mother, whose smoldering hatred for Morgan, who wronged her years before, flames into new fire when she learns of his interest in her daughter; the studio electrician whose sister Morgan deflowered; Val Lewis, the young director who loves Ruth; and last, but not least, Ruth's father who Morgan had tossed into a ravine in Africa years before, and broke camp and took his wife and baby daughter with him. And a couple of the ship's crew members don't appear to care much for him, either.
