The Road to Nkunda

 Do you know what it takes to make a film on an African Rebel in the Democratic Republic of Congo? ... Neither did we. In a region where war has raged for many years, 5.4 million people have died, and almost no news ever comes out of the region, filmmaker Douglas Busby and Tony Arbini, along with their fixer Pastor Marion, find themselves on an unpredictable quest for an answer. What are they fighting for? There is no handbook to prepare them for what they are about to experience as they push forward towards the ultimate prize, General Nkunda himself. Along the way, they witness firsthand, the devastating effects of war in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps and orphanages and find themselves in situations very few westerners could even imagine. After unsuccessful negotiations with the United Nations and the Congolese Army, they forge ahead, without permission, to find the elusive Rebel General. Upon arriving in his remote mountain village, the filmmakers are faced with the unthinkable, are they guests or hostages? Their courage, wit and tenacity are tested to the limits, as they not only strive to get their story, but also flee the country without being arrested.
