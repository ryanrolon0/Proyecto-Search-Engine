The Race Against Cancer

 The Race Against Cancer was an event hosted at the end of 2007 aimed at bringing together some of the brightest talents in motorsport together for a one off kart race. Many international names flew in for what turned out to be a spectacular final race and a thoroughly enjoyable day of racing. All proceeds of the event were donated to Cancer Research UK.
