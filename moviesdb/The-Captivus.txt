The Captivus

 Rabidus and Vaccus have been friends for six years. The problem is, all of these years they have been forced to be with each other aboard a tiny, cramped, rescue ship, while they search deep space for The Libertas - a missing transport freighter. With their equipment failing, and tensions reaching a peak, the men get a transmission from base, that Rabidus is leaving The Captivus and going home. After this news hit's the ship - things go horribly wrong.
