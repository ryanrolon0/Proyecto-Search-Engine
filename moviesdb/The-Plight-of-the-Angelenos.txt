The Plight of the Angelenos

 This is the tale of the world's most misunderstood creatures - the Angelenos. This tongue-in-cheek documentary explores the Angelenos' mission lives! Created entirely from stock footage and film clips with the tone of a 1950s-era educational film, this tale explores how entertainment is created; from its stars to its studio executives; and finds out why Angelenos are so uniquely suited to this calling. This satire takes a look at a world that's begging to be spoofed!
