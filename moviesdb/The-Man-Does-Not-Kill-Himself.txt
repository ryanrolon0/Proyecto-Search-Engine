The Man Does Not Kill Himself

 Michael is a frustrated, depressed young man, who has lost his family and work. The 'devil Michael' takes over the 'good Michael' and kills him. For everyone else it's a suicide but the film reveals how it wasn't a suicide at all, but a murder. The film tells us that when a man commits suicide, he isn't himself but a depressed and changed human being who ends up killing the good part and thus ending a life; which, in legal language, might be a suicide but actually isn't.
