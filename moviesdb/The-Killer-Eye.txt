The Killer Eye

 An ophthamologist is trying to develop a technique for seeing into another dimension. After a previous experiment went terribly wrong, blinding his test subject he makes some revisions to his methodology. Unfortunately, his latest experiment is a horrible success. His newest test subject peers into another dimension and is killed by an extra-dimensional entity which enters our world and infests the eye of the subject. After expanding to enormous size and detaching from the body of its victim, the eye goes on a rampage.
