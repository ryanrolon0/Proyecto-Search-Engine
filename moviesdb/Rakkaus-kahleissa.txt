Rakkaus kahleissa

 One of two brothers working in a lock factory gets caught after participating in a burglary. He insists they didn't take anything after all, yet millions of Finnish marks are missing. Meanwhile, his seemingly virtuous older brother, who was not supposed to have anything to do with the burglary, seems to have some secrets on his conscience.
