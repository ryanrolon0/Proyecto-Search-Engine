The Helpless Hippo

 The jungle animals and creatures have all come to the point where they are living together in peace and harmony, thanks to the efforts of the great Mighty Mouse. But the peace is broken when the buzzards attack a helpless baby hippo. The super hero is kept busy fighting off the attacks of the sneaky buzzards while also catering to the needs and whims of the hippo. Finally, after the attackers are vanquished, all the animal parents leave their babies with Mighty Mouse as their baby-sitter.
