The Waiters' Ball

 The workers at a diner are looking forward to the waiters' ball in the evening, at which full dress is required. First, they must get through a busy day with many customers. Later in the day, dress clothes for the cook and the dishwasher are delivered from the cleaners. The waiter has nothing appropriate to wear, but he is determined to go anyway.
