The Voice

 The Voice is a documentary about an interactive story created by the Interactive Performance Lab and set all around Orlando. A group of trained inter-actors and a dedicated crew of digital media students created a fictional reality in which two non-actors, who did not know what was going to happen, could play the lead characters and make it up as they went. The two non-actors play the roles of Anne Davis and Ken Garner. Davis is a young reporter whose online multi-media column, ThE-Voice, has just been picked up for syndication. Garner is the right-hand man for a millionaire developer who wants to keep the public from knowing about his latest project, Florida Springs. Anne's cousin, Eddie, spoils their plan and is subsequently thrown in jail. After Anne bails Eddie out of jail, she realizes this could be the big story she's been waiting for. What is Rosetta-Corp hiding? Is she tough enough to stand up to Garner and his slick boss?
