Tum Yeh Kehtay Ho Ab Koee Charah Nahin

 This is an experimental short film based on a poem by the famous Pakistani poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1914-1984). The poem refers to the state of mind in a time of struggle, which ironically reflects the current times of turmoil faced by the people of Pakistan. This film attempts to capture the emotion of the poem.
