Starman on Duty

 The world is not run by humans. Part-testimony and part-instruction, Starman On Duty contains a bare knuckle presentation by a genuine nonhuman (ET in human form). Delving into extremely controversial topics, the film unveils the real situation of nonhumans on earth which will contradict every notion of interstellar aliens propagated over decades of disinformation, deception and censorship.
