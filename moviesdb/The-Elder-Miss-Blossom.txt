The Elder Miss Blossom

 Miss Blossom passes through middle age caring for her widowed brother and his only child, a daughter. A handsome explorer returns from an expedition and meets the family, whereupon he falls in love with the daughter. He departs for another long expedition, leaving behind a message regarding his intent to marry the daughter upon his return. But the message is misdirected to the elder Miss Blossom, who secretly loves the explorer and now awaits his return from far-off lands in joyous expectation of their marriage.
