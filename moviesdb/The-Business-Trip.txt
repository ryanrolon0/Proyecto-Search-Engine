The Business Trip

 Angela can't stand her ineffectual work colleague Dave. After a long haul flight and the realization that Dave has forgotten to book their hotel rooms, she's close to breaking point. A sympathetic hotelier offers them the only room left, it's a single and Dave snores horribly. This and an unexpected discovery will take Angela well beyond breaking point - but she's going to make damn sure David comes with her.
