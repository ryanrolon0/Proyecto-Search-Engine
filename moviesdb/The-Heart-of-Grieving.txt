The Heart of Grieving

 Against the backdrop of San Francisco's Day of the Dead, the arduous, and at times ecstatic, process of grieving is shared in the stories of four people dying; Marcia, a spiritually-guided newly-wed and widow; Gladys, the compassionate church-friend of an HIV positive man abandoned by his family; and Geoff, an only-son coping with the double loss of his mother to cancer and his father to suicide. From diagnosis to death to mourning, the film explores the heart and soul of grief.
