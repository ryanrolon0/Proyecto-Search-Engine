The Third Girl from the Left

 A chorus girl comes to the realization that she is not getting any younger and that her longtime relationship with a nightclub comedian is going nowhere. She finds herself attracted to an unassuming but attentive--and much younger--delivery boy. An aging chorus girl finally comes to the realization that her long-running affair with a nightclub comic has no future. She soon begins to notice that a good-looking, and much younger, delivery boy is paying a lot of attention to her.
