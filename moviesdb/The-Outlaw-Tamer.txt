The Outlaw Tamer

 Fleeing from the law, a wounded Tex Broderick is taken in by Jean Bennett. Later she has him deliver a large amount of money. When saloon owner Bowie and his men attack and take the money, the Sheriff jails Tex for that and his previous crime. Jean lets him out and he captures Bowie and the money. But the arriving posse still thinks he's a wanted man and he is shot. A mysterious masked bandit chased by Sheriff Jim Porter 'J.P. McGowan' (qv)) and his posse escapes but is wounded. The sheriff, who is infatuated with Jean Bennett ('Blanche Mehaffey' (qv)), who owns a store in Sagbrush, visits her just as prospector "Cactus" Barnes ('George 'Gabby' Hayes' (qv)) is obtaining a grubstake from her to aid him in his search for a lost mine. That night, a badly wounded "Tex" Broderick seeks refuge in Jean's store, and she shields and nurses him back to health. Barnes makes a lucky strike and and heads for the saloon, operated by Bowie Harris ('Slim Whitaker' (qv)), who lures Barnes into a poker game. "Tex" hears that Barnes is being cheated out of his money, and knowing that part of it belongs to Jean, goes to the Ace High Saloon and intervenes. He breaks into the saloon safe to recover the gold Harris cheated Barnes out of but is detected and escapes. Porter is now after "Tex" for both robbery and cattle rustling.
