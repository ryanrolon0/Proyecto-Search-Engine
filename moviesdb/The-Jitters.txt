The Jitters

 Asian vampires that hop like kangaroos can only be stopped by gluing paper to their foreheads. Really! Oh yeah, the paper has to have oriental writing, in blood, on it to work. A rich Chinatown merchant is murdered by a street gang. The merchant's son and assistant bring him back to life as a vampire, and he and other vampires fight the street gang.
