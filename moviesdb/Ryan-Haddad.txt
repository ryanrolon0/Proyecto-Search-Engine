 Ryan Haddad submitted this video in response to Oprah's search for talented kids. In it his family describes his struggles as a person with a disability and the talents that he has showcased despite his challenges. Ryan conducted the interviews and pieced them together with family photos and videos in this short documentary format. Though he never heard from The Oprah Show, he is very proud of this video, which wonderfully demonstrates his family's love for him, as well as their ongoing support of his ambitions and goals.
