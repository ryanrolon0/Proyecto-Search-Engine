The Persistent Resistance of Vision

 This film is a parody of the medium of moving image itself. It makes reference to the optical illusionary toy the thaumotrope and makes the underlying optical illusion of moving image a deliberate part of the film style. Through this a disjointed slapstick narrative is woven.
