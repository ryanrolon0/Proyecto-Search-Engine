Tête à tête à tête

 A three headed robot has just awaken to start its day. Everything in the robot's life is in three, one for each of the heads. And each of those three is the same as each head has the same mentality. Things start to go awry when it goes to the milliner's shop looking to get three hats to protect their heads from the snow. Two heads agree while the third doesn't. While this non-sympatico nature causes a problem internally with the robot, the problem becomes less so after it meets another robot with a similar problem.
