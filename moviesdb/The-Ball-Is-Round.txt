The Ball Is Round

 Jakarta 1 November, 2007. The Ball is Round is a soccer comedy for all ages that is set in BOLANESIA, a fictional land with events loosely based on the corrupt Indonesian league. The story tells the tale of two rivaling soccer teams. The expensively assembled BLACK BRIGADES, owned by Dam As "Abramovich" Lubis, a candidate in the coming governor election, and SAVAGE SHEEP FC, a privately owned club that relies on youth development. When the owner of the SAVAGE SHEEP FC died from a mid-game heart attack, the government sees it as the perfect opportunity to acquire Savage Sheep FC, allowing for a larger fan base and supporters for Dam As' political campaign. However, the attempted merger is thwarted when the estranged daughter of the Savage Sheep FC owner, decides to take over the team and continue her father's legacy. But being a female leader in a male dominant sport, especially in a patriarchal society like BOLANESIA was never going to be easy, the fans are against her, the media are against her, and even her coaches and playing staff are against her. The BALL IS ROUND tells the story of how she finds triumph in one of the funniest and unlikely football underdog story, filled with hilarious and exciting soccer sequence.
