Toning and Shaping

 Jane offers an exciting new dimension to her home video series. In this tape, a 45 minute beginner/intermediate program and a 40 minute intermediate/advanced program are offered. Both use dumbbells, ankle weights, and a flat bench to help build strength and muscle tone. With her personal trainer, Dan Isaacson, exercise enthusiasts are instructed on proper form, methods of use, and tips on proper weight training.
