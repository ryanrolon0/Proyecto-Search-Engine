Razkazi za ubiystva

 A father murdered his son. In a state of alcoholic delirium, a youth murdered his friend. A 21 year-old boy shot a policeman... Three people who have taken a life. Faced with their own death - the death sentence - they tell about what happens with them at the moment when they are between death and...death. This film is a documentary attempt to look Evil in the eye. The Evil that everyone has in the dark side of his soul, which 'makes us understand what Good means'...
