Unfinished Business

 Stewart and Hannah were your typical young couple searching for their dream home until a freak encounter at an old house saw a long expired life flash before Stewart's eyes, as if it were his own. Violent, unpredictable memories and a hauntingly familiar face drive Stewart to solve this mystery for the sake of his own sanity. "Unfinished Business" explores the consequences of an ill deed, seemingly long forgotten. The film is set simultaneously in modern Australia, as well as 1945 immediately after World War II. It explores a returning soldier's life, ruined by the actions of a once trusted friend, in what was to become a common scenario for all too many returning Diggers
