The Vampire in the Hole

 Vampirism is a newly discovered viral illness whose initial stages spread as quickly as the flu. May has just turned seventeen and has become infected. She is the only vampire in her family and her neighborhood and, as such, her life changes dramatically. In her daily surroundings she is now seen as a monster However, May tries to adapt by following the rules and norms set by the government on infected citizens who wish to fit back into society. Opinion is divided about what should be done with the "infected". Should one accept them, or reject them? And this division foreshadows a future war where racism and intolerance will hasten the inevitable, definitive rift between humans and vampires.
