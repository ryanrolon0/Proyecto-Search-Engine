Stolen Security Guard

 Ginger and Ivy rob a jewelry store and kidnap their beautiful security guard to ensure that they aren't followed by the police. Once they arrive at their hideout, an abandoned warehouse, the crooks decide to play with their bound, gagged and blindfolded captive; but soon the security guard escapes and the crooks are placed in a similar predicament. The guard can't find the hidden jewels, though, and in desperation allows the criminals to escape, hoping they'll lead her to the gems. The guard guesses wrong - soon the crooks have recaptured the buxom brunette and torment her with a vibrator for the punishment she inflicted on he criminals.
