Sabre Wulf

 The newest sequel to the original Sabre Wulf from the ZX Spectrum/Commodore 64 (which had non-related sequels only featuring Sabre Man himself) has the wolf set free from the statue he was imprisoned in, at the end of the first game, by the nefarious Dr. Dolittle-Goode. The Sabre Wulf wrecks havoc on the quiet town of Blackwyche, stealing their treasures and hogging them all for himself. Luckily Sabre Man, now getting on in his years, is camping nearby and the townspeople call on him to help. As Sabre Man you must use a variety of wacky animals to neutralize the bad creatures in order to get to Sabre Wolf and steal back the treasures and the 8 pieces of the shattered amulet that keeps the wolf at bay in his statue prison.
