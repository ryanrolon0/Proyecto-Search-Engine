The Rising Tide Documentary

 Despite his promise of "No new taxes", in 1990 President George HW Bush signed a budget package that included a new Luxury Tax. This simple act, while necessary to get the budget approved, dealt a devastating blow to the US yacht building industry. Among those impacted by the new tax were the employees of Viking Yachts in New Jersey. After the suicide of one of their employees, Viking's owners, Bill and Bob Healey, mounted an aggressive campaign to repeal the Luxury Tax. Determined to spare their company from bankruptcy, the brothers' tireless, three-year battle also helped to save an industry.
