Suite of Summer Evenings

 In lyric, observational form, Suite of Summer Evenings conjures a landscape of languid yet energized evenings, carnival nights with the coughing cars of dirt track auto racing in rural upstate New York. Crafted as a suite of four distinct movements, the piece is redolent of tones and moods. Immersed in ambient landscape, sound and image are symbiotic, each sense massaged with timbre and textures, evoking a place that is simultaneously mythic and quotidian; a serene, raucous, visceral, and luminous world.
