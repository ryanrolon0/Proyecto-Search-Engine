The Threesome

 In the vain of comedies by The Farrelly Brothers, Judd Apatow or Kevin Smith, where the language is dirty, the women are sexy, and the story is stupid comes The Threesome, a comedy about two friends that fall for the same girl. Owen (Eric Carpenter) has always dreamed of having a threesome. His best friend Hank (Spenser Genesy) has always dreamed of finding the love of his life. When both friends fall hard for Charlie (Jessica DiGiovanni) their lives take a turn for the hilarious.
