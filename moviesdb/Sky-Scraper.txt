Sky Scraper

 High in the midst of towering Manhattan skyscrapers, bodies of flesh and bones drift between sky and concrete. Their shelter is a rooftop shrouded by a rising mist and a fierce wind. As the mist billows and isolates a couple, their longing becomes more pronounced. Their dance is that of separation and union. Till the fog progressively engulfs skyscrapers, humans and all in between. Choreographed by Nadine Helstroffer.
