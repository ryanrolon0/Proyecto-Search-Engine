The King Chronicle, Part 2

 Having survived the Customs Scandal, Canadian politician Mackenzie King finds himself in yet another bitter struggle, the King-Byng Affair. After his loss to Bennett's Conservatives in the 1930 election, King secretly turns to spiritualism in order to make contact with his mother and others of the "great beyond."
