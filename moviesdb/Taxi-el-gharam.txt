Taxi el gharam

 The film starts by introducing Abdo, a poor taxi driver with a phenomenal voice. We soon meet Elham, a rich young lady, who was left in the care of her tyrant uncle when her father died. She escapes, as her uncle is trying to force her to marry an ugly, stupid man she has no feelings for. Elham hails a taxi to take her away, and Abdo happens to be the driver. When her uncle comes to take her back and force her to marry the suitor he has chosen, Elham protests, pretending that she has married the taxi driver Abdo. Abdo plays along and actually does marry her, so there will be a marriage certificate. Elham falls in love with Abdo, but despite his love for her, he doesn't believe that two people from such different social classes can be together. Abdo travels to Alexandria to make money singing, and Elham pretends to be her own twin sister Yasmin, a character she's made up who sings in Alexandria but is poor. When the ruse is revealed to Abdo, he divorces Elham and leaves her uncle to take her home against her will. Abdo realizes his mistake almost immediately, and goes to rescue her from her uncle, who reveals that Elham's fortune has been spent. Elham and Abdo remarry.
