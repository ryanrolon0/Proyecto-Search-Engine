Sexually Submissive

 Naomi is dissatisfied with her current boyfriend George, and all her past boyfriends because they don't measure up to Blake, her best friend Courtney's husband. During a weekend retreat, Naomi and Blake begin a very passionate and deeply romantic affair. Naomi is torn between destroying her best friend's marriage or losing her true love. Blake is torn between the two women, both of whom he truly loves. Will Naomi sacrifice her true love for her best friend, or will she destroy Courtney's marriage for the sake of her own true love, or will Naomi and Blake's secret be discovered before they decide what to do?
