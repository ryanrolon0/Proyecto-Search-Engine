Snaps of Love

 Snaps of Love is a short romantic drama involving a love triangle between three very different people! When Sophie's fiance, Jason becomes hospitalised and his once nice demeanour changes, she begins to wonder if his true colours are now showing. To add to the mix, Jason's doctor seems a little too interested in his patient's fiance...Time's running out. What will Sophie do?? With this film I hope the audience can find characters they relate to, in situations we've all been in. At the same time I also hope they can laugh and find the film entertaining!
