The Survivors

 For 2 years, the camera follows daily life of Zhari police station which stands on the front line of the Taliban war. Bombs, death and poverty are just a part of the everyday life here. In the summer of 2009, Taliban's assault becomes heavier and Zhari station becomes more dangerous place to be. As their family and friends starve and die, the policemen join the Taliban while the allied forces chase after them. As winter arrives, Zhari police station has become a place no one can reach without military escorts. So many people have gone yet the war still continues.
