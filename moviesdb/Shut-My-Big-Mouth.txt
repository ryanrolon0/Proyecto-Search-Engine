Shut My Big Mouth

 Wellington Holmes, a timid horticulturist, heads for Big Bluff. When the stage is held up by Buckskin Bill and his men, he accidentally knocks out three of them earning himself the unwanted job of Marshall. Escaping town disguised as a woman, the stage is again held up by Buckskin and he, Elena Montoya and her father are made prisoners. He escapes and when Buckskin arrives in town he again accidentally overpowers him. Having been previously masked, Buckskin now claims to be Buckskin's enemy and the townspeople believe him. They release him and offer him the reward for leading Wellington to Buckskin's hideout. So Wellington and Elena with the ransom money for her father, but no posse, head out to bring in Buckskin.
