The New Girl on the Block

 While Sharon and Mitch await the arrival of an interviewee, the two women lament over the laziness of the current crop of youthful models. By the time young Lauren shows up, the older women have aroused their hostility to such an extent the younger woman is quickly stripped, bound, gagged and teased. Lauren is pretty resourceful; she soon escapes her bonds and captures the older women one by one, leaving them bound and helpless. Or maybe not so helpless, because Mitch soon slips out of the hogtie meant to hold her and the frisky blonde is soon in peril again.
