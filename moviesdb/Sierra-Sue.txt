Sierra Sue

 Gene is a government inspector looking into what's killing cattle. The ranchers want to burn the area to clear of a poisonous weed, but Gene favors chemical spray from an airplane. To fight a poisonous weed, ranchers are burning their land. Gene is the Inspector brought in and he recommends spraying. The spraying goes well until the Larabee ranch is reached. When Larrabee refuses to allow the equipment on his land, Gene has it sprayed by airplane. Cattle must stay off recently sprayed land and when a Larrabee man shoots down the plane, the crash sends the cattle stampeding toward the newly sprayed land.
