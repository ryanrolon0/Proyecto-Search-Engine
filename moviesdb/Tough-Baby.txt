Tough Baby

 Made the year after her Oscar nominated triumph - RKO's "Sudden Fear", Joan Crawford was determined to make her MGM comeback armed with a great set of gams, a second-rate script and a few recycled musical numbers including the shockingly-wrong blackface number, "Two-Faced Woman!" The film was a resoundng flop in it's day, but has become among her most beloved cult hits decades later.
