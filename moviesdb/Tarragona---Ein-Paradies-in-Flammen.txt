Tarragona - Ein Paradies in Flammen

 The "Los Alfaques" campground is a much-loved, much-visited holiday destination. Reveling holidaymakers, families, groups, couples and singles. Lots of skin, fun and frolicking on the beach. The blazing sun, the rush of the waves, the carefree racket kicked up by the children are what make "Los Alfaques" a seaside paradise. Nothing seems able to destroy this idyllic scene. People on holiday to light problems which are normally put up with or suppressed in the day-to-day routine. On holiday, feelings, anxieties, hopes and wishes are, so to speak, lived and experienced under intensified conditions. When, in situations like these, life itself is thrown into deadly danger, every decision must be made directly in the face of eternity. Everything unspoken and unfinished threatens to become a lifelong curse. In extreme situations, human beings turn to what is really important to them. The otherwise-so-obvious option of making good for something becomes a precious thing. Only the living can forgive! It is the terrible, unforeseeable accidents and catastrophes, things that can happen at any time, that demonstrate to people the value of life. "Tarragona" tells the story of one such catastrophe. There's the young, patchwork family on the way to their first holiday together. There's the teenage couple, tenting in Spain together for the first time without their parents' knowledge. There's the old and terminally ill military officer who, on the last holiday of his life, wants to reconcile with his gay son. There's the unhappy wife whose dominating husband cheats on and humiliates her. And there's the driver of the truck that, without his knowledge, has been drastically overloaded. And his son, who tries to stop the catastrophe from happening.
