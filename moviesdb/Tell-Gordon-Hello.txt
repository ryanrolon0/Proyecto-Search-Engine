Tell Gordon Hello

 Tell Gordon Hello was spawned off of Morgan Rodner's love of two things film and comics. During a writer's block that all artists come across at some point in their lifetime, Rodner met Paul Louis Harrell while directing another short film. Rodner soon discovered that Harrell had a pastime of playing the Joker on Hollywood Blvd for tips which was the catalyst that put the wheels into motion for Tell Gordon Hello. After developing the story with Bryan Wolfson, Morgan presented a finished script to Casey Schendel. Together they found a cast and crew of friends and colleagues, all of whom shared a collective love of Nolan and Ledger's dark and brutal portrayal of the Joker. With a budget next to nothing, the biggest obstacle the team faced was finding a location. By chance, Casey was able to procure a 35,000 sq. ft. warehouse that was not only ideal, but at no cost thanks to ATB Studios. Zilla Lighting generously donated use of all their lighting & grip equipment and the RED camera was lent out by a close friend of Rodner and Schendel's. Tell Gordon Hello grew from a scene that was to be shot in a dark garage on HD to a piece of real production value shot on the RED in a legitimate warehouse. It quickly became apparent to all involved that Tell Gordon Hello would not be just an ordinary short film. The cast and crew's colossal dedication and determination allowed them to produce a film that exceeded their expectations in every aspect imaginable. This may just be the definitive joker fan film.
