Saving Sin City

 Charts the struggles of ex-prostitute, and self styled Mother Theresa to the working girls of Las Vegas, Annie Lobert, as she builds her "Hookers for Jesus" ministry. With a set that goes beyond the bright lights of the strip, to the prisons, juvenile detention centers, churches, and sleazy clubs and with a cast that includes teenage hookers, cops, pastors and pimps, "Saving Sin City" takes the audience into a world that they have only glimpsed fictional versions of in movies, confounding expectations and stereotypes at each turn.
