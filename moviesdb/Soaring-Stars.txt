Soaring Stars

 The horses and jockeys usually at Santa Anita Park have given way this day to an air show. A cavalcade of movie stars are there, flying planes, being passengers in planes, taking an active role in the event proceedings or watching the event along with the throngs of movie and airplane fans. Among the fans are two women, whose main goal is to get as many autographs of their favorite movie stars as possible. In their quest, they get into one predicament after another, including being implicated in the mysterious disappearance of a bracelet belonging to actress 'Ruth Hussey' (qv). They also get a little closer to the actual air show than they were originally intending.
