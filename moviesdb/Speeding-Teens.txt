Speeding Teens

 This short film was written by Mario Revolori (16) and Tony Revolori (14), it was also directed by the Revolori brothers and edited by Tony. The song chose for the film was written by Mario and Tony and the singer is Mario, and all instruments are played by Mario and Tony. The recording was done at the Rev Q Productions owned by Mario and Tony and their father Mario Quinones Revolori. Our hope is to show teenagers that we need to be responsible and listen to our parents when we take the wheel as teens. We need to learn to be safe on the road and bring safety on the highways for everybody. Working together parents and teens we can.
