Something in the Clearing

 Reminincent of Hitchcock's style, Rosemary's Baby and the Bad Seed, Something in the Clearing is a cult classic. A family in turmoil returns to the small town where David, the father, had grown up. Their return to the countryside takes them into the middle of generational abuse and Satanic practices only to find help in an unexpected way.
