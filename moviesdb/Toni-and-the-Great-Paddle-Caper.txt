Toni and the Great Paddle Caper

 Toni knows that she is supposed to stay away from her mom's precious knick-knacks. But when she disobeys and breaks her mother's vase, she knows she's in for the spanking of a lifetime. To avoid punishment, she hides the paddle her mother uses to spank her, but the paddle has other ideas. Will Toni beat the paddle? Or will the paddle beat Toni?
