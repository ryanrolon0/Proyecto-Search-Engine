The Plot Sickens

 A little nebbish spends his evenings watching the back of his massive wife's head, as she cackles at violent westerns on TV. At first he has fantasies of making Zenita magically vanish. But why dream of supernatural powers when there are so many natural ways of making someone disappear? There's poison, for instance. But Zenita proves impervious to poison and to his increasingly outrageous murder weapons.
