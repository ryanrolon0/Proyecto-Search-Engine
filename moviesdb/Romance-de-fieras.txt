Romance de fieras

 One morning, Javier Ponce ('Joaquín Cordero' (qv)), a young unemployed lawyer, is buying the newspaper when he hears a gunshot in a cafe nearby. He enters and sees a middle-aged man with a gun in his hand, who demands the services of a lawyer. Javier offers his services to the man, who turns out to be wealthy businessman Don Carlos Narváez ('Carlos Orellana' (qv)) and claims just having shot his best friend, yet he won't explain his motivations and wants to avoid any further investigations. Soon, Don Carlos' son Ricardo ('Armando Calvo' (qv)) steps in, and behaves very arrogantly to Javier. The young lawyer gets Don Carlos absolved, and he in turn makes Javier his administrator, much to Ricardo's disgust. Some time later, Javier discovers a lonely house where a strange woman plays the piano, and starts getting obsessed with her. When Don Carlos dies he leaves a letter to Javier explaining him that he accused himself of the crime to avoid a scandal for Gabriela, the deceased man's daughter, whom Ricardo had had sex with and then left without marrying her (something unacceptable for Mexico in the 1950s), so Don Carlos is leaving all his inheritance to Gabriela. Now, Javier must find Gabriela, whose current location is unknown, before Ricardo does...
