The Dollhouse

 The graceful old house by the creek may seem like the perfectly wholesome setting for beautiful Wendy White and her angelic six-year-old daughter, Lilly. While Lilly enjoys playing with her dolls, her mother delights in toying with the men she draws to her door. But things aren't always what they seem... You see, deep down inside, Wendy is a very bad girl.
