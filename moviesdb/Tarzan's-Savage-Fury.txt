Tarzan's Savage Fury

 Tarzan's cousin comes to Africa in hopes that Tarzan will help him secure a fortune in diamonds essential to England's military security. The cousin is immediately killed off by his guide Rokov who persuades Edwards to impersonate the cousin. Joey (Boy's substitute) was used by natives as crocodile bate until Tarzan rescued him.
