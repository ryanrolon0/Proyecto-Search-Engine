The Monroe Doctrine

 This two-reel short tells the tale of the effects of the Monroe Document in a historical and historical-fictional manner, and its effects---fact and fictional---in North and South America...and Europe and,how through the years, various U.S. Presidents have upheld it in various ways. The ending has Theodore Roosevelt delivering a speech that probably left the viewing audiences, in various countries, talking about it in various languages.
