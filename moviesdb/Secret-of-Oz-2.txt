Secret of Oz 2

 The problem with the economy of every nation on earth is debt. Governments don't need to borrow their national money into existence. A national debt puts unelectable bankers in control of the quantity of the national money and thereby in control of the national politics. That's our problem today. We don't just print our money. We borrow every dollar we have in our economy and then pay interest on it. So, we actually rent our money -- mostly from the biggest banks. A sovereign nation can and should create its own money without such debt. That's the secret of Oz.
