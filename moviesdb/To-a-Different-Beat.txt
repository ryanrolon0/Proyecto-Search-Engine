To a Different Beat

 In this film, three major municiple police forces in Canada, United Kingdom and The United States are featured with the serious problems faced they faced in their operations and their solutions. Running through each is the emphasis on community policing that deemphasizes the violent confrontational approach to the citizenry and back to the sense of being a more cooperative and mutually supportive element to society.
