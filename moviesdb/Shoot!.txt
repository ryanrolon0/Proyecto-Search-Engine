Shoot!

 Twice a year, thousands of machine gun enthusiasts converge on a small plot of land in rural Kentucky to take part in the largest machine gun shoot in the world. There are numerous competitions over the weekend and a young girl and her father are regular entrees. The only difference is that she will now be competing in the men's division . . . and accordingly against her own father.
