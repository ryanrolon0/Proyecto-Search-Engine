The Broadway Buckaroo

 Through the terms of a will in which he inherits a lot of money if he will run a dude ranch for six months and get away from the city, Red figures out a plan to build a night-club dude ranch on Broadway, so he will not have to abandon his beloved Broadway night-life. He hires the Condos Brothers (Nick, Frank and Harry) to do their dance routines, and the trick-roping act of Maidie & Ray. Red supplies his own brand of emceeing the acts, while the music is supplied by Hank Lawson and His Texans.
