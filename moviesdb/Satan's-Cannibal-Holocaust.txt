Satan's Cannibal Holocaust

 Kelly, a young journalist, is working on her next big article about her father, the local mayor. It is a seemingly innocent piece on the wonderful things being done for the community. Little does she know that the deeper she digs, the closer she comes to a secret which lurks beneath the streets of her peaceful city...a secret many will kill to protect. Soon, the violence erupts in the subterranean catacombs. Shrieks of terror echo through the tunnels as the gore gushes forth. Innocent victims are held captive and brutalized. Naked bodies are torn open and eaten. Here, beneath the city, an evil is growing...and Kelly will witness firsthand the horror of SATAN'S CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST
