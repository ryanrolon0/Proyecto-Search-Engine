The Blue Butterfly

 Based on a true story, The Blue Butterfly tells the story of a terminally ill 10-year-old boy whose dream is to catch the most beautiful butterfly on Earth, the mythic and elusive Blue Morpho. His mother persuades a renowned entomologist to take them on a trip to the jungle to search for the butterfly, leading to an adventure that will transform their lives. Adolescent Pete Carlton has been diagnosed with a brain tumor, with the doctors giving him three to six months to live. He has written to and telephoned entomologist Alan Osborn, host of the television show "Insects". Based on Alan's on-air statements that seeing the blue morpho butterfly, a magical creature in his mind, transformed his life, Pete wants to accompany Alan on a trip to the tropical rain forest to capture a live specimen for himself. Alan reluctantly agrees, his reluctance based on the fact that the season for this butterfly is nearing its end, the trip will be difficult because of Pete's wheelchair-bound status, and that Alan admits that he is a not good with children. Accompanying them is Pete's caring single mother, the tropical rain forest-phobic Teresa Carlton. As they search for the elusive butterfly, Alan learns from Pete the importance of following one's dreams, while Pete learns from Alan's friend's daughter, Yana, the importance of taking in all that life has to offer in the moment. These lessons come amidst some obstacles, both emotional and physical.
