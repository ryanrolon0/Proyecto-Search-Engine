The Crimson Trail

 When Jim Bellair is shot, Jimmy Carter follows the trail to a cabin where he overhears that Luke Long did it. Captured by the gang, he is able to escape and returns to the Bellair ranch. Learning that Long has kidnapped Kitty Bellair and is heading for the border, he sets out after them. Jim Bellaire and Frank Carter are rival ranchers and political opponents, and when Bellaire is shot, Carter is accused of the shooting and rustling. Carter's nephew, Bill, comes to his aid, saves his uncle from being lynched and falls in love with Bellaire's daughter, Kitty, which complicates his task.
