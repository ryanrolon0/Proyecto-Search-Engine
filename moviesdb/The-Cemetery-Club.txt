The Cemetery Club

 This comedy with much Jewish humor is about the widows Doris, Ester and Lucille, who's husbands died one after another in just a few years. The 3 friends in their 50s react quite differently on the deaths. But they make it a habit to meet every year at the graves of their husbands and talk about perspectives in their lives.
