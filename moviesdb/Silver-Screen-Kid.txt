Silver Screen Kid

 Harry Grisham is having a bad day. He sips what is to be his final drink and stares down a train that is fast approaching his car; he can't believe what's happened in the past few days. He feels he will die the loser he always felt he was. Not only was he never taken seriously as a journalist, but now he may have just accidentally killed one of America's most beloved child movie stars since Shirley Temple.
