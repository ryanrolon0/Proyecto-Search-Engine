Tom Dowd & the Language of Music

 If you picked some of the all-time great albums in American rock, soul, and jazz, chances are one name might be found on the back of almost every one Tom Dowd--the secret behind five decades of brilliant music, an unsung hero, producer and recording pioneer. From the perfection of live mixing to the introduction of eight-track recording, the mythology of exactly how much impact Dowd has had is still up for grabs. His diverse and genuine love of work is remembered in part through intimate interviews with several musical icons and personal friends.
