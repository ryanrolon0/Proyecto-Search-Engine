The Devil Takes Tomorrow

 Dave Taylor has everything you could hope for surgeon, a loving wife, two adoring kids; a father in law who could buy and sell the world ten times over, until he wakes up in a mental hospital, informed that he has murdered his family in cold blood. He has no memory of the killing; his mind is a blank slate. Meanwhile his doctor is engaging him in destructive, radical therapies, and the chief orderly is abusing him with impunity. His only ally is a kindly and mysterious ward nurse. Nothing is quite right at this hospital. Told by his doctors to "trust in dreams", DAVE puts the pieces together. As his memory restores itself little by little, and events from his past converge with a volatile present, DAVE discovers that nothing in his world is what it seems.
