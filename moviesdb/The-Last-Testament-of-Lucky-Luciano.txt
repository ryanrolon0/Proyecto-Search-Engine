The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano

 The incredible story of how Lucky Luciano known as the "Chairman of the Board" of La Cosa Nostra - The Mafia - used his power to aid the US Government during WWII to help protect the docks and mainland from Nazi saboteurs and further helped the Allies with the invasion of Europe. His rise to power from obscurity, his modernization of an organization of very flawed characters, his deportation to Italy, and in his final chapter his falling in love for the first time ever with Igea Lusconi, and his death from undetermined causes. Luciano and his gang, having eliminated the old gang 'bosses' and their antiquated and inefficient business practices, he reorganized the mafia into a crime syndicate. When Luciano is framed and wrongfully convicted for running prostitution rings, he serves 10 years in prison and is then exiled to Italy where he discovers love and life outside the mafia.
