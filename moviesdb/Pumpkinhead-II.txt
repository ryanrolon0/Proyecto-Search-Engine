Pumpkinhead II

 After a group of teenagers indirectly cause an old witch to be burned, they accidently revive Pumpkinhead. This time Pumpkinhead is inhabited by the soul of a deformed orphan killed 30 years before. He goes on a bloody rampage after his tormentors and the teenagers. Meanwhile, a local sheriff tries to solve the mystery and stop the murders. The soul of the deformed boy that was killed in the original film is re-awakened in the form of a grotesque monster that seeks revenge against those who originally killed him and against the teens who brought him back.
