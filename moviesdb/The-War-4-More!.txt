The War 4 More!

 When a not-so-talented rocker meets a girl at the bar after his gig and agrees to help her shoot a guerrilla student documentary--he ends up in a fight for his life behind the walls of a secretive gated community where families engage in the most primitive form of social networking--organized war. A celebration of low-tech, low budget, non-collaborative film-making, 'The War 4 More' is a cobbling of action, comedy, original music, sex, and violence. Try to imagine the first thirty minutes of a big budget script realized (without actors) by a filmmaker working solo in a cramped studio with stop-animated action figures (filmed through a magnifying lens hot-glued to a web-cam.)
