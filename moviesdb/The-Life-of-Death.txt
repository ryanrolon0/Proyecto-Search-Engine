The Life of Death

 The office of death is where the collected so-called angels of death work with making sure of that us humans die at the planned moment in our lives. Among these office workers is Thane, a burnt out employee who doesn't know what to do anymore. He is fed up with his immortal life and never ending job. He never wanted to work there in the first place. Instead his dreams have always been to work as a guardian, someone who stops a killing when the office of death have made a mistake, someone who gets to preform miracles. Caught between a tough boss and co-workers he doesn't like, Thane's attitude towards his profession will cause him to make mistakes, one of which will change his future.
