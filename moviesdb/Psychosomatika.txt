Psychosomatika

 Lionel Perkins awakens from a coma only to find himself in the middle of what he believes to be an alternate reality - an adaptation of his own life. Remembering only bits and pieces of his past, he begins to wonder if these vague memories of the life he once had are merely masking a much deeper truth? Just why is it that everyone around him seems to have a laundry list of secrets of their own? Why does everyone in his town seem to be a squeaky clean sitcom version of "themselves?" Will he be able to put the pieces together?
