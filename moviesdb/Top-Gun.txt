Top Gun

 Maverick, Goose, Iceman and Viper roar into the sky again in Top Gun for the PlayStation Network. Top Gun is a free-flying air combat shooter where players blast enemies out of the sky in dogfight battles, obliterate ground and air-based targets and show off their extreme flying prowess as Maverick. With their Radar Intercept Officer Goose, players enroll at flight school to go up against the best for Top Gun honors. Following graduation, players fly into the danger zone with other US Navy pilots over the Indian Ocean, where they can shoot down MiGs, defend and attack bases and engage in large-scale dogfight battles. Top Gun also features five multi-player modes, where up to sixteen players can relive the thrills from the film and interactively experience US Navy combat!
