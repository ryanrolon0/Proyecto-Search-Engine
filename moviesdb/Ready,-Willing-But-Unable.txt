Ready, Willing But Unable

 Truck drivers Olley (El Brendel) and Tom (Tom Kennedy) run over a tailor's dummy and believe it is a man, and they need to dispose of the body. They mistake the grounds of a girl's seminary for a cemetery and are discovered while digging a grave. They run into the dormitory where the girl students are sleeping.
