Training for Trouble

 Two unemployed vaudeville hoofers, Gus Schilling and Richard Lane, are rehearsing their act with Simoleon, the monkey, in their boarding house. The residents below them are upset and complain about the noise. When they finally land a job in a show, they learn that the leading man in the show (Sid Fields) is their down-stairs neighbor who complained so strenously about their noise. A version of "A Pain in the Pullman, 1936" with the Three Stooges.
