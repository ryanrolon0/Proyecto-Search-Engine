The Notorious Colonel Steel

 War has always been mankind's most terrible creation. Even in the midst of war, there's a line that most men never cross. Beyond this line, there is only chaos and monstrosity. From the ashes of America's bloodiest conflict, The War Between the States, there arose the legend of a man who appeared when that line was crossed....a man who traveled the countryside fighting for those who had no champion.
