 The film is a portrait of Vic Paraninfo, a Sicilian-Canadian cobbler, whose work bridges the gap between the old and new world. We watch as Paraninfo goes about his daily routine of tacking and gumming soles, tanning and skate sharpening, all while offering his hard-earned take on the vulnerability and civic responsibility of the 21st Century shopkeeper.
