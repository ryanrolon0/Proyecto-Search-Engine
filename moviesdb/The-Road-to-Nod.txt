The Road to Nod

 THE ROAD TO NOD is a narcotic and brooding tale of wrong decisions and their inevitable and desultory consequences. The film is at its roots an Old Testament tragedy. Shot in stark high contrast black and white the film bears resemblance to classic film noirs and the genre of the Road Movie. The otherworldly Irish landscape, long tracking shots and the hallucinogenic blues soundtrack lend the film a peculiar rhythm and atmosphere.
