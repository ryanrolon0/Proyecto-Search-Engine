The Big Gusher

 Oil-field roughnecks Kenny Blake and Hank Mason, on a drinking spree with Betsy Abbott, buy a piece of worthless oil land from conman Jim Tolman. Cappy Groves, a diviner, locates oil on the property and Betsy arranges to rent drilling equipment from Tolman, with a stipulation that if oil isn't struck within sixty days, the property lease reverts to Tolman.
