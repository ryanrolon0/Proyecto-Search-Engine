Thicker ThanWater

 Trapped within New York State's vast acres of fallow farmland, 19 year-old Lana cares for an ailing mother while waiting for something more. When Roy, her brother, arrives after a 2-year absence, both siblings will discover exactly how fragile, and strong, are the ties that bind us to one another. A poetic exploration of life's choices and the consequences for those who leave and those that stay behind.
