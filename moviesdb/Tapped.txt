Tapped

 Jim knew everything in his life was in order, until the day he walked into the salon for his ritual haircut. There he met the new girl, Crystal. He's unprepared. For both her and her "mystical" ex-friend Jaime, who is out to "right" one of Crystal's past "wrongs." In "Tapped," you'll follow the ups and downs of their sometimes beautiful, often tortured relationship that was built on the blood of others...all the way...to the end?
