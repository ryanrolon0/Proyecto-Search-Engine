Sweet Lorraine

 In its heyday, the Lorraine Hotel saw its fair share of guests, laughter and good times. But now that the aging inn is well past its prime, owner Lillian Garber must decide whether to repair the Catskills landmark - or sell to developers. As Lillian and her zany staff enjoy what may be the Lorraine's best- and last-summer season, they realize that not even a wrecking ball can demolish life's sweetest treasures. A slice-of-life comedy about old friendships, new romance, and letting go of the past.
