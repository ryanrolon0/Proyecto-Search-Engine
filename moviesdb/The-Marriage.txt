The Marriage

 Building on the potential of his installation in the isle of San Giorgio, Greenaway imagines that Aretino commissioned Veronese to paint The Marriage of Christ. Veronese, more than prepared to shock, began painting a grand wedding banquet. Cardinals returning from the Counter-Reformation Council of Trent arrested Aretino for blasphemy. This forced Veronese to convert his painting into The Wedding at Cana. Tradition says that a liberated Aretino, pleased of his mocking gesture, died laughing.
