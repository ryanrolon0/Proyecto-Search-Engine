The Nick at Nite Holiday Special

 When "The Blizzard of the Century" hits the Nick At NIte Lodge, the busy holiday season is ruined. But stranded celebrites keep showing up to wait out the storm and suddenly the Lodge is filled with music, laugher and holiday cheer. A highly entertaining, family-friendly throwback to holiday specials of a byegone era, it includes a variety of musical performances, familiar faces from past television shows and a surprisingly diverse holiday theme that encompasses Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.
