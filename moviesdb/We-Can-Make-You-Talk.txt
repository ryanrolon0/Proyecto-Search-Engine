We Can Make You Talk

 This documentary is also part reality show. A dozen volunteers are set a mission to fulfil, but one by one they are captured by interrogators. They are held for a weekend, blindfolded and shackled and subjected to the same interrogation techniques talked about in the documentary. One by one they crack and tell their captors everything they know. They are made to talk!
