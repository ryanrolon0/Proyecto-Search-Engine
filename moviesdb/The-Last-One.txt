The Last One

 A man races against time to prevent the unthinkable from happening to the one he loves. The Last One is one man's journey home, where the consequences of the choices he's made slowly begin to unravel in front of him. As Alex recovers from a gunfight and comes to his senses, he realizes that his life and that of his girlfriend Abbie are in grave danger. Unable to reach her, Alex must now make the long journey back to Abbie before the people he's crossed get to her first. It won't be an easy task, as Alex is confronted by police and hunted down by a lone gunman. His only hope lies in the form of a stranger, whom he has taken hostage. As they drive into the night, Alex begins to realize just how important his relationship is, and now, he can only hope he is not too late to save it.
