Reprise

 The starting point is a short film from 1968, showing the end of the strike in the Wonder factory in Saint-Ouen (France) dissatisfied with the negotiated compromise and refuses to return to work. The Team takes up the lane trying to find this woman and gives all those involved the chance to reassess the situation which happened 27 years ago.
