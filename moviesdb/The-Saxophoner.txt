The Saxophoner

 A passing man is lured into watching a busker's saxophone for him whilst he goes off to take care of something. He meets a series of characters related and unrelated to the busker and has to deal with the series of events that ensue. A nice guy gets caught up in drama just because he's a nice guy.
