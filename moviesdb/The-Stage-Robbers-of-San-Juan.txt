The Stage Robbers of San Juan

 One day after a successful hold up, Slippery Jim is dividing the haul between Tom Haley, his partner, his wife, and himself, when Tom objects to Slippery's wife sharing in the plunder. Slippery thinks otherwise as the risk is as great for his wife as it is to them. Tom becomes abusive and Slippery resents it with a blow. Tom departs in anger, and riding toward town, he comes upon a sign recently posted by the Sheriff, offering $1000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the San Juan Stage Robbers. A plan forms itself in his mind to be revenged on Slippery, and also obtain the reward money. Riding to the Sheriff's house, he tells him that he will take him to the stage robbers. The Sheriff calls a posse and, led by Tom, they ride to the old adobe ruin that has been the robber's rendezvous. Slippery's wife is tired of the life of crime and she pleads with him to go to Mexico and live straight. They have just decided to do so, when looking up they see the posse approaching. Taking up their spoils, they ride away, hotly pursued by the posse. Slippery is shot in the arm, but they manage to elude their pursuers in the dense thicket, and the posse search for them vainly, and then returns to town. Tom Haley knows that his partner must be in one of the hiding places, frequently used by them when hard pressed, and continues his search alone. He comes upon Slippery in a secluded dell, his wife having gone for water to cleanse his wound. He forces the wounded man to mount, and takes him to the Sheriff. Slippery is placed in jail, and Tom becomes the town hero. Aside from the reward offered, the boys take up a collection for the treacherous partner. When Slippery's wife returns to the hiding place, she finds her husband gone and, knowing that he must be captured, turns her horse toward town to attempt his rescue.
