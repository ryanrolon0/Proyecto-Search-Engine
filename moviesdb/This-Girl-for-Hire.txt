This Girl for Hire

 In this pilot for a proposed TV series, B.T. Brady is a flippant, but somewhat klutzy female private detective in 1940s Hollywood who sets out to solve the murder of a obnoxious mystery writer. Along the way, Brady gets help from her flamboyant mother Zandra, a washed-up actress, as well as Brady's live-in boyfriend Wolfe who runs a memorabilia shop.
