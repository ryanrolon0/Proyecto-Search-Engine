Taxi til Båtsfjord

 The passenger in the taxi has ordered a long ride. He is big and has a rowdy behavior. He is not sober and acts like he owns the car. The driver is reduced to a frightened, humiliated and powerless "auto pilot", abandoned the situation. But he has limits.... The film describes a classical struggle between an intruder having paid for the service, and a friendly, unsuspecting and good person. Because of the passengers provoking and disrespectful attitude, the driver transforms, leaving both of them with a big surprise.
