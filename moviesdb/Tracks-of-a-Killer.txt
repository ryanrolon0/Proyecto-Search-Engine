Tracks of a Killer

 A couple and their guests spend quality time at an isolated chalet. When one of the guests dies, the other becomes really upset. He spends most of the movie torturing the hostess while sending the host off in the snow to die. In an effort to insure that his company is left in competent hands, an executive arranges physical and psychological test for a hand picked associate to assend to the top of his company upon his retirement. The two associates set off on a weeklong trip to the snowy mountains to be alone with their wives.
