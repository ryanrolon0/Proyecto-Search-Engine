Renegades of the Sage

 Following the Civil War, the U.S. government sets out to find a gang opposing the construction of telegraph lines in the west. They suspect Braden, who had formed a guerrilla band and destroyed the telegraph service during the war. Government agent Steve Duncan, who also works undercover as The Durango Kid, starts to run down the gang with only a picture of Braden for a clue. Steve is ambushed by an outlaw and left for dead but is rescued by Smiley, who takes him to a trading post ran by a man named Miller. Steve recognizes Miller as Braden, who tells him he is being falsely accused of crimes actually committed by Sloper.
