Sherlock Sleuth

 Arthur Stone, all but forgotten today, stars as Cyril Fromage, the house detective of the Hotel Omigosh. The lovely Martha Sleeper (Pass The Gravy) is his sweetheart, the hotel switchboard operator with Noah Young on board as the house manager. It seems a dastardly thief, "The Weasel" is on the loose in the hotel, assisted by a sultry vamp. The action that follows, and there is plenty of it, concerns Cyril's efforts to catch the thief. Plenty of hilarious gags along the way; a favorite involved Miss Sleeper taking a call from an irate lodger, so hot that it makes the switchboard steam. Taking advantage of the situation, she pulls out the offending plug and uses it to curl her bangs. The MGM lion even puts in a guest appearance.
