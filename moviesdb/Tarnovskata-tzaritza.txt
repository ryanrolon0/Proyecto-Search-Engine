Tarnovskata tzaritza

 The action takes place at the beginning of the 20th century in the provincial Bulgarian town, Turnovo. A rich young doctor suffers because of his love to his housemaid. Meanwhile the First World War is beginning... A young student, who has graduated as a doctor from a foreign university, comes back to Bulgaria, to Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgarian town, in early 20th century. His parents want him to marry a rich, but sickly young woman. He, instead, falls in love with beautiful maid Marina. Their happiness does not last long, as the doctor yields to his parents' demands. Abandoned, but proud, Marina finds a worthy path in life - she dedicates her time to the sick and wounded.
