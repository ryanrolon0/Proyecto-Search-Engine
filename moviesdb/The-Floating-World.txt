The Floating World

 When she is ten years old Ichiume is sold to a geisha house by her widowed mother. Six years later her geisha mistress forces her to go through the ceremony of Mizuage; her virginity will be sold to the highest bidder. Ichiume runs away rather then be forced to be with a stranger. Only when she returns to her childhood home it is abandoned. Ichiume decides to go back to the geisha house. It is the decision that makes her a woman and a geisha. Sold to a geisha house at the age of ten by her widowed mother, Ichiume is now about to go through Mizuage. Her virginity will be sold the the highest bidder. Now Ichiume must decide between running away and a life on the streets or to go through it and become a Geisha.
