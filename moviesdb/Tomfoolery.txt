Tomfoolery

 As a young woman struggles with her unrewarding job and the unsolicited advice of her party girl best friend, she finds herself dating three totally different guys, all named Tom. The rich broker is Tommy, the ex-jock mechanic is Thomas, and the oceanic PHD student is Tom. The fun turns to anxiety when a choice needs to be made.
