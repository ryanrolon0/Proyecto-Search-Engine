Un aller simple

 I am a civil servant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My boss, Loupiac, is having an affair with my wife. I can't take it any longer. I accepted this mission to escape the situation. 'Humanitarian AttachE' take a young clandestine back to his country. He belongs to the tribe of the Grey Men of Irguiz, secluded since prehistoric times in a secret city of the Great Atlas. The kid is amazing. I suspect that his identity papers are fake, that he probably made up this legend. But to believe him is the best way to return him to his home, and it makes me feel good. The power of a legend is unbelievable, once you've decided to believe in it... Being with the kid makes me rediscover life, revive my dreams. And ValErie, the guide he talked me into employing, is about to become the biggest love of my life. Real life now begins...
