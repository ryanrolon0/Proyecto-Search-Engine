Spero

 A psychological drama about one woman's painful experience of survival set within the frenzied paranoid anti-Communist world of the 1950s. The story excavates the dangers of political and militry intrusion into the medical world in search of the ultimate `mind-control' method; the result of which we see in torture techniques utilized in the 'War on Terror' today.
