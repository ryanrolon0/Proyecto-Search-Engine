Serial

 Who is Trenton Bracks? Well, What's there to say? Loyal and honest, he's a credit to southern gentlemen. Pleasant, carefree, and highly refined. He's got what it takes to be a model citizen. He's got looks and charm, a real lady-killer. Trenton seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and one in his hands, and one in the basement.
