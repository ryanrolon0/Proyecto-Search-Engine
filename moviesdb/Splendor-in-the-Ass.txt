Splendor in the Ass

 Ben Archer interviews Breck Stewart for a job as a photographer and it so happens that he is perfect for the "assignment" Ben had in mind. Ecstatic by this new turn of events, Breck dashes home to Robert Black where they soon consummate their deep desire for each other. All the while, a slew of men have their way with each other, their "behind" attributes being the main focus of this sensual flick.
