Vesuvius Express

 The first travelogue released by Twentieth Century-Fox in CineamaScope, produced and directed by Otto Lang, is a photographic record of a journey from Milan to Naples, through Florence and Rome, on a streamlined passenger train. En route, the film takes time out in the cities mentioned to take a look at the landmarks---past and present---with the climax on the edge of Vesuvius' smoldering crater.
