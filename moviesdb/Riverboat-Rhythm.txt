Riverboat Rhythm

 Matt Lindsay (Leon Errol) is the captain/owner of a showboat that is on the rocks literally and figuratively. His efforts to raise money to save his boat and troopers get him involved with a Kentucky Colonel (not named Sanders), a tough-as-a-boot hotel manager and a feuding family.
