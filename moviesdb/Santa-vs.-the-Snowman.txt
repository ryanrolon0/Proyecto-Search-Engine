Santa vs. the Snowman

 A lonely snowman finds Santa's workshop. But when he sets off the perimeter alarms and is chased away, he wonders why he couldn't be Santa and get all the love and fun this year. With the aid of "Snow Minions Made Easy", he pits his snow army against Santa's elves and captures Santa. But can he really do Santa's job?
