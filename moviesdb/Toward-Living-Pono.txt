Toward Living Pono

 'Toward Living Pono' follows internationally acclaimed film actor Jason Scott Lee and other residents of the Big Island of Hawai'i as they espouse the native hawaiian concept of 'Pono'--living righteously--by placing an emphasis in their lives upon the importance of respect for the environment, the wisdom of the ancestors, and one another. Their efforts in response to the grossly under-reported environmental and social justice crises in Hawai'i provide a model for all of us as we face global climate and culture catastrophes looming ahead.
