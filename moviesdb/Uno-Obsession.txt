Uno Obsession

 Charlotte and Robbie, both employees of the same company, have always played Uno at lunch time. It usually gets heated and all the other employees make a point of dropping whatever they're doing to watch the action. But one day Robbie is caught playing UNO with another girl. Charlotte, already hot-headed, completely loses it. The game of UNO takes on a whole new meaning when a long term relationship (as well as a left big toe) are on the line.
