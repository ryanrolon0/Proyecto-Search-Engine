The Bourne Stupidity

 On her fifth wedding anniversary Victoria Ritter is hit in the head by a rogue champagne cork. She falls into a coma. When she awakens she is Jasona Bourne, or is she? With amnesia and a pursuit to find out who she is, she goes on killing spree where not even the neighborhood children are safe. Jasona will stop at nothing to find out the truth; who is Monica, what is Bread Zone and why is her husband such a dork?
