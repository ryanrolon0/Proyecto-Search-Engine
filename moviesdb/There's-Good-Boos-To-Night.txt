There's Good Boos To-Night

 Poor lonely Casper the friendly ghost keeps scaring away prospective friends. Then a little fox cub who doesn't know better befriends him, and all is fine until a hunter comes along... It's nighttime, which means it's scare-time for all the ghosts in the graveyard. All but one. Casper wants nothing more than to have friends. But even without trying, he does nothing but frighten everyone. A cow jumps over the moon to avoid him; a skunk sprays him to drive him off. Poor Casper washes himself in a nearby tub and wrings himself dry, only to wet himself again with his tears. But a fox cub approaches and nuzzles himself against the lonely ghost. Casper is amazed, then overjoyed, to find that the fox isn't frightened of him. Casper names him Ferdie and the two quickly become best friends. But that friendship is threatened when a fox hunter and his two hounds come on the scene.
