Too Many Thieves

 When some priceless Macedonian treasures are swiped, lawyer Falk arrives to get to the bottom of things. He spends a good deal of time dodging more bad guys than in the average film, but that is because this is just two episodes of his "Trials of O'Brien" television show edited together and dumped quickly into the theaters. Plenty of dead bodies pile up along the way, with little excitement en route.
