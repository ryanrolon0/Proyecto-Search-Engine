The Excursion

 The excursion - a film straight through Berlin. This is the invitation for an excursion with underground, suburban train and airplane through the real and virtual Berlin and its adjacent surroundings. The viewer should be taught movement and it should also be made aware of the time factor. The audience will experience the pulse of the metropolis. However, a real world connects and melts together with the virtual world which a PC user can experience with corresponding software on his/her PC. Enjoy the journey.
