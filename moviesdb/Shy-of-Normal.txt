Shy of Normal

 When author Vinnie Judith Rosenberg loses her inspiration to write, her friend Jamie suggests going into public venues and observing random people. Vinnie takes the recommendation and, inspired by brief encounters with strangers, she creates three humorous shorts couples from very different class levels sharing a maternity room; "What's Included?" spies on three older-than-they-should-be college girls debating whether or not they should room together; and "Peter Kills Himself," following a suicidal man whose attempts to end it all are thwarted by random phone calls, pesky neighbors and the new girl upstairs who was just looking to borrow some sugar.
