The Psycho Legacy

 This documentary is a collection of interviews with various producers, actors and directors connected with the Psycho franchise. All give appropriate credit to the original _Psycho (1960)_ (qv) for setting the stage of modern slasher films, with only limited information on other aspects of film's originality. Most of the documentary is spent discussing the three subsequent sequels, which produced diminishing returns with respect to quality.
