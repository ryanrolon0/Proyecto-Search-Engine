The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice

 Othello, a Moorish general in the service of the Venetian state, is disdained for his race but valued for his military skills. He weds Desdemona in a mixed-race marriage that offends her father. Jealous of Othello's triumphs and high-standing, and suspicious that his commander may once have bedded his own wife, Othello's lieutenant Iago plots to sabotage Othello's career and marriage. He plants in Othello's mind the suspicion that Desdemona is unfaithful and provides false evidence of that infidelity. Though noble and initially trusting, Othello is led into a jealous rage that proves tragic for all involved.
