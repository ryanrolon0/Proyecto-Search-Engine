The Pygmy Hunt

 The Captain runs a safari business. He sets off to catch a live pygmy, with help from a tracking dog, but the dog isn't the world's most efficient, distracted first by some flowers, then when he actually encounters a pygmy, by the bone in his hair. Ultimately, he buries the pygmy; the Captain comes chasing along. With this crew, the pygmy's in no danger. Eventually, the pygmy swaps clothes with the Inspector; he runs off and grabs his whole tribe, and the safari crew takes off.
