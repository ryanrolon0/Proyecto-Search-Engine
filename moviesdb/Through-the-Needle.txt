Through the Needle

 A man in a bow tie, vest, and jacket checks into the Pioneer Motel, a seedy place in a small Midwestern town. He unpacks a phonograph and a vinyl album of Rachmaninoff. After a quick cellphone call, there's a knock at the door; it's a 14-year old girl. They've met on the Internet. She sits on the bed. They talk a bit about themselves -- his prison term, her uncaring parents. Then, it's time.
