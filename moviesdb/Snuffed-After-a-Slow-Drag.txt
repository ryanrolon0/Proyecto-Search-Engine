Snuffed After a Slow Drag

 Perot carries on a silent relationship with a girl he sees every day on a pier in Brooklyn. It seems to be enough for them, until Perot's well-intentioned roommate Arnet tries to intervene, and they have to decide whether their fragile arrangement can survive a shift in dynamic. Jesse Miksic directs a fleeting romance, accompanied by images of stasis and renewal, set to a jazz theme, and entirely carried out on a pier in Brooklyn.
