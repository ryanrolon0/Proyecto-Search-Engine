The Feudalists

 Buck Hutson, a sharecropper who acts as the enforcer of order on Mr. Buchanan's properties, is sent to evict a methamphetamine producing tenant named Willy. Unfortunately, diplomatic Buck is forced to bring along the trigger happy Redd, causing a violent skirmish to break out at Willy's house. As Buck struggles to restrain Redd and assist those in danger, he discovers the seedy underbelly of Mr. Buchanan's system that Buck so wholeheartedly protects.
