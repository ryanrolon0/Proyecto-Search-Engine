Virtual Clay, Electric Glass

 VIRTUAL CLAY, ELECTRIC GLASS is the story of the Virtual Studio Project, an experiment using videoconferencing technology between four nationally and internationally known clay and glass artists in three U.S. states (Alabama, Louisiana, and New York). Normally, artists have to be in the same studio to work together. We wanted to see if the Crucible Project artists could create real art in a Virtual Studio. On March 10, 2010 the artists worked in the comfort of their own studios and were able to see and hear one another through portable videoconferencing systems. The end result would be the creation of separate, mutually-inspired pieces in an electronic creative space bounded only by the limits of their imaginations.
