The Other Side of the Door

 This film engages two LDS Missionaries in their day-to-day task of going door to door trying to share their faith with others. The content explores what it feels like to be constantly rejected by unwilling home owners and how the two are able to find strength to keep going. The approach is one of neutrality and observance as it presents the ideas and feelings of the Missionaries without taking a stance for or against their beliefs. In this way, the work acts as a entertaining and enlightening way to show what it truly is like on the other side of the door.
