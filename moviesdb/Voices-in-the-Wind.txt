Voices in the Wind

 Voices in the Wind documents New Yorkers reactions to the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001 for one year following the event. Armed with only her camera and her voice, the film maker brings to the audience her personal experience interviewing friends who were in the towers during the attacks, prominent New Yorkers and random pedestrians -- creating a kaleidoscope of images and voices which reflect the atmosphere of a crippled yet defiant city in the early days and weeks after the World Trade Center bombing. Peace rallies emerge as well as New Yorkers discussing the uncertainties after such horrendous acts of terror. The film strives to remain objective as dozens of New Yorkers express a spectrum of differing views on life in America after 9/11.
