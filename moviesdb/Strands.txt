Strands

 Animated fingerprints interact with dancers in this live action / animated dance film about desire, consciousness and identity. Set amongst subtle, evocative shadows, the dancers reveal the underlying themes of death, rebirth and the act of having one's identity become unraveled only to find it renewed in unexpected places.
