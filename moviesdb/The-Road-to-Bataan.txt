The Road to Bataan

 Every year, they come by the thousands. Soldiers, sailors, civilians and students. Veterans of wars gone by and guests from foreign shores. They come to march. They come to sacrifice. They come to honor and pay their respects to the greatest generation of our time. The Bataan Memorial Death March is 26.2 miles through the unforgiving high desert terrain of New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range. And yet, it's more than a marathon. It's more than a road march. It's a reminder for future generations to never forget what's been lost, a model example of our core values, and a testament to the human spirit.
