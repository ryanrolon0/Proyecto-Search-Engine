Shanghai jiaqi

 A 12-year-old American-born Chinese boy from America experiences the clash of cultures and the inevitable generation gap when he visits his grandfather in Shanghai. He runs away from the old man's home and loses his way in the countryside. His grandfather too has the dilemma of being unable to forget his first love, whose look-alike daughter is now his best friend.
