The Sweep

 When two bumbling janitors (Hardison and Godfrey) stumble across a briefcase full of cash, it's game on. Or so they think. After immediately blowing all the cash on cars and clothes, they discover that the money belonged to the mob, and the mob isn't happy. An ultimatum is laid down and the two janitors have a week to pay the money back, or else it'll be their knee caps.
