The Oh-Malleys in Daddy's My Mercedes

 Meet Momma Kim O'Malley (June Lu) an unfiltered, sharp tonged Korean grandmother, who drinks her way through her newly adopted grandson's one year birthday celebration. But her son Charles O'Malley (Tim Lounibos), his partner Aaron Gotti (Tony Tripoli), her daughter Kasey O'Malley (Erin Quill), and her son-in-law Tim Quill (Matt Moline) tries to make sure that the special Korean event stays that way. But Auntie Esther (Jodi Long), Momma Kim's younger sister, has other ideas. Will the good natured kids prevail, or will long standing sibling rivalry dampen this special day? Either way, welcome to the Oh-Malleys.
