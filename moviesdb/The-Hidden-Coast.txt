The Hidden Coast

 The Hidden Coast is a visual journey through the spectacular Naples coastline North of Santa Barbara, CA. Two experts are interviewed as to why this is such a special section of our coast and what is at stake on land and in the offshore reef. Beautiful footage from land and sea is interspersed with an etheric, experimental soundtrack designed to complement the stunning images.
