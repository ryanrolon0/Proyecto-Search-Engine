Turk 182!

 Jimmy Lynch is angry because his older brother, who was injured as a result of an off duty fire rescue, is denied benefits by the city. At the same time, Mayor Tyler is embroiled in a political scandal that he denies all previous knowledge of. Jimmy begins painting "Tyler Knew, Turk 182" as an embarrassment to the mayor. The mayor is furious at this grafitti appearing all over the city and orders the police to find the artist. Jimmy's "Turk 182" spraypaints continue to appear.
