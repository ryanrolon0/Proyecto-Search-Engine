The Ghosts of Scotland

 "Scotland has more ghosts stories than I've had hot dinners", exclaims ghoulish narrator Adam Lyal (deceased). From the gothic ambiance of the Inner Sanctum Mr. Lyal regales, expounds & embroiders a selection of supernatural tales with his unique blend of charismatic wit and wisdom. With a keen historical eye, Adam answers many sinister questions chosen from the never-ending Scottish library of legends. His spine chilling stories are brought down to earth by the cynical comments of Scottish sceptic "Doubting Thomas" who casts doubt on Adam's tales of woe & intrigue. This mortifying mix of history, humour & hauntings provide us with an entertaining, amusing, yet fascinating film on phantoms.
