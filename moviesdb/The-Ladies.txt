The Ladies

 Before the Hungarian revolution Vali and Mimi had separate lives was a bohemian costume designer, the younger a pragmatic tomboy who drove a taxi. After nearly losing their lives in a Russian work camp the sisters escaped to the US and began rebuilding their lives as 40 year old women in a foreign land. Their circumstances forced them to embrace their differences and prioritize family over their singular aspirations. Nearing the end of their lives, two women are inseparable parts of a collective story, fiercely independent, tirelessly honest and burdened with the perspective of regret, their relationship encompasses an era and exemplifies the paramount importance of creativity in a world of perpetual change.
