The Ghost of the Castle

 Beyond the historical galleries, the Old State Capitol is now home to unforgettable magic via an immersive theater experience that engulfs guests in the history of the building. The Ghost of the Castle is a unique theatrical presentation featuring special effects that play out across every surface of this intimate gallery. The ghost is Sarah Morgan, an authentic Civil War-era figure who loved the castle from the day it was built and wrote passionately about it in her published Diary of a Confederate Girl. In the 12-minute show that makes every surface in the room come to life, Morgan conjures the building's remarkable trials and tribulations through history, and shows the determination of everyday Louisianians who have saved the castle time and time again.
