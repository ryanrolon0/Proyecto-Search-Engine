Quark and the Princess

 In the sixth of a series of cartoons featuring Quark, the ugly troll from _Valhalla (1986)_ (qv), Quark assists a prince in releasing a fair princess from the imprisonment of a giant green frog. When the prince turns out to be less than he made himself out to be, Quark is left alone with the task, but things turn out quite differently than expected.
