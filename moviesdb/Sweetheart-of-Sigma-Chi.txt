Sweetheart of Sigma Chi

 The always-welcome Elyse Knox and her All-American footballer turned broadcaster husband Tom Harmon appear together in this film but are not romantically involved, as she is the co-ed "sweetheart" of the title and he coaches the Varsity rowing crew. Some source describes Miss Knox as a B-actress. A more apt and better description would be one that describes her as an Actress who never got out of B-movies. This one is about half plot and half music but the plot is stretched pretty thin to cover 35 of the 75 minutes when it essentially boils down to pressure the local night club(soft drinks only)owner to rig things so the local college rowing crew will lose their upcoming race. End of plot when the cowswain of the home team uses a rabbit's foot to plug the hole the gamblers cut in the bottom of their racing shell. Two of 1945's top hits, "Five Minutes More" and Slim Gaillard's "Cement Mixer, Putti-Putti" are performed, although some people who heard "Cement Mixer" in 1945 are still wondering what it was all about.
