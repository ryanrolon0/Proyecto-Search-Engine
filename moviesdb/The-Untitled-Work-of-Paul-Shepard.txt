The Untitled Work of Paul Shepard

 When he receives a phone call from an ex-girlfriend about a book of poetry she's releasing, frustrated filmmaker Paul Shepard finally has the hook for his new documentary-an examination of modern relationships. But when it turns out that the book is less about love in general and more about him-and his numerous failings-in particular, Paul shifts the focus of his doc inwards, tracking down his exes to find out what went wrong.
