The Dancing Llama

 A world-renowned tap-dancing llama named Davy develops a spitting disorder that ruins his reputation and self-esteem. To make things worse, a twirling starfish named Diego challenges his dancing supremacy at the annual dance competition. Through the help of a carrot therapist, a flan-obsessed Peruvian mystic, and the simple lessons of his number one fan, a young cat named Jesse, Davy goes on a journey to discover what it means to be a llama and what it means to be himself.
