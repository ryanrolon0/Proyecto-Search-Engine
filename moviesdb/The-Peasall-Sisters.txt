The Peasall Sisters

 Their life as a home schooling family of six children changed overnight when they recorded songs for the Grammy Award winning soundtrack for "O Brother Where Art Thou?". What remained constant, though, was their commitment to their faith and their family. THE PEASALL SISTERS - FAMILY HARMONY is a celebration of their beautiful music and their enduring focus on being a God-honoring family. FAMILY HARMONY includes an intimate live performance filmed at Pucketts in historic Franklin, Tennessee, as well as the documentary-style telling of the Peasall family story. The 45-minute program also includes bonus features.
