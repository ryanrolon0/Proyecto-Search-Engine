That's Not What Happened!

 Two story lines in this bondage video and a government agent tell completely different of their investigation into a crime kingpin's criminal activities, where their counterpart was captured, bound, gagged and in need of rescue. Both ladies are placed in bondage at the end of the segment. In the second story, a crusading journalist investigates a white slavery ring only to fall victim to the crooks herself and finds herself bound, gagged and prepared for the auction block.
