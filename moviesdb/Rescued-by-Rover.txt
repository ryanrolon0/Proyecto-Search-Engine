Rescued by Rover

 Rescued by Rover is a film about a dog. Not only is it a film about a dog it is also a film about the kidnaping of a young baby by an old woman. With these two classical Hollywood ingredients and some stunning dialogue, (It's silent!), Rescued by Rover really hits a nerve. The repeated shots provide some interest in what, surprisingly, is an entertaining example of early cinema, canine heroics and a man wearing mascara.
