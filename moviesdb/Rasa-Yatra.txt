Rasa Yatra

 Rasa Yatra depicts the beauty of pilgrimage in an imaginative way, whilst exploring the essence of devotion in Hindu culture through non-linear narrative. Rasa in Sanskrit language means 'taste' or 'juice', depending on a pronunciation it can also mean 'dance'. Yatra means 'journey', suggesting a joyful inner expedition beyond the confines of routine and conceptual conventions. Shot over a period of four years, Rasa Yatra takes the viewer on a meditative cinematic journey across the sacred places in the Himalayan mountains right into the spiritual heart of India, Vrindavan. For the receptive viewer it becomes a pilgrimage rather than a mere depiction of a pilgrimage in a global context.
