The Adventurous Blonde

 Angry that police detective Steve McBride is giving preferential treatment to his fiancEe, reporter Torchy Blane, reporters from a rival newspaper plan a fake murder with the idea that Torchy's paper will print the story and look foolish, teaching a lesson to Torchy and McBride. The tables are turned when the fake murder turns out to be the genuine article. Journalists from other newspapers try to keep Torchy Blane and her fiance Steve McBride apart on their wedding day with a faked murder, but the murder turns out to be a real one. To get even for repeated news-scoops by "Torchy" Blane, and fearing that her forthcoming marriage to Steve McBride---her detective-lieutenant fiancEe---will forever keep them from getting news tips from the police department, four reporters, Mat, Dud, Mugsy and Pete, arrange to frame a murder mystery for the dual purpose of blocking Steve's marriage to Torchy, and at the same time, making her the laughing stock of all newspaperdom. A fake broadcast comes to Steve and "Torchy" while driving to the minister in Steve's police car. The pair quickly go to the "scene of the crime" and Torchy immediately phones in her presumed scoop, and a newspaper extra edition, headlining the murder, is quickly on the streets. The opposition newspapers very quickly print a denial of "Torchy's" story. Then it is learned that the hoax-victim, Harvey Hammond, has actually been murdered, and several persons, including the four reporters, are suspects.
