Walk of Redemption

 A journey of a man, Mark Beckford, who lived the gang life doing harm, but had a chance to turn his life around. Set on a mission to right the wrongs he had done, he will endure hardships from the past, as well as new ones, but all for the sake of trying to fight for a better tomorrow. A compelling story of miraculous proportions. Take another look at island life in the Bahamas.
