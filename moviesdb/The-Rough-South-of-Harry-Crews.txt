The Rough South of Harry Crews

 Writer-director Gary Hawkins's first "Rough South" entry, "The Rough South of Harry Crews," bases his show on Crew's revealing remark, "What has been most significant in my life had all taken place by the time I was six years old." Hawkins re-enacts the early episodes of Crew's childhood through a still-photo technique reminiscent of Chris Marker's "La Jette," juxtaposing the stills against Crew's commentary to reveal the source of his adult literary themes.
