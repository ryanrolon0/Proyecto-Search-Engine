Symmetrical Balance A

 A man is two sided. Although one recognizes only one side and exposes it to the word though actions and inactions, there is a hidden side, which is forgotten. That side is beyond a reach of conscious movements whether mental or physical. Yet, its power force a man out of balance. This work explores one's endeavor to keep balance between two sides through secrecy, reticence, and amnesia. It is mute scream, visual whisper, disguised monologue, unheard dialogue, and loud silence that are physicalized and experimented.
