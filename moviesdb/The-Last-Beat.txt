The Last Beat

 "The Last Beat" follows the final days of Jay Douglas, famous American rock star, in a turbulent, but exhilarating early 70's Paris. Loosely based on the last days of rock and pop culture icon Jim Morrison, the film is not in any way a traditional biopic, but a lyrical study of a brilliant, complex, and troubled soul. Tragic and comedic, at the film's core are Jay's broken, but passionate relationships with the two women in his life -- Clemence, a glamorous French Countess, and his professed "soul-mate," Valerie Eason, an earthy red-haired beauty from golden California.
