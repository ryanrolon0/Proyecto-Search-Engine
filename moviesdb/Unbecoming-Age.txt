Unbecoming Age

 A middle-aged woman frees herself from the spirit-crushing influence of her husband by refusing to remember what her age is. Her husband works long hours as an advertising executive and neglects his family while asking her "what do you do all day long?" What she does is work hard keeping the family together. An intelligent family film. Julia (Diane Salinger) seems to be going through a big change of life at age forty. She makes several dramatic changes; her hair color and style, her laid back attitude becomes extroverted and she becomes very permissive. All because of the magic bubble and making a wish. Lets make everyone happy.
