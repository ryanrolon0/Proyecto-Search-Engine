The Dust Never Settles

 Composed of footage recorded during a fourteen month, 50,000 kilometer road tour of Australia with a soundtrack by Australian three piece The Dirty Three. Placing fascinating and humorous encounters with the unconventional individuals who inhabit some of the country's most remote areas against a wilderness of unimaginable magnitude the director transcends conventions of traditional documentary with her impartial approach and distinctive visual style. The Dust Never Settles is a rare document of the endlessly diverse landscape and culture of a continent, and a unique vision of contemporary Australia.
