Unbalanced Breakfast

 A young woman sits home alone one morning. She decides she wants a bowl of cereal, but discovers that she is out of milk. After considering putting syrup or ice cream on her cereal as a substitute, she then finds a can of condensed milk in a cabinet. But then she realizes that she needs a can opener to open the condensed milk, and a frantic search of her kitchen comes up fruitless. With no reasonable way to open the can, she reaches for a meat clever and resorts to drastic means to get to the milk she needs to enjoy her breakfast.
