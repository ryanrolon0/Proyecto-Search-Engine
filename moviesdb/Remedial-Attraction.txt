Remedial Attraction

 When Tara and Amy Wellword are forced to go to summer school, their plans before senior year take a dramatic turn. Going in with low expectations, they don't plan for their summer to be very exciting. Little do they know, hunky classmates Mike and Jim are also taking summer classes. What starts out as a lackluster summer soon becomes a three month beginning to unknown possibilities. Popular high school Juniors Tara Wellword and Amy Wellword have to take a remedial Algebra class in summer school before their Senior year, but it's not all bad... they're spending time with Mike Rallin and Jim Starter who are working up the courage to ask them out on a date. With a little support from a middle school genius, a prep-school sophisticate and three high school misfits, young love could triumph over summer school Algebra.
