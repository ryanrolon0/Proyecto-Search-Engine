Rice & Potatoes

 Rice Filmed in San Francisco, the documentary Rice & Potatoes presents a revealing look at the lives of 17 gay men, both Asian and Caucasian. The diverse cast offers frank and insightful commentary on the issues and stereotypes surrounding inter-racial gay relationships, talking candidly about the physical attraction, the differences in cultural upbringing, sexual roles, being out, family obligations, and the use of racial labels. Their stories, often funny, always thought provoking, offer an intimate portrait of men searching for love, coping with prejudice, and building relationships.
