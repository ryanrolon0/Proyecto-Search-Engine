The Hard Easy

 In Los Angeles, the gambler Paul Weston is a loser, and owes a lot of money to the dangerous mobster Freddie. When he is brutally beaten and the life of his former wife is threatened by the Freddie, his acquaintance bartender Vinnie sends him to Dr. Charlie Brooks first and then he convinces him to participate of a heist in the jewelry district with the professional thief Gene to raise the necessary money to pay his debt. Meanwhile, the stock market broker Roger Hargitay finds that the company where he works embezzled US$ 5,000,000.00 from their clients and he will be arrested in a couple of days. His boss Ed Koster convinces Roger and two co-workers to participate in an easy robbery of a jewelry planned by an inside man. On Saturday morning, both gangs arrive in the same jewelry for the same heist at the same time. Although Paul Weston and Roger Hargitay don't know each other, they have the same problem. They both owe a lot of money, have no conceivable way to pay it back and the clock is ticking. When each gets the opportunity to join a different gang of thieves for a heist that will clear their respective debts, what choice do they possibly have? The good thing is that - it will be an easy robbery - an inside job. Unfortunately, it turns out to be the same robbery, at the same time. Suddenly this used car salesman and this yuppie stock broker find themselves in a gun battle with each other and the police, leaving them no other choice but to team up in order to get away. The hard easy takes place in a dark world where nothing is as it seems and only the lucky survive.
