The Contemptuous Ruby

 A dark and conflicted erotic neo-noir short feature, The Contemptuous Ruby takes a tried and true concept of treachery and sexual debauchery and spins it into a well-defined psycho thriller with a classic story line. The dark and steamy late night location of The French Quarter makes the script feel all that more intimate and personal.
