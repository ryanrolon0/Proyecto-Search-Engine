The Hidden

 An alien is on the run in America. To get his kicks, it kills anything that gets in its way, and uses the body as a new hiding place. This alien has a goal in life; power. Hotly pursued by another alien (who's borrowed the body of a dead FBI agent), lots of innocent people die in the chase. When the ordinary citizen Jack DeVries (Chris Mulkey) heists many banks and kills many people, the whole police department chases him under the command of detective Tom Beck (Michael Nouri). They capture him and seriously wounded, he is sent to the hospital, sharing a room with Jonathan Miller (William Boyett), a man with serious gastritis. The FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan) comes to the police station looking for DeVries and is assigned to join Tom. When they arrive in the hospital, DeVries is dead and Jonathan is missing. This is the beginning of the hunting for a mysterious and bloody alien. The police are hunting a man, who has committed several crimes, mostly auto theft. They eventually captured but not after a long chase and only after he crashes his car and is burned. At the hospital, the man rises and then proceeds to the man in the room with him. He then proceeds to open the man's mouth and a creature comes out of his and enters the man. The man then stands up and walks out of the hospital. An FBI agent goes to the police and says he is looking for the man they just caught. When he goes to the hospital, he takes a photo of the man and gives it to the police and says that they have to find him. After a long chase, the detective, who is frustrated, arrests the FBI agent and demands to know what is going on. He says that he is an alien and that the people they have been pursuing have each been taken over by an alien that he is pursuing.
