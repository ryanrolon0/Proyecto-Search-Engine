The Bulls of Suburbia

 Bulls tells the story of one suburbanite's journey to learn the skills of the matador within the secretive world of bullfighting in Mexico and Spain. The film follows the young trainee through familiar and foreign lands as he learns the precision, discipline, and grace of the bull fight, and in a final, single confrontation with the bull, we see that the search for victory in the ring has been a quest for something much greater.
