Slow Traffic Keep Right

 A small time hood, Eddie, gets an opportunity to prove himself to the local crime lord by killing a troublesome night club owner. But after the hit goes down, the crime lord's enforcer tries to cheat Eddie out of his share of the money. In the ensuing struggle the enforcer is killed, leaving Eddie to confront the crime boss on his own in order to collect on the original deal and prove that his loyalty is still intact.
