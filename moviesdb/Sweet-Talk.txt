Sweet Talk

 A modern phone sex and Internet love story. A frustrated sculptor artist calls a phone sex service on a dare and meets the love of his life. These lovers develop an obsessive relationship over the phone. They each create erotic period fantasies in each others imagination over the phone, then through the Internet, which in turn makes the fantasies come to life in a real world encounter.
