Voices of War

 Oral history is a time-honored tradition...a means of passing knowledge and life experience from one generation to the next. In an effort to memorialize these inherently valuable first-person historical records, Nenagh Films launched "Voices of War educational series will feature the stories of the men and women who have served in this country's great conflicts from World War II to present-day Iraq. Once filmed, these interviews will be condensed into mini-documentaries and lesson plans that will be available to schools and libraries nationwide, where they will become part of this nation's permanent historical record. History books can only tell us so much. The personal tales of the men and women who lived through these world-shaping events speak volumes.
