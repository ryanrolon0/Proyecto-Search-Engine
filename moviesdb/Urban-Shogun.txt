Urban Shogun

 In a decrepit metropolis, an evil plot is brewing. A new animated shogun has come into power by slaying all of his opponents. Only one threat remains to the evil shogun's power- his old sensei, Mitsurugi. To dispose of his former teacher, the new shogun sends his most skilled assassin, Tatsumi, a live-action, bad-ass assassin from the 70's with an even more bad-ass handlebar mustache. Meanwhile, in a parking garage across town, Mitsurugi (who looks like he was cut out of an old Kurosawa film) trains with his new student, a timid, small, poorly-drawn animated character, whose name can-not be mentioned due to licensing law-suit brought about by DC Comics (apparently the character too closely resembled a character created by Bob Kane). Tatsumi arrives with pistol loaded. A epic dual ensues between the old sensei and the assassin, resulting in the Mitsurugi's death. The new student witnesses all of this, frozen in shock as his teacher is brutally slain in front of him. He now must face his fears, and avenge his master's death.
