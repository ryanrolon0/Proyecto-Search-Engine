The Emerald Forest

 Based on a true story, Powers Boothe plays an American dam engineer in Brazil. Boothe's son (played by Charlie Boorman - son of director John Boorman) is kidnapped by a rain forest tribe, and raised as one of their own. Boothe continues to look for him and after many trials and adventures, stumbles upon him. An American businessman searches the Amazon rainforest for the Indian tribe that he believes has kidnapped his son and begins to understand the damage that a dam project is exacting on the forest and on its people. Tommy Markham, the young son of American engineer working on a dam project on the edge of the Brazilian Rain Forest, is abducted and adopted by a primitive tribe. The father, Bill Markham, spends the next ten years searching in vain for the kidnapped boy. Ultimately Markham is captured by a cannibal tribe and ironically rescued by "Tomme," who only has dim memories of his biological father. Although Bill wants desperately to have his son accompany him back to civilization, "Tomme's" loyalties now belong to "The Invisible People."
