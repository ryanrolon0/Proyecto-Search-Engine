SexualidadeS

 Documentary about sex, based on a psychoanalytic theory called "NOVAmente", developed in Rio de Janeiro since the 1980s, inspired by the works of thinker MD Magno. The theory considers human sexuality to be completely open to experience, without fixed parameters and totally dissociated from human reproduction.
