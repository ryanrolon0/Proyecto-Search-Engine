Understanding Your Ideals

 Teenaged Jeff stupidly thinks that the road to popularity is a fast car and nice clothes. However, his girlfriend and his dad soon show him the error of his ways by proving--via such examples as The Ten Commandments and the intricacies of hydroelectric dam construction, subjects of vital interest to teenagers in the 1950s--that sound ideals, of course, are the basis of popularity. Jeff learns a valuable lesson that will serve him well later in life suits--drive a Studebaker and become a born-again construction engineer.
