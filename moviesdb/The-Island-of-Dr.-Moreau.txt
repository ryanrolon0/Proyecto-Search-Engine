The Island of Dr. Moreau

 This remake of the 1977 film stars Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer, and Dragonheart's David Thewlis. Set in the year 2010, Dr. Moreau (Brando) has successfully combined human and animal DNA to make a crossbreed animal. Well, as usual, something goes wrong and David Thewlis must try to stop it before it is too late. Originally rated R, but cut by Frankenheimer to allow "a wider audience".
