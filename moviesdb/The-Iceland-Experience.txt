The Iceland Experience

 Shot mostly in Reykjavik, Iceland, The Iceland Experience features up and coming artists that have taken the unique landscape of their native land, and transformed it into cutting edge music. Ampop, The Funerals, and Apparat Organ Quartet follow in the footsteps of Bjork and Sigur Ros, by challenging the perceptions of mainstream music.
