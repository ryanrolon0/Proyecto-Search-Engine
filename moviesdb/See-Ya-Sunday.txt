See Ya Sunday

 The story of the Little Rock Kickball Association (LRKA). This documentary chronicles the rise of the Atomic Catsicles (a first-year team looking to make its mark on the league) while at the same time taking you inside the LRKA. Founder Larry Betz describes his creation of the LRKA, the league's purpose, the game in detail, and what kickball means to the community and its members. You'll experience an entire season of kickball - from the first team meeting through the quest for the 'Poo's Cup' - the crowning of the ultimate kings of the kickball universe.
