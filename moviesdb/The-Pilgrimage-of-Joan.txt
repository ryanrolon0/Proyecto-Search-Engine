The Pilgrimage of Joan

 A synaesthetic exploration of two spirited French women through the medium of film. The images are an evocation of Joan of Arc, circling the island of St. Michael's Mount in pilgrimage, while the sound belongs to Edith Piaf, whose voice rings through the disorder of the soundtrack.
