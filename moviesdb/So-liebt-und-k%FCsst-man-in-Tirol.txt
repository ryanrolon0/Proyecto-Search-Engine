So liebt und küsst man in Tirol

 In a Tyrol resort town, the mayor plots with his debtor-employee to put his inn's competitor Thesi Gruber out of business and/or persuade her to sell him a mountain plot, which will become priceless when a sanatorium will be built. His son, an engineer and Thesi's former flame, is still romantically interested. The hotel guests they fight for have their own interests and concerns.
