The Tony Hancock Special

 Hancock, (who was voted Britain's best ever comic 35 years after his death) leaves his home in Railway Cuttings, East Cheam, England for warmer, more challenging climes. He encounters the Australian natives on his terms having dragged his attitudes with him half way across the world.
