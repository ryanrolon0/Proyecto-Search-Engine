Spirits in the Kitchen

 "A policeman is seen visiting in the kitchen with Bridget. While the two are drinking a social glass of beer, a tramp suddenly appears as if coming through the roof. The policeman starts after him, but the tramp disappears; and in his place there is a stove. The tramp at the same time mysteriously finds his way under the table. Bridget gives the policeman some sausages to eat, but they change into a live cat. The cat runs away, and the policeman starts to sit down on a chair; as he does so, it changes to a tub of water and he gets a bath. He then sees the tramp under the table, and thinking him responsible for all the trouble, starts after him. The tramp jumps into the air and disappears. The policeman jumps after him and also vanishes, and Bridget faints in amazement."
