Sunshine Dad

 A band of mystics, searching for the sacred jewels stolen from the shrine of their idol, looses a lion from its cage, hoping it will devour the girl they believe to possess the jewels. But when a wacky old actor inadvertently takes the girl out of harm's way, the lion and the mystics set forth in pursuit.
