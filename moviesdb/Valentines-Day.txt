Valentines Day

 'Valentines Day', usually a romantic day for some. But in this case a broken thief tries her luck at one last robbery without her usual accomplice/love of her life and fails at her attempt to steal a man's car as she bursts into tears! The man she attempts to rob has no idea what to do in this unlikely situation but show empathy towards the thief by describing his situation with his girlfriend who cares more about her car then she does him. These comments are made throughout the film which aggravate the thief even more. The thief spills the beans in regards to her failed love life (With a dramatic fast paced flashback scene all is revealed) and the man tries to comfort her through out the film by giving her some helpful advice which in turn she is grateful for. He also offers the car to the thief freely in which the thief replies 'I was going to take the car anyway'. The film ends with a comedic note as the man is walking away, pondering how he will break the news to his girlfriend.
