Stormhouse

 In 2002, eight months before the invasion of Iraq, the Military captured and imprisoned a supernatural entity at Stormhouse, a secret underground base. This film documents the final four days of that experiment. 'Ghost whisperer' Hayley Sands is brought to Stormhouse by the Government to make contact with the captured entity. But her arrival triggers a series of events which lead to the entity's escape, plunging the base into a horrific nightmare. Delivering everything from heart-pounding tension to nerve-shredding shocks and jumps, Stormhouse combines the realism of Paranormal Activity with the chilling atmosphere of The Ring and the visceral horror of the Saw movies. The disturbing climactic twists will leave audiences stunned.
