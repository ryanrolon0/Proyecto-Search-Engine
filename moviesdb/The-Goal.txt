The Goal

 "The Goal" chronicles the lives of two athletes who are on an adrenaline track, one to the Olympics and the other to the world of Pro Soccer. Steve and Jason cross paths while rebuilding their lives following severe accidents. Tragedy affects everyone, not just the injured. Much like an epicenter of an earthquake, it touches many but everyone reacts differently. "Life is a Journey Within" but they have "The Goal, One Dream, One Mission, Bending Steel to Make It Happen"!
