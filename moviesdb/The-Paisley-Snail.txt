The Paisley Snail

 It tells the story of the common law world's most famous case and the modern law of negligence which it established. The program mixes humour, dramatic recreation, archival footage and interviews as it traces May Donoghue's journey from the Wellmeadow Cafe in 1928 to the House of Lords and Lord Atkin's famous decision in 1932.
