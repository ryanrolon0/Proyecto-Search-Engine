Surrender

 Bess Roundtree is addicted to crack cocaine. She is a new young mother and cannot seem to handle the task. She calls a friend of hers for a cab ride to an old church that she attended as a little girl. The cab driver is both annoyed and disgusted to have to do her this favor. Once she arrives at the church, she runs into her old deacon, whom she convinces to pray for her. A prayer for her to come back some day. The unsuspecting deacon enters into his office, which is when Bess places the young baby on the church steps. And just walks away. On the cab ride back, she argues and fights with Aaron, the cabdriver, who we discover has a special relationship with Bess. Things unfold to an interesting finale when Bess confronts her demons.
