Walk Away and I Stumble

 Andy Spader has been happily married for 13 years, with two teenage children, when he meets a younger woman, Claire Holmes, after going to investigate a break-in at her travel agency shop. Having told his wife that he is leaving her, he learns that Claire has just discovered that she has an inoperable brain tumour and has only a few months to live.
