The Milkmaid

 Satisfying the Lactation Nation two jugs at a time! This is a gritty 70's exploitation flick for sure. A lonely woman narrates this story about a most memorable day in her life. It starts out as a neighbor, Debra, whose husband is away, comes to visit the bored housewife. Tantalizing Debra seduces the housewife in an erotic scene of lust and passion. Shortly afterward, Sandy & her boyfriend Rick unveil a terrible dilemma. It seems that he just can't become aroused and admits that he craves a little lactation action - which fuels the Milk Maid's passions.
