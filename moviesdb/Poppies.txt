Poppies

 Bill is one of many volunteers to help raise donations for the poppy appeal. Underneath his proud silent stance Bill is a broken man, the consequence of his traumatic history. Memories and emotions left in the wake of war still haunt him to this day. Those who bare the scars of war are often forgotten, but the sacrifices and burdens they carry have allowed many to live a life of normality.
