Simon Sezz

 Simon was born unto this world a "tabula rasa." His slate has been filled by the great corporate committee. For 35 years, Simon has known an ignorant bliss. Now deep within Simon something is stirring - a universal consciousness, causing angst, chaos, a gnashing of teeth in the classic clash of the titans be good and great, but where is the love? Simon's musings are as such "transcendental" whereby love is the "great elevator" ready to "fax" Simon beyond an otherwise dismal existence.
