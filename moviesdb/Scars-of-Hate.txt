Scars of Hate

 An Arizona rancher on a trip to New York falls in love with and marries a wealthy New York society girl, and takes her back to his ranch. She doesn't take to the "pioneer" life at all, however, and a misunderstanding causes him to leave her and become a Ranger. He eventually discovers the real truth about what happened, and hopes it's not too late save his marriage.
