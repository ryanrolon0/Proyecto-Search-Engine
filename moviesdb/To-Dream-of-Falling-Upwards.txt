To Dream of Falling Upwards

 The elder Magus of the Thelemic Temple of Horus just passed away. Jack Mason , a promising young sex magickian cultivated to advance the lineage, loses it all when the elder Magus' biological son unexpectedly inherits everything with plans to commercialize and franchise the Temple. Jack plots deadly revenge and falls into a dizzying maze of encounters with underworld characters, desert brujas, and a twist of fate he never saw coming or...did he?
