Tar Sand Pudding

 In a hilarious send-up of a cooking show, three kids take on Alberta's oil sands and create a holy mess of their own, complete with oil-drowned ducks. And a pink bunny. With the maniacal logic of pre-schoolers, Maezy, Medina, and Zaiyah satirize Syncrude's environmental stewardship of the tar sands that resulted in a dead duck disaster.
