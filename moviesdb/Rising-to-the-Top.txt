Rising to the Top

 The Sarakasi Trust is a non-profit organization founded by Marion and Rudy Van Dijck in Nairobi, Kenya. It aims to improve the lives of impoverished people through arts and culture by supporting local dancers and acrobats. "Rising to the Top" tells the story of two of the many artists that have advanced their lives by being a part of this organization.
