The Agony & The Ecstacy

 In a past life, not so long ago, our friend and mentor and born-again Christian, Isaiah P. Goodewoode, was Flex Spiceshaft, a hard-living, boozing, and drug-addicted porn star, flushing down the proverbial crapper at warp speeds. Now, and forevermore, a devote disciple of the Lord, Isaiah would like to share with each and every one of you - his lovely little lambs of the Lord - the supreme power and glory and righteousness of the Almighty. With as much moxie and fervour to rival every God-forsaken gang-bang and orgy he's ever been in, his insatiable charm and irreverent personality will deliver the word of God and sermons from on high, with such thundering intensity of passion, and graceful supremacy of wit, that you too, will become a believer, baptised in the joy juice of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ! But, do some old habits die hard? The Agony & The Ecstasy felt the touch! is a biting and irreverent mockumentary that proves the ago old theory that the pathway to hell and hilarity if often paved with the best intentions.
