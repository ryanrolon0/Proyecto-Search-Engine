Second Moon

 Q is an agent of an underground organization called "Art of Love." Art of Love generates revenue by helping suburban housewives cheat on their husbands under the guise of free love. One day, Q runs into M, a transient Korean girl. M develops a fever, and Q shelters her for a week. Q senses a peculiar compassion developing for M. Don Jim, the leader of Art of Love, strictly forbids his agents from involvement in monogamous intimate relationships. Q decides to severe his relationship with M. But after M recovers, she starts cooking gourmet dishes. The seductive force of her food cripples Q's aspiration for freedom and jeopardizes his loyalty to Don Jim. Q has to choose between free love and one love--lightness and heaviness--in his quest for ultimate happiness.
