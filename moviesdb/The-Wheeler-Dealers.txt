The Wheeler Dealers

 Henry Tyroone comes to New York from Texas with a lot of oil money to play with in the stock market. He meets stock analyst Molly Thatcher and the two fall in love. Big time Texas Wheeler Dealer (Ivy league educated, but plays dumb) runs out of money and goes to NYC to raise 1.5 million. Great cast, romantic sub plot, and shows how knowing the tax code can make you rich!! A great movie for entrepreneurs to learn from (as is "The Card" with Alec Guinness).
