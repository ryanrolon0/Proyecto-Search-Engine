Ship A-Hooey

 Under Captain Herman, work for each mouse-sailor is more like play. But the fun ends when they bring aboard a castaway who turns out to be Katnip the Pirate. An eyepatch and a peg leg are no indications of serious handicaps to this mean, knife-wielding villain of the sea. Soon all the mice are chased off the ship and onto the life raft they had "rescued" Katnip from. The captain immediately sneaks back on deck, determined that Katnip will go down, but not with his ship.
