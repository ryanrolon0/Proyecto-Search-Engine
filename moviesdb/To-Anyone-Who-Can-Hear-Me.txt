To Anyone Who Can Hear Me

 Mother and son, are running away from abusing husband and father. A young couple are about to became parents. A little girl is on her way to school. A stressed business man. A broken hearted girl. All together on a train journey, telling the life story of an old couple. These characters carry a heavy load on their shoulders pain, betrayal, angst, impotence to change, search for love, moments of happiness, giving up and, always last, hope.
