The Thaw

 At a remote Arctic research station, four ecology students discover the real horror of global warming is not the melting ice, but what's frozen within it. A prehistoric parasite is released from the carcass of a Woolly Mammoth upon the unsuspecting students who are forced to quarantine and make necessary sacrifices, or risk infecting the rest of the world. The famous and infamous ecologist Dr. David Krupien is leading a research in the Arctic with his assistants Jane and Edward about the impact of the global warming in polar bears. Dr. Krupien's daughter Evelyn and the students Federico Fulce, Ling Chen and Atom Galen are invited to join the expedition. However, Dr. Krupien and his team discover a deadly prehistoric parasite in a mammoth and Dr. Krupien asks the helicopter pilot Bart to call off the travel of Evelyn and leave her in Dawson City, Yukon. However, the rebel Evelyn forces Bart to take her to the base station. Sooner the group finds Jane that is terminal and contaminated by the parasite, and they also discover that she had sabotaged the helicopter and shot Dr. Krupien and Edward. When they find that the bugs in the base are lethal, Evelyn and Atom decides to stay in quarantine to contain the contamination and call the CDC. However, Fed releases a distress signal, calls a helicopter and destroys the radio.
