The Stanford Prison Experiment

 A drama based on an experiment conducted in the summer of 1971 at Stanford University, where undergraduate students assumed the roles of prison guards and inmates. Within a single day, the psychological profiles of the students had changed, and the interaction between prisoners and guards grew violent. When the prisoners staged a revolt, the study was immediately shut down, creating a legacy that grows more popular as years pass.
