Rice Cultivation in Bali & the System of Rice Intensification

 A new method of planting rice in Bali is protecting indigenous seed stocks, traditions and livelihoods, thanks to a local organization's commitment to sharing knowledge and skills in sustainable permaculture practices. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI), developed originally in Madagascar, is a method of cultivating rice that can double the yield of conventional rice harvests, while requiring 90% less seed, 80% less water, and no chemical inputs. The impacts of this new method are far-reaching, offering more income for farmers and their families, as well as a healthier environment for future generations. The Paradigm Shift Project has documented these impacts and the needs of the local community for more training workshops on the SRI method, led by local Balinese organization Tri Hita Karana Bali.
