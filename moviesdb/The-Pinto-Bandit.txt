The Pinto Bandit

 The masked Pinto Bandit is shooting Collins' pony express riders. Tom Torrant is suspected as he rides a pinto horse. The Texas Rangers arrive and finding an unusual bullet size used by the Bandit, start their search for the owner of that gun. Kitty Collins ('Mady Lawrence' (qv)) and her brother Walter ('James Martin (I)' (qv)) operate a mail-line between Yuba and Gold Center. One of their two pony-express riders has been killed by a masked bandit who rides a pinto pony. Texas Rangers "Tex" Wyatt ('Dave O'Brien (I)' (qv)), Jim Steele ('James Newill' (qv)) and "Panhandle" Perkins ('Guy Wilkerson' (qv))are sent to investigate. They come upon Walter just as he has been shot by the unknown bandit, who makes an escape. The Rangers take Walter to Kitty's house. Doc Carson ('Ed Cassidy (I)' (qv))extracts an unusual bullet (.42 caliber) from the wound and places it upon a table near an open window. Kitty suspects Tom Torrant ('Jack Ingram (I)' (qv))is the Pinto Bandit, since he operates a stagecoach line from Yuba to Gold center, and rides a pinto horse. But "Spur" Sneeley ('Charles King (II)' (qv)), a crooked deputy sheriff also has his eye on gaining control of the mail contract.
