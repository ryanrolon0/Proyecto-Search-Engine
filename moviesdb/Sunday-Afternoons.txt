Sunday Afternoons

 An 80 year-old couple, who have been together for presumably at least half a century, honor one another with an intimate dance that they've done every Sunday afternoon, since their marriage began. Despite where they are at in their lives, their emotions, their relationship; they make time every weekend to honor who they are as partners and as a whole.
