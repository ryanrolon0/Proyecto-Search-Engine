The Gospel According to Booze, Bullets & Hot Pink Jesus, Act I

 After a tragic incident gets the eccentric Mister Michaels expelled from the seminary and banned from the priesthood, he sets off on a dark new path. He becomes the Missionary Man, a traveling sinister minister spreading the Gospel with one hand while he robs you blind with the other. But when a mysterious and mesmerising stranger suddenly shows up with an offer too good to be true, Mister Michaels soon finds out that the sins of the past always have a wicked way of catching up with you. When the line between damnation and salvation disappears, how far would you go for revenge?
