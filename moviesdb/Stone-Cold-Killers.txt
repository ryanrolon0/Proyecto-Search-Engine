Stone Cold Killers

 LOS JODEDORES portrays the complexity of survival amidst a backdrop of drugs, violence and poverty. Honest in its direct portrayal of erratic human behavior, the film draws the audience into the hearts and minds of these characters. Cheo, Frankie, Pachi and Armond have little or no choices, but they are neither one-dimensional nor simply defined by their drug-dealing trade- they are complex characters in their own rights. With chilling insight, Duran offers a scathing look into a tumultuous and vilified underground culture with an unadorned sincerity.
