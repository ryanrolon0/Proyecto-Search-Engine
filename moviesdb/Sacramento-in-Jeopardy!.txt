Sacramento in Jeopardy!

 A local version of the popular TV game show, Sacramento in Jeopardy! features contestants (they might be your neighbors) matching their knowledge of regional trivia and being cheered on by an enthusiastic community audience. The friendly competition is strained when a snarky D-list "celebrity" is pressed into service as the guest host. Hostile and condescending to the locals, Aleck Alenko's anger over his "cow-town gig" is met with patience and humor sophistication. We're talking about truth AND consequences! See if Aleck's bad attitude gets him run over by the wheels of fortune!
