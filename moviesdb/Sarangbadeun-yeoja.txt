Sarangbadeun yeoja

 Raised by her divorced father, Hye-suk is a little on the wild side. She steals money in order to buy instruments to form a band after dropping out of school. However, she soon needs more money to get her band booked in clubs, so she begins to pawn her father's antiques until a suspicious pawnbroker reports her to the police.
