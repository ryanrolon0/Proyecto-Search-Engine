Timon's Friendship Adventure

 Based on Shakespeare's "Timon of Athens", Timon's Friendship Adventure is the story of a jovial, plump, rich man. His main concern is the happiness of those around him-so much so that his generosity soon results in his own bankruptcy. When he asks his friends for loans he discovers that friendship can sometimes be a one-way street.
