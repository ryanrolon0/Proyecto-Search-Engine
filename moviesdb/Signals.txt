Signals

 During the 1950's soldiers for the U.S. and Russian governments were the subjugate victims of remote viewing, mind control and behavior modification experiments. American soldier Nick Marconi, after surviving decades of abuse and chemical experimentation at the hands of both countries, eventually escapes from the confines of the U.S. government. Little did they know, they had unwittingly created a man who can heal himself and others, does not age, and has powers such as telekinesis and remote viewing. While on the run, not only does he discover and begin using these powers, he also discovers that he has a child created through artificial insemination with sperm collected from Nick while being held as a test subject by the government. Zack's powers are ten-fold that of Nick's, and after finding out that Zack and his mother are also on the run from Russian and American agents, Nick must find them before they are captured and "disappear" beneath the secret government cloak of experimentation and exploitation.
