Twisted Illusions 2

 20 years ago, Tim Ritter and Joel Wynkoop started their careers with a little anthology movie called TWISTED ILLUSIONS. Joined by filmmaker John Bowker, they've now come full circle in this exciting and highly-anticipated sequel. In a grand salute to the drive-in era of moviemaking, these skilled auteurs deliver three uniquely TWISTED tales of horror and suspense. John Bowker digs up BETRAYAL, a story of revenge from beyond the grave. Joel D. Wynkoop is a triple threat actor/director/star (co-written by M. Catherine Holseybrook) with his segment called THE PART, following an actor who goes over the edge trying to get a horror movie role. And lastly, writer/director Tim Ritter returns to form with a bizarre 40-minute suspense piece about a woman (scream queen Jasi Cotton Lanier) being stalked by a maniac for the most unorthodox reasons imaginable in DEXTER DEADBEAT. Truly, this is the sequel fans have been waiting for!
