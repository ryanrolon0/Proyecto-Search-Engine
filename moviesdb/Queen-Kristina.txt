Queen Kristina

 Crowned Queen at the age of six, Kristina of Sweden was raised like a prince of the realm, but could not enjoy a man's freedom of thought and expression. But upon the arrival to the court of two profound forces - French philosopher Rene Descartes and Lady in Waiting, Ebba Sparre - Kristina undergoes a political, philosophical and spiritual awakening that is matched only by a powerful sexual transformation.
