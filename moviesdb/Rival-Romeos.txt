Rival Romeos

 Heckle and Jeckle, despite the animals falling in love all around, swear they won't. Of course, immediately after they say this, a pretty girl drops a hanky, and they fight over her. Jeckle hides in a gift box; Heckle nails Jeckle into a rocket, then mails him to Mexico. Jeckle returns with a bull. They both swear off dames, until, of course, another one walks by.
