Urva

 Urva is a short documentary, which takes place in a remote village called Urva in Kastamonu, Turkey. The premise of the movie lies within filming a dematerializing setting, vanishing aesthetic of a certain space, a soon to be lost culture that has no room in the reality of Turkey and the world at large.
