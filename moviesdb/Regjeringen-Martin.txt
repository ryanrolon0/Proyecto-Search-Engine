Regjeringen Martin

 Martin is going on a blinddate and in his internal government the ministers are preparing for a routine State visit. But then Nora is revealed and tactics need to be changed. Fast! Nora is not interested in foreign political smalltalk, she is after government secrets. The ridiculed Home Secretary is slowly coming to life, but in his way stands a paranoid Defense Secretary. Only a coup can save Martin now!
