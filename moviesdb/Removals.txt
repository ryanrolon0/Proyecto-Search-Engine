Removals

 Andy, and his work mate Ronnie start out on a ordinary day, doing an ordinary moving job. On the way to the job they accidentally run over the man who hired them, he is badly injured and they put him in their removal van and head to the hospital. Unfortunately the pair become a nexus for a series of bizarre occurrences which leave them with a van full of corpses and nowhere to hide.
