September in the Rain

 The rain is outdoors; the action is indoors, in a grocery store, where the characters on product labels come to life (along with one real worm). While much of the picture features characters in blackface, and hence is usually censored, the remaining part includes a bottle of blueing singing "Am I Blue", a snake charmer from a coffee can playing for a tube of toothpaste, an elegant dancing couple from cigarette packs, the umbrella girl on a salt box under a waterfall, and some baby chicks from cleanser cans chasing the aforementioned worm.
