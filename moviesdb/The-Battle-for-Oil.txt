The Battle for Oil

 A WWII documentary produced for and by the Canadian Government Film services as part of the "World in Action" short-subject series. It uses stock footage, dating back to WWI, in its theme of showing how dependent modern war-vehicles are on having a fuel-supply source. In WWI, Britain's sea power was preserved through the maintenance of a series of coaling stations dotting the Seven Seas. With the change to oil, rather than coal, the necessities for European nations, without home supply, are dependent on the Near-and-Far East where the pipe-lines and oil production have to be defended against attacks by the Axis powers.
