Simón Bolívar

 During 1817-1823 the people of Venezuela fought for independence against the Spanish colonial army. General Boliviar tries to unify the rebel parties, but it's hard since they differ in descent and race. But in a risky fight against a numerical superior army convoy he can convince the other leaders. Further on he's the "Libertator". He starts to call all men into his new army. His vision is to free not only Venezuela, but all American countries.
