The Favor

 A hit-man (Robert) is convinced to take one more job before he goes into retirement. Reluctantly he takes on a target that breaks one of his key rules; no women. What he doesn't know is that there is another unspoken rule when it comes to his line of work, one that he will soon be finding out.
