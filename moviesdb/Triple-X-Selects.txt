Triple X Selects

 Swedish Wildcats, Italian Lesbionic Nuns, Frisky Inmates in South American Prisons, Euro Lesbo Vampires and a vast assortment of Sapphic Sleaze. This is Sexploitation. Exploitation. Gridhouse. To be Polite or Academic we call it Erotic Cinema. Whatever your term of choice, this genre's glory days blasted through the 60's and 70's. None of these films were strictly lesbian, or even for lesbians but this historic montage will change that. Here are Erotic Cinema's heroines of the 60's and 70's, fighting, tempting, teasing and fucking each other. These ladies are depraved, filthy-dirty and insatiable. You will be too.
