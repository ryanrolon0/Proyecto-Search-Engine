Summer Light

 Set in a lush world resembling a cross between post-apocalyptic Africa and 18th century Europe, Summer Light explores a young boy's vile existence imprisoned in a junkyard by his cruel master, Glack. Travelers come and go, peruse Glack's wares and sometimes buy. When one day an aristocratic gentleman arrives with eyes for the boy, Glack's greed overcomes him. As for the boy, the opportunity is not about commodities, but about long held visions of freedom and happiness.
