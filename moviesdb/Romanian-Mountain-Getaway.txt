Romanian Mountain Getaway

 Four energetic Romanian boys want to get away from city life for a while and enjoy a naturist day in the spectacular Carpathian Mountains. As it turned out, it was too cold to swim in the fast-moving mountain stream, so after a picnic and some roughhousing, they moved on to a lavish naturist resort where they took advantage of a sauna. Awe-inspiring scenery.
