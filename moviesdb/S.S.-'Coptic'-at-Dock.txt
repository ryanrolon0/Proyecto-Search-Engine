S.S. 'Coptic' at Dock

 Taken at the docks of the Pacific Steamship Co., San Francisco, Cal., which is operated in connection with the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. The "Coptic" is one of the best appointed, largest and fastest vessels that traverse the Pacific Ocean, and this view was taken as she was leaving for a voyage to the Sandwich Islands, Japan and China. The multitude of people crowding the decks and dock, waving hands, hats, &c, to each other, makes a stirring and life like scene. The picture is clear and sharp and the figures show life size.
