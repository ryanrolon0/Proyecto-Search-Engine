Rozwój

 In the Ojcow National Park, in the very center of a nature preserve, there is a Care Centre. It is a shelter for 70 old men. They are mentally deficient and insane, waiting for death to come. The Centre is their whole world and nothing else exists beyond it. Everything behind the window is as remote and extraordinary as cosmic space. They don 't greatly differ from us. They each live in individual realities that are appropriate for their level of development. They fight with their own limitations and display every reaction caused by the effort to exceed these boundaries. Therefore, their encounters with other people are very solemn acts; their own spiritual victory. As a matter of fact, it is all about personal development. What we all have in common is the most important task - the desire to become a real human being by way of love. Before our very eyes, the new millennium opens for the Centre inmates.
