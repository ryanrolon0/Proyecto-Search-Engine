Tinsel

 A 1990 documentary team explored the longing, mystery and obsession that movies create in people. The filmmakers traveled across the US, talking to people trying to break into the film industry, as well as industry insiders like Linda Obst, Phil Alden Robinson, Art Buchwald, Rob Cohen, Martin Landau, Sid Caesar and many others. The 1990 film was never shown publicly. In 2010 the footage was rediscovered and re-edited. TINSEL is a fascinating time-capsule of the Hollywood of 20 years ago, a film explores the unchanging power that motion pictures have the human imagination.
