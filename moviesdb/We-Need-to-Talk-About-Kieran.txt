We Need to Talk About Kieran

 Turning down an offer from Harvard, bumbling genius Kieran Edwards opts to follow his true love Juliet to The University of Nottingham. Within days of arriving, he finds her in bed with a muscular sportsman. Heartbroken and vulnerable, Kieran finds himself as the unlikely student of a pick up guru. Using an array of unorthodox techniques, Kieran immerses himself in a new area of study with geeky enthusiasm. To the surprise of his teacher and his contemporaries, Kieran becomes a phenomenon on the Nottingham dating scene. As his success levels soar out of control, Kieran's studies and morals begin to suffer. Can the friendship of an unusual course tutor tempt him out of the late night bars and back into the library? A 21st Century Romantic Comedy combining the fun and frolics of American campus movies with a twist of dark British humour. Set against the attractive backdrops of picture postcard Oxford colleges and the vibrant student community of Nottingham, this is a fresh, funny, and light-hearted movie aimed at a wide audience.
