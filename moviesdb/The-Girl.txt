The Girl

 Christmas Eve wasn't so festive when a disturbed mother of three slashed her husband and two of her children in an old campground. Years later, the surviving daughter falls victim to a random rape, activating painful childhood memories and turning "The Girl" into a murderous (albeit sexy) freak, inventively killing everyone in sight! This campground massacre dedicated to the late Corey Haim features an all-star horror cast!
