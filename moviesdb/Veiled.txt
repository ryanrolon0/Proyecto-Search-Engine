Veiled

 Nine-year old Sia suddenly experiences severe pain in her shoulder while watching a local news story about a rapist attack. With no medical explanation, her parents become even more concerned when they find her practicing knife throwing and proclaiming, "There's a dead man in the house." They finally give in to a psychologist's recommendation that Sia be hypnotized in order to connect the current conundrum with an event in Sia's past life. Is she healed? In the dark of night, we find the unexpected answer to the mystery.
