Shwet

 'Shwet' looks at the quantifiable and unquantifiable nature of pain. The former is the kind of pain whose enormity, causes, and impact on one's life are clearly evident. Unquantifiable pain need not stem from a singular, tangible source, its destructive potential is not immediately apparent. It is the struggle against pain that binds the protagonists of the film together. The form of this film continues to render each primary impression into a distant secondary, to the extent that it all seems to happen so far away, in a time that isn't near us, in a life that's so distant that we do not identify with it any sense of urgency. The film tries to uncover this distance
