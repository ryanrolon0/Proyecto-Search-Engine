The Lunatics' Ball

 A psychologist discovers he only has months left to live and turns a psychiatric hospital upside down as he challenges the conventional psychiatric wisdom and drug treatments as he works with a group teenage psychiatric patients. In the process he falls in love with Charlotte, a doctor, but pushes her away afraid of becoming involved. He achieves mixed results with his patients, but ultimately achieves a measure of love and recognition.
