Pyaasa

 Suraj Thakur (Aftab Shivdasani) is one of three children in the Thakur household. He has a brother, Prem (Zulfi Sayed), and a sister, Suman (Saadhika). Suraj does not measure up to his dad's (Govind Namdeo) expectations and is often spoken to at home. Suraj wants to be rich quick, and marry one of the most beautiful girls in the world. His dreams become reality when he meets with Sheetal (Yukta Mookhey), who is a multi-millionaire business-woman. Though Suraj has no affection for Sheetal, he decides he can get really wealthy if he marries Sheetal. But Sheetal spurns him, and as a result Suraj spins a web of deception that forces Sheetal to marry him, and at the same time, teach his father a lesson for criticising him all the time. But Suraj is in for a surprise, as fate has other plans for him.
