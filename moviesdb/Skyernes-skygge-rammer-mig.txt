Skyernes skygge rammer mig

 Copenhagen in the 50s. Jens is a law student with a part-time job in a law firm. He lives at home and is more or less engaged to Lis. Jens' life is very regular and organized. Until he meets slightly older Erhard, a head clerk at the firm. Erhard lures Jens into the mysterious city night life, and from now on, Jens' life changes. The engagement is broken off and his education is neglected.
