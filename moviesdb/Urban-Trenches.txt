Urban Trenches

 Urban Trenches was born from my experiences working the streets of Toronto as a police officer. It draws on the realities of inner-city living from opposing perspectives. The film is a snap shot of inner-city living from those that live it. From the perspective of a gang member and a police officer - that have more in common then expected.
