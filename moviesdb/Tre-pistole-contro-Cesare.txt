Tre pistole contro Cesare

 A gunman teams up with his long-lost brothers--a French hypnotist and a Japanese kung-fu expert--to fight a villain who is obsessed with Roman emperor Julius Caesar, to the point of having built a palace, complete with slave girls, a huge sunken bath and his own "Praetorian Guard", and who is trying to cheat them out of a gold mine left to them by their father.
