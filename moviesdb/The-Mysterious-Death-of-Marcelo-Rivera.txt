The Mysterious Death of Marcelo Rivera

 The Pacific Rim Mining Company has been lobbying for years for drilling rights under the mountain of El Dorado, an ironically named landmark in El Salvador containing over $1.3 billion worth of gold and precious metals. These resources come at a price however - severe environmental and human rights concerns have fueled a healthy resistance against the company and their mining practices. This short film takes a close look at the recent death of activist Marcelo Rivera, the current class-action lawsuit against El Salvador's government, and the connections between the two.
