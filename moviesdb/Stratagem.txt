Stratagem

 Two government agents are sent to investigate a solid steel room that people enter, but don't come out of. They soon realize that the only way to discover the secret of the room's origin is to seek out the aid of an ex-magician/escape artist who has been convicted of murdering her husband. Little do they know that this merciless room is only the beginning of what will be the adventure of their lives.
