The World's Best Prom

 For over 50 years in Racine, Wisconsin, prom mania grips the entire town of 80,000 residents. Racine's extravagance begins with a parade of limos, fire engines, trucks, boats, and even elephants, carrying students through the streets to the red carpet waiting at the citywide prom as residents keep their eyes glued to the live television coverage of the spectacular event. The film focuses on two very different girls and one boy who provide an all-access pass to the days and nights leading up to their unbelievable prom night. A revealing epilogue catches up with Tonya, Dori, Ben and six more of the film's teenage subjects four years later, allowing us to see whose hopes and dreams are coming true, and whether prom is still the greatest night of their lives.
