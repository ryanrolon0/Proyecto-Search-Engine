Remembering Inninimowin

 Inninimowin (Cree) is spoken in several Native communities across Canada. Although it is considered one of the most preserved Native languages; it is also at risk of disappearing. This goal of this documentary is to mend the gaps in understanding between generations by exposing the harsh treatment of Native peoples and moving towards reconciliation and healing. Remembering Inninimowin captures the lost conversations between generations.
