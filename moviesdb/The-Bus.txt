The Bus

 A homemade mobile music venue from Oakland, California that runs on veggie oil. The film follows the bus as it travels from town to town with a vibrant crew of itinerants, chronicling the high and low points of life surrounding this unique temporary art space and social utopia. The film opens on a several dozen people walking towards the sound of an exciting underground party. Inside the small space, people are rocking out to a band on a small stage. In a dark corner, a hooded twenty-something on a cellphone reveals to his friend that he's at an amazing party with bands on a bus that runs on vegetable oil. Over the course of a nine day U.S. summer tour, filmmaker Ryan Junell lived on "the bus" and discreetly kept the camera rolling. Scenes in the short film include bands - details of the bus's vegetable oil conversion system - the quest for waste veggie oil - how people on tour stay in shape - the struggle to keeping an old bus on the road - a group jam session at a center for people with disabilities... The Bus is an intimate look at the lengths a creative community will go to share their talents and inspire people outside of their given radius. The bus itself is an answer to a problem experienced by a specific niche of creative people in America, "How can we get our art to communities in towns A B and C when we can't even afford the cost of getting there?" Using cooperative do-it-yourself strategies, the bus and its riders are raw evidence of human resourcefulness, ingenuity, and willpower.
