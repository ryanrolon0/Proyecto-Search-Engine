Warchild

 Part of a trilogy of experimental documentaries done on South East Collegiate students. South East is a boarding school in Winnipeg for Aboriginal youth coming from the North. This short film recalls the esthetic of traditional Japanese cinema. It portrays a young solitary figure seeking its place in society. His journey from North to the city encapsulates his struggle to become responsible and seek serenity.
