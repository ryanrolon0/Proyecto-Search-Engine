The Hand That Rocks the Cradle

 Peyton Flanders seemed to be the perfect nanny, but secretly she was out to wreck the lives of the family she was supposed to be helping. Before becoming the nanny, Peyton had a miscarriage, and blamed it on Claire (the mother). Claire suspects nothing, having never met Peyton before. Dr. Victor Mott is a respected and successful gynecologist, but his respect and success both come to a crashing halt when he is accused of sexually molesting his patients. When Claire Bartel accuses him of this crime, four other women come forward to corroborate the story and also accuse the doctor. Stripped of his license and on the verge of being sent to prison, Dr. Mott commits suicide. As if this were not enough of a blow to Dr. Mott's now-widowed wife, she suffers a miscarriage, losing her unborn baby as well, and is on the verge of losing her home to civil judgments against her husband's estate. Broken, alone and now near-penniless to boot, Mrs. Mott learns that Claire is seeking a nanny for her own young children, and sees this as the perfect tool to exact a bloody revenge on Claire Bartel, and take Claire's family for her own... A gynecologist commits suicide when he is accused of having sexually molested 5 of his patients, and his wife loses her unborn baby as a result of stress. She then takes on another name and applies to the nanny position that the first woman to make the accusation has announced. She gets the job and she's up for revenge in her sly ways.
