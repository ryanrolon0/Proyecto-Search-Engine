The Noble Savage

 The Noble Savage is the story of a man who goes for a job interview only to find himself alone, locked on the roof of the tallest skyscraper in Manhattan. He discovers that his cell phone signal is dead, and that building security is not coming to his aid. He must face the days and nights that stretch into weeks, and find a way to survive the most famous island of all time, high above the sea of streetlights and foot traffic below.
