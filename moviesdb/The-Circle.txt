The Circle

 Unsure if it is a nightmare, or a complete lapse into a schizophrenic reality, Virgil awakes suddenly to find himself imprisoned in a strange room, with no memory of how and why he is there. Soon after waking he becomes locked, unwillingly, into a bizarre and horrifying ritual which seems to hold the key to his past. When he awakes again, he discovers that time has reset, and he is forced to keep re-living the same horrifying sequence again, and again. On the boundary between schizophrenic nightmare and psychological hell, the circle draws Virgil deeper into the chambers of his mind, where a strange force is trying to show him something.
