Sjaak the World

 'Sjaak The World' is the story of a man living his dream while logging 154,568 miles through 75 countries - over the course of 5 years and COMPLETELY ALONE on his motorcycle. Extreme terrain was encountered, including the deep mud of the Congo, the endless sands of the Sahara and the muddy waters of many rivers. These challenges and countless others were met and overcome. Why is this story different from any other motorcycle road trip? It's different because this is REALLY the story of the journey that we all take. The journey to the heart and search for the way to balance our reality and our dreams. This is the story of Sjaak Lucassen. Come along for the ride. Come along for the inspiration.
