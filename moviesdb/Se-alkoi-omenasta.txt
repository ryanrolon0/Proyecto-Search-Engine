Se alkoi omenasta

 Autobiographical vanity showcase commissioned by Tabe Slioor, a self-made socialite and notorious symbol of loosening morals in early 1960s Finland. The film exploits the scandal she caused as the secret mistress of the mayor of Helsinki. Left unfinished because of her quarrels with the production company, the story relies heavily on her shamelessly narcissistic narration.
