Shuya Show

 _Shuya Show (2009)_ (qv) is a light-hearted satire that follows oppressed factory worker, Provar Parpüpoff, on his quest to find his polka hero, Marty Shuya. A liar in love, Provar must escort (by any means possible) the musical legend to his school reunion in order to impress his long-lost crush, Pheet.
