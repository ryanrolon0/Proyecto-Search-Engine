Untitled Camryn Manheim Pilot

 The WB's untitled Chuck Ranberg-Anne Flett-Giordano comedy is about about a single mother of three (Camryn Manheim) with a 1970s rock 'n roll sensibility that moves into an upscale neighborhood and clashes with the resident Gucci-Pucci Mommy Militia. A hard-working single mother who doesn't suffer fools gladly, Camryn moves across town into her parents' old house so that her three kids, Arlo, Crosby and Joni - all named after Camryn's old rock idols - can attend better schools and live in a nicer area. Badly out of sync with the yuppie "Mommy Militia" that rules the neighborhood, Camryn refuses to conform to their shallow standards and ultimately winds up giving the community's stodgy status quo a go.
