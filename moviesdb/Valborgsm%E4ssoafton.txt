Valborgsmässoafton

 Lena Bergström works in an office and is unhappily in love with her boss, Johan Borg. She decides to quit. Borg's wife won't have any children, and when she becomes pregnant she has an illegal abortion. For some reason, Lena's father believes that it is Lena who has had an abortion. At Walpurgis Night people gather around bonfires and in restaurants to celebrate the coming of spring. Johan Borg has booked a table for two, hoping to pour new spirit into his dying marriage. He is longing for a family life, with children of his own, but his wife Clary opposes it. In fact, she has planned to undergo an illegal abortion this very afternoon - without her husband's knowledge. Because of this she refuses to spend the evening with him. Johan then invites his secretary Lena to celebrate Walpurgis Night with him at the restaurant. He explains to her that his marriage is over. Johan and Lena have a wonderful evening together and fall in love. Meanwhile the police have spotted the illegal abortionist. Clary is weak after her abortion, but escapes just before the police arrive. A small crook finds some evidence for Clary's illegal abortion, and tries to blackmail Clary and Johan. When Johan refuses to pay him more than 5.000 crowns he attacks Johan. In the turmoil the crook loses his gun, Clary picks it up and shoots him down. It is an act of self-defense, but Johan and Clary are chocked and tries to erase all evidence of the deed. Johan flees the country and joins the Foreign Legion. Before committing suicide Clary confesses that she killed the crook and that Johan is innocent. Lena, who is unhappy because of Johan's disappearance, wants to bring him the news, but doesn't know where to find him.
