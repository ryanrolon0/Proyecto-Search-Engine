The Punching Dummy

 Hurling expletives at women to one guy is not a bad thing and is even encouraged. Doug does just that at a women's defense class as the fully padded and deeply loathed Punching Dummy. With the help of Coach Cindy who runs the clinic he plans to empower these women through this bizarre method. He has all that he can handle in one such woman in the class, but she may just be the key to helping him. Behind his deep, shock absorbing pads lies a very big heart.
