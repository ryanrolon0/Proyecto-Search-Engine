Us the Damned and God Himself

 Five college students are driving back from the funeral of a mutual friend. The driver pulls off the freeway and stops the car in the middle of a railroad crossing. 'I think one of you killed her,' he says. The next train comes by in 9 minutes and he's not moving that car until the murderer's identity is discovered.
