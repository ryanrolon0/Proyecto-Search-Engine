The Last Yoghurt

 It's late. Sarah catches Graham sneaking in the kitchen. He is after the last yoghurt. The childish couple begin arguing over who deserves the yoghurt more. Graham tries to outwit his wife, but she knows him too well. Their game soon spirals out of control and into a physical contest. Who will win the last yoghurt? Or will they share it?
