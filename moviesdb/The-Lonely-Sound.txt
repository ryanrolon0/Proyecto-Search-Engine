The Lonely Sound

 In the disturbing yet intoxicating short film The Lonely Sound, from director Joe Harris and creative collective Team Amstellardam, there exists a morbidly poetic tale of obsession, love, regret, and despair. One woman, hopelessly tied to the exalted memory of a lost love, struggles to walk the line between the crippling loneliness of her stark reality and a steady descent into an ethereal, heartbroken madness. As her dreams of worldly happiness lay dying, her thoughts turn to the nightmarish obsessions of an eternal union that exists beyond the plane of the living.
