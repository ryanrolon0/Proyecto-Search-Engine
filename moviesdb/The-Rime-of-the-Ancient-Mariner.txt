The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

 A British travelogue that cycles in the footsteps of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge whilst also somehow being lost at sea with The Ancient Mariner. The film knits together The Mariner's tale with drama, reminiscence, writing & animation to make a psychedelic yet perfect mix between entertainment, community outreach and human interest.
