Revengers Inc.

 "Revengers Inc." centers around 3 misfit girls in an acting school. The Revengers - Belinda, Freedom, and Kato, quirky and lovable, yet not A List material. Belinda is the "Dreamer", Freedom is the "Brains", and Kato is the "Bod" of the three. The Revengers are plagued by the fame-seeking Hiltons. Tara, the Queen B Bitch. Hillary, the "peaches and cream", and Meredith, the token acting school slut. When The Revengers misguided attempts to fit in fail they decide to exact a fitting revenge upon the Hilton's with the help of Steven and Stephen, or the Steves. the school's AV-squad tech-heads. They challenge the Hilton's to a competition, the prize being the chance to dog walk/ personal assist for Dakotah West, a graduate of the school who is now a famous musician. The two teams compete in various humorous ways, each trying to out do the other for the honor of becoming Dakotah's assistant.
