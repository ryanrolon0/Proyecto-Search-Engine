The End of Light

 The Life Behind The End of Light On August 13th, 2006, at 11 men dressed in black entered the hello Hollywood mini mart in east San Jose. An argument arose between the men and the owner, Bruce Lee, when all of the sudden, one of the men pulled out a 12 Gage shotgun, and fired one shot into the clerk. It took 3 minutes for my friend and colleague to bleed out. He was dead before 911 arrived, and his assailants have never been caught. When I heard on the news that they were describing my friend as murder victim number 17, I knew something greater had to be done for his memory. So to his honor, and the honor of his widow and daughter, I set out to make the End of Light. The script was in development for about a month and a half, casting took place the first weekend in November, I rehearsed the actors that week, and we shot for 3 days, November 10, 11, and 12, with a crew of four. The hours were lousy, the food not bad, but we had the spirit; the spirit of a great and wonderful man. Shooting went off without a hitch, an unheard of weekend in the eyes of this director.
