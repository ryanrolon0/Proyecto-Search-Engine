 Mirror Boy is an enthralling journey through Gambia, seen through the eyes of London-born 12 year old Tijan (Edward Kagutuzi).

On their arrival in Banjul, Tijan encounters an apparition of a boy smiling at him in a mirror and vanishing. Seeing the same boy in a crowded street market the next day sets in motion a chain of events that culminates in him getting lost. While Tijan's panic-stricken mother struggles to find her son in an intriguing game of survival brinkmanship, Tijan is left alone in the company of the enigmatic Mirror Boy, who is only visible to him. A bruising spiritual rite of passage, Mirror Boy takes Tijan on a magical and mystical journey.
