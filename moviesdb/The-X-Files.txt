The X Files

 Fox Home Entertainment will release a 2-disc DVD collection of 8 one-hour episodes of The X-Files on July 8, 2008. The DVD collection, titled The X-Files Revelations, is dubbed as an "Essential Guide To The X-Files Movie" because all eight episodes were handpicked by the series creator Chris Carter because they tie-in with the July 25th theatrical release of X-Files 2.
