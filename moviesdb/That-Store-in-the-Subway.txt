That Store in the Subway

 A documentary on the closing of Record Mart, the landmark music store in the Times Square subway station in New York City, hailed by The New York Times as "the University of Latin Music". With the sweeping renovations of the Times Square station, long planned and finally carried out, Record Mart - after 40 years in business - was forced to close. But that closing represented more than the loss of simply another small enterprise tucked away in an underground corner of a subway station... a little, quite extraordinary store known, admired and patronized by music aficionados nation-wide. It represented as well a deeply felt cultural loss to New York's vibrant Latino community and to the city at large in which it had, over the years, played such a unique and meaningful role.
