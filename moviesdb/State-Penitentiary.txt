State Penitentiary

 Roger Manners ('Warner Baxter' (qv)), a former aircraft manufacturer is wrongly accused and convicted of embezzlement of $400,000 and is given a long prison sentence. There he must decide rather or not to get involved in a prison break, or stay there while his wife, Shirley ('Karin Booth' (qv)), can prove his innocence by playing at romance with the real culprit. More stock footage and narration than dialogue.
