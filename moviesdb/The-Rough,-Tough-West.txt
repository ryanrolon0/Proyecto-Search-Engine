The Rough, Tough West

 Steve Holden arrives looking for his old friend Big Jack only to find he runs the town and is greatly disliked. However the cause of the conflict is Big Jack's chief henchman Fulton. Steve becomes Sheriff and he and the Durango Kid then battle Fulton as he goes after the miner's gold. Steve Holden, also the Durango Kid (Charles Starrett), arrives in a mining town and finds that his old friend Big Jack Mahoney (Jock Mahoney billed as Jack Mahoney)is operating a saloon and winning illegal control of gold mines and claims. Saloon entertainer Carolina (Carolina Cotton)is in love with Mahoney and does not know of his unorthodox deals. Smiley Burnette (billed above the title on the film and the posters and eligible for 2nd billing for those who can't read), the local fire chief, sympathizes with the miners and, as usual, provides next-to-nothing in the way of help except some songs, which are overshadowed by the music from Carolina Cotton and Pee Wee King. Mahoney gains control of the town's only outgoing road and demands toll on all of the gold shipments. But Steve, newly-appointed Sheriff, and Smiley lead the miners to a secret(?)road to the one-street town, which turns out not to be all that much of a secret as the wagons are waylaid by Mahoney's gunmen. Will Big Jack see the error of his ways and reform? Not before fire chief Smiley sings "Fire of Forty-One" he won't.
