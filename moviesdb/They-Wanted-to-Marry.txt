They Wanted to Marry

 Newspaper photographer Jim Tyler sneaks into a society girl's wedding, and the bride's sister (mad-cap heiress Sheila Hunter) decides she prefers him to her upper-crust suitors. She even likes his pigeon, who travels everywhere with him. Jim Tyler, photographer for The Daily Mail, is assigned to the wedding party of William Grover Hunter's daughter, Helen. However, he has to hide, in the room of the bride's sister, Sheila, when the publicity-shy Hunter discover he is a newspaper photographer. She helps him escape, and goes with him to the hotel-apartment of Jim's closest friend, where Sheila assumes it is Jim's apartment and orders champagne and caviar from room service. When Jim can't pay, they both end up in jail. Against her father's orders, Sheila accompanies Jim on several assignments and they are caught in a raid on a fashionable gambling casino and are once again thrown in jail. Mr. Hunter is also furious when his picture shows up in The Daily Mail as one of those caught in the raid. Mr. Hunter gets involved in more newspaper pictures and, obviously, the romance between his daughter and the photographer appears to be doomed.
