The Final Hour

 A college student is horrified when he believes he has overslept and is at risk for missing his last final. Fearing he will disappoint his parents (and their investment), he sprints to his classroom. On the way he encounters an eclectic array of prospective and enrolled college students, each with an amusing perspective of college life. Will our hero reach his final on time? Will he make his parents proud, and will he realize the true meaning of being "money well spent"? "The Final Hour" is a poignant glimpse of a stressed student's life filmed entirely on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and features the talents of Patrick Behan, Mark Crawford, and Matt Schultz with original music by Mark Crawford.
