 Sean, Kerry and Beth are three strangers whose only common goal is to work out exactly why they have been isolated in a mysterious woodland, beside a shallow grave. With no memory of how they got there and increasing levels of paranoia, the trio become entwined in a nightmarish experience which will ultimately lead to a terrifying sacrifice. But who or what is behind it all and do the answers lie closer to home than they think?
