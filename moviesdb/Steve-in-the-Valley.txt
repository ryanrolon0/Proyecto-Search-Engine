Steve in the Valley

 Steve, a well-off guy in his 20's living in Downtown San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley, has always played things safely. His best friend Casey on the other hand, is an irresponsible troublemaker who lives life on the edge. When Casey, along with their odd friend Tim, manages to drag Steve to a rave, a chain of events occur which leads to Steve's safe world to be shook up. The morning after the wild night out at the rave, Steve wakes up to find him self in a bit of a pickle. He immediately calls Casey for help; not knowing that Casey is responsible for most of what has gone wrong. To much of Steve's surprise, Casey has a plan prepared to solve this particular situation. After attempting Casey's sloppy solution, Steve learns that he is in a much bigger problem than he originally thought.
