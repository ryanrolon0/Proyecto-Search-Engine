Public

 Public is based as a poem written by filmmaker Arthur Dong in 1969 and marks his debut as an artist whose work continues to delve into the politics and human tragedy of social injustice. Public explores a child's reactions to social mores and violence to skewer the hypocrisy of oppressive norms.
