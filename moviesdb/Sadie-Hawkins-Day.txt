Sadie Hawkins Day

 Comic strip artist, Al Capp, appears in and narrates this humorous short about college students around the country (such as at Morris Harvey College in Charleston, West Virginia) who recreate 'Sadie Hawkins Day' (homely hillbilly women chasing down men for marriage) from his own "Li'l Abner' strip.
