Upgrades

 Set to Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Flight of the Bumble Bee', UPGRADES is a breakneck-paced animated parody chronicling major upgrades in computer graphics software. The project comments on the accelerating rate of change in computer technologies, or Moore's Law, and lies at the intersection of motion graphics and animation.
