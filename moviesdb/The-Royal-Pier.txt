The Royal Pier

 On the South Coast of England is a city made famous by a ship which set sail and never returned. The Royal Pier sits alongside the Southampton dock where the Titanic once departed and yet this historic building, full of memories, now lays derelict waiting to be demolished. This documentary explores the epic history which surrounds one of Southampton's most poignant landmarks through the eyes of people who knew its former glory. In its heyday The Royal Pier was a ballroom where couples met; a party venue for sailors and a nightclub where hedonistic youths engaged in nights of passion. Decades later The Royal Pier has been forgotten. Its a wind battered, sea beaten building, which many people pass by on their way to work without giving it a second thought. This documentary takes a light-hearted look at the impact one building has had on people's lives.
