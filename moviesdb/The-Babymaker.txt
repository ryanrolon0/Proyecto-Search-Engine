The Babymaker

 Married couples, unable to conceive, are thrilled to find they are going to become parents, thanks to a larger-than-life "miracle doctor" and his unusual treatments. However, joy soon turns to outrage with the discovery the physician has taken bizarre and inconceivably unethical means to deceive his patients. In some case, the doctor deliberately misled couples into falsely believing they might have a chance to become pregnant when they could not. In others, the twisted physician actually served as a "secret donor," fathering countless children himself. Outraged by these shocking discoveries, one couple leads a seemingly impossible fight to keep hopeful families from being victimized again.
