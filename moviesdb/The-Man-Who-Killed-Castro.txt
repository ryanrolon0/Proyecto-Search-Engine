The Man Who Killed Castro

 Taking place in the early sixties, after Fidel Castro has already taken over, a young poet, Emmanuel, is arguing with his wife, Marianella. He is for the Revolution while she opposes it. All Emmanuel wants is a change from the corrupt Batista, Cuba's former leader. Marianella has already seen signs of Fidel's communistic ways. In the heat of the argument, Emmanuel decides he must leave the house. He meets up with his best friend, Ruben, who is already a rebel soldier. Due to miscommunication, Ruben thinks that Emmanuel is against the new way and decides to turn him in. Later that night, Emmanuel is ripped away from his wife, tortured and held captive for information. His dreams and his faith are his only salvation.
