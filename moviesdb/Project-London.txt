Project London

 Project London is an independent, almost no-budget, feature-length, live action movie with vivid, intense, and marrow-vibrating visual effects and animations created with the open source software Blender (and other traditional software) and 250 (or so) worldwide volunteers. It's the first independent movie from writer director, Ian Hubert and features a story set in Seattle, Washington. This special effects-rich science fiction actioner is about a grief stricken young man who joins a ragtag resistance force and engages in epic battles against Joint Command to avenge his father and save the planet.
