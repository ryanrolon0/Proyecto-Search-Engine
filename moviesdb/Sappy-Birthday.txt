Sappy Birthday

 Andy Clyde wishes to go golfing but his wife and brother-in-law, Hector, are convinced that Andy needs to go on a picnic with them. Andy is not 100% in favor of this change in his plans and tries every way he knows to avoid the picnic plan. He and Hector discuss it rather loudly and wake up the policeman next door who is sleeping. This leads to further complications.
