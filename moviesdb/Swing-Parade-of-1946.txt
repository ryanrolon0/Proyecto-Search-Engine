Swing Parade of 1946

 Carol Lawrence, an aspiring singer, goes to a new night club owned by Danny Warren, whose father Daniel Warren doesn't approve of the club and wants Danny to join him in the family business. Carol is suspected of being a process server and is thrown out of the club. An extremely long arm of coincidence leads her to the elder Warren's office and he hires her as a process server. She returns but gets a singing job this time so foregoes serving the cease-and-desist notice. The Three Stooges are on hand as waiters and Connee Boswell, Louis Jordan, Will Osborne and Mary Treen provide the music and songs in addition to Gale Storn on "Oh, Buddy" and "On the Sunny Side of the Street."
