The Yellow Bird

 The film is adapted from Jay Orff's short story "Bear Paw." In the opening sentence the unfortunate protagonist of Jay's story accidentally shoots himself. It is 1917 and the story is set on the prairies of eastern Montana. The man's only chance of survival is to travel by horse-drawn cart to the nearest town, Havre. As he travels, slowly losing blood, the protagonist moves in and out of memory, reverie and fantasy. He arrives in Havre, though it is left ambiguous whether he will live or die.
