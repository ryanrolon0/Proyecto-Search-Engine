The Riding Hannefords

 A day under the Big Top with the Hannefords, a family whose riding (and show-business) tradition goes a long way back. The film includes stock footage from the Circus series of silent shorts 'Poodles' starred in, plus some previous-and-current circus performances. Performing are 'Poodles', his wife Grace, his daughter Grace, and his 75-year-old mother.
