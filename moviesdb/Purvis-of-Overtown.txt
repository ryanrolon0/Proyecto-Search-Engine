Purvis of Overtown

 After a stint in Raiford State Prison for a breaking and entering charge, Purvis Young seemed destined to fail. Yet while in prison, Purvis taught himself to paint. He became a highly acclaimed contemporary artist, now recognized nationally as an icon of Black culture and history. Purvis paints simply because that's what he needs to do.
