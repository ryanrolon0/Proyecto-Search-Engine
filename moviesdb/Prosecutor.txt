Prosecutor

 Since the 19th Century, the creation of an International Criminal cCurt to prosecute human rights violators has been a fleeting goal of international civil society. The precedent was established with the Nuremberg Trials, but never before has such an institution been created on a permanent, global basis. "Prosecutor" explores the behind- the-scenes drama of the tumultuous year-in-the-life of the court's first Chief Prosecutor, the controversial Argentinian jurist, Luis Moreno Ocampo. Ocampo's actions - including laying charges against the elected President of Sudan - are widely praised and criticized. From the learned judges, to the young Canadian lawyers, to the international legal experts addressing war crimes, the ICC is in the eye of a political and legal hurricane. Based in part on award-winning author Erna Paris's bestselling book, "The Sun Climbs Slow" and incorporating interviews, archival footage, private correspondence and documents, "Prosecutor" is an intense journey through the backroom politics and tough decisions that are at the heart of international peace and justice.
