Second Best

 Second Best is the story of five male baby boomers all nearing 50. They graduated from college together, ready to take on the world, but only one of the group has done exceptionally well. His visit back East to hang out with the old gang triggers the most intense feelings of inadequacy and "second bestness," particularly in his oldest and closest friend.
