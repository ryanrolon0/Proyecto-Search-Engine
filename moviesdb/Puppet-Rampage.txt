Puppet Rampage

 Every 2 years since 1936, the Puppeteers of America has held its national festival, a week long celebration of the art and craft of puppetry. Hundreds of puppeteers gather from all over the world to learn and perform. Now, over 70 years later, the festival is still going strong. What effect does technology have on this ancient art? Are these festivals still viable in modern times? Puppeteers ranging from unknown to legendary provide insight into these questions and more at the 2007 festival in St. Paul, Minnesota.
