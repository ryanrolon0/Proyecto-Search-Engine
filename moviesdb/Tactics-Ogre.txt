Tactics Ogre

 Young knight Alphonse Loeher is sent by the Holis Lodis Empire to the distant, mysterious island of Ovis, along a small army led by his friend Rictor Lasanti, to put an end to ongoing conflicts between the island's locals. However, Alphonse is separated from his troops and takes his own path, which eventually leads to the discovery that the real reason behind the local battles and his army's mission is the search for a long lost artifact, the source of God's seal on a legendary evil.
