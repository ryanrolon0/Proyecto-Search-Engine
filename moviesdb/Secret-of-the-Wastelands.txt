Secret of the Wastelands

 Hoppy is leading a scientific expedition and the Chinese who have a hidden settlement nearby are trying to stop them. Saulters and his outlaw gang are also in the area looking for a gold mine. When Saulters men attack, the gold mine is found. Hoppy agrees to file for the Chinese and heads after Saulters in the chase to the land office. The usual gang of bad guys is out to grab up all the available ranch land. This time their object is land belonging to Chinese. As an aside, Hoppy leads some archaelogists through parts of California.
