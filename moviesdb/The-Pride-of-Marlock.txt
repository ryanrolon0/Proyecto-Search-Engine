The Pride of Marlock

 Dragged down by his job as a Parking Officer, Michael routinely hits his local bar and obliterates himself every night. Until one night, by a case of mistaken identity, Michael is picked for a L.A.R.Per (Live Action Role Player). The minions of the L.A.R.Ping clan Navarro kidnap Michael as they believe he holds the Pride of the Marlock clan. Blackmailed and forced to play along, Michael begins to find himself and the woman to solve all his problems.
