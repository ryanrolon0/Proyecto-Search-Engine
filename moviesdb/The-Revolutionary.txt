The Revolutionary

 The government slowly but surely tightens its grip around the citizens of the nation. A freedom fighter, inspired by the memories of his slain wife, forms a plan to topple the totalitarian regime. The freedom fighter is forced to go to extreme measures to reach the inner structure of the corrupt government. In a head-to-head conflict with a top terrorist interrogator, the freedom fighter challenges his enemies to make choices that will change their lives forever, causing the interrogator to question the foundations of his beliefs.
