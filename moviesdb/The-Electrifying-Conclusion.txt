The Electrifying Conclusion

 A definitive record of one of the greatest live bands in rock ELECTRIFYING CONCLUSION is a chronicle of the last four hours of Guided By Voices. The film captures Guided By Voices' final concert at Chicago's Metro on New Year's Eve 2004 - 63 songs, completely uncut. The excitement and nostalgia from both the band and audience are powerfully captured here in performances of GBV classics and special, seldom-played songs.
