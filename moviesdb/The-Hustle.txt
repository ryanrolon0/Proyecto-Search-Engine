The Hustle

 Disenchanted pest sprayer and single dad Freddie Manning is always trying to hustle a tiny bit more from his disappointing life when he suffers a series of setbacks that puts him in the unlikely position of his biggest hustle yet. It all starts when he falls upon a large sum of mob money, which Freddie and his cynical, naysaying best friend, Junior, lose in a crazy chase through the city. Freddie and Junior are left owing Asian crime boss Toshiba Ohara and his spicy daughter, Han, $10,000 ~ in seven days! The pair don't know what to do until they're mistaken for the Replacement Ministers expected at a struggling, run-down Baptist church during a pest call. They trade their Bug World outfits for minister robes and soon are inspiring the tiny but enthusiastic church into a fevered fundraising campaign. Freddie knows nothing about preaching, but his hilarious, straight-from-the-heart sermons seem to touch people and no one is more surprised than Freddie when his fake healings become real ones. Along the way, the congregation and community are forever changed, but not as much as Freddie and Junior themselves. With fresh, exhilarating performances by a top-notch cast, including Al Shearer, Charlie Murphy, Tamala Jones, Brigitte Nielsen, David Alan Grier and others, The Hustle will warm your soul and tickle your funny bone.
