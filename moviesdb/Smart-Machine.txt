Smart Machine

 During a family vacation, a single-minded little boy has a most unusual encounter with a vending machine. The CG animation, Smart Machine, is the second in an ongoing series of shorts that combine storytelling with advocacy to present healthy food choices to children (and their families). To the child's astonishment, the machine not only can communicate with him, it has some definite ideas on what children should eat.
