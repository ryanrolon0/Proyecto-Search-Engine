The Ruling Passion

 James Alden, a self-made millionaire on the edge of exhaustion, is ordered by his doctor to retire and rest. Rest, however, drives Alden mad with boredom, so he decides to open a garage business, incognito, and work as a simple mechanic on the motors which have always given him such pleasure but for which, as a businessman, he never had time. After a while, even after a tough fight with a competing garage, his "rest" proves very beneficial to his health.
