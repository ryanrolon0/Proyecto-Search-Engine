Rearranged

 A group of soldiers from the year 2305 are sent back in time to alert the world to the presence of an alien species, the Nephti, that arose in 2006 and eventually brought the human race to its knees. With the help of Zita, the first woman with the ability to sense and track the alien race, the soldiers are able to find and fight the Nephti and complete their mission of bringing the existence of the alien presence into the forefront, despite the governments aggressive campaign to cover up their actions.
