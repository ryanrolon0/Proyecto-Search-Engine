Two Fathers' Justice

 On the eve of their wedding day, Karen & Johnny are murdered by drug dealers who are actually after the bridegroom's roommate. The killers are caught, but they jump bail and flee the country, outside the reach of U.S. authorities. The fathers of the victims, Stackhouse, a macho, ex-marine mill worker and Bradley, a priggish, millionaire businessman, vow to bring them back to justice. The unlikely pair undergo commando training in preparation for a raid on the island hide-out of the fugitives.
