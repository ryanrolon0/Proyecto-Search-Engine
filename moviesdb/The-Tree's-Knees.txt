The Tree's Knees

 Bosko is about to cut down a tree when a squirrel pops out of its hole and begs him to spare it. The anthropomorphic tree cowers as little trees gather around to protect it. Everyone is relieved when Bosko pulls a harmonica out of his pocket and plays. Bosko the woodsman will spend his day in the forest playing music instead of cutting down trees. Meanwhile, the trees and animals of the forest dance and make their own music.
