The Melon Heads

 As summer in Ohio draws to a close, four friends prepare to move forward with their lives and take their first steps into adulthood. Griff (Joe Zamora) is about to propose to his girlfriend Riley (Tina Grimm) as his best friend Dean (Robert Miller) debates on ending his relationship with Audrey (Eman Khwaja), who is about to move across the country to start her career. One final night together is spent discussing the far-fetched local legend of "The Melon Heads", and their interest in the matter eventually leads them to the discovery of a viral online video that has surfaced due to internet-celebrity Doug Williams (Sean C. Phillips). Passing the video off as a hoax, little do they know the truth that lies within the footage. Allowing their curiosity to get the best of them, the four come to realize just how real the "legend" of The Melon Heads truly is. When the others go missing, Griff enlists the assistance of his cousin Tony (Roger Conners) to investigate the stretch of road in which The Melon Heads are rumored to be located. There, they too become part of an all too real and all too deadly scenario that will put their lives, as well as the lives of their friends, in grave danger. Every urban legend is inspired by aspects of reality, and the tale of the Melon Heads is no different.
