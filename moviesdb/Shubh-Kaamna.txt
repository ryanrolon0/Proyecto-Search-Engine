Shubh Kaamna

 Ratan (Rakesh Roshan) is a self-styled, and rather compulsive do-gooder. His manner often alienates him from his superiors and bosses, and he often ends up getting fired. He comes across Sujata (Rati Agnihotri) and her family, and finds out that Sujata cannot get married because her father (Sujit Kumar) is not wealthy enough to afford a dowry. Ratan decides to get involved indirectly and secretly arranges Sujata's marriage with Mr. Mehra (Vinod Mehra). But will this land Ratan in trouble all over again? Is this what Sujata and Mr. Mehra really want?
