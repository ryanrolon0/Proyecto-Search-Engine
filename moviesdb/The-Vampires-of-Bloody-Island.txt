The Vampires of Bloody Island

 In a crumbling castle clinging to a rocky, isolated Cornish island, Morticia de'Ath, a vampire noblewoman and her henchman, Grunt, are concocting a sinister plan. Aided by misguided alchemist, Doctor N. Sane, they aim to discover the magical cure for vampires to become immune to the deadly rays of sunlight! However, one essential ingredient remains missing, an ingredient only available from an innocent and unknowing girl living in far away London, Susan Swallows.
