Recollection

 An elderly artist paints a lonely landscape of winding beach and distant cliffs. Suffering a heart attack, he collapses upon his studio floor. A young adventurer explores the autumn wilderness portrayed in the artist's painting. Two distinct moments of a man's life overcome time and distance to briefly connect, revealing death may be as much a journey for the soul as life.
