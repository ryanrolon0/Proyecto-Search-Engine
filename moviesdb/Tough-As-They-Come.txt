Tough As They Come

 This entry in Universal's "Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys" series is minus "The Little Tough Guys" and has only four members of "The Dead End Kids" gang. Consequently, "The Little Tough Guys" are not working for a finance company,and, for that matter, neither are the "Dead End Kids" as a group. Tommy Clark is the only one of the group that includes Pig, aka Albert , Ape and String, gainfully employed in any manner and he is working for a crooked finance company that charges the borrowers 36% interest (compounded) and more, and is constantly repossessing radios, furniture, taxi cabs and anything else the poor people of the slums buy on time payments. Tommy, who went to work for the company because the job paid more than a trainee's job he was offered in the District Attorney's office, finally sees the light and turns "stolen" evidence from the finance company over to the D.A's office.
