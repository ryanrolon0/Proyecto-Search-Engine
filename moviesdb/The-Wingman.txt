The Wingman

 Recently reunited buddies Don & Matt go out for a night on the town like old times. Their plans are foiled somewhat as there's not too much action downtown these days; recent criminal activity has people staying home in fear. At their favorite watering hole, Don & Matt meet Lisa, the new barmaid who just might bring some excitement to their night after all.
