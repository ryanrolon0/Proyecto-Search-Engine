Un americano in vacanza

 Maria (Velentina Cortese) comes to Rome to do what she can to aid the war-stricken people of her village, and meets Dick (Leo Dale), an American soldier in Rome on furlough from the front lines. He is concerned only with winning her companionship, while she tries to keep her mind on the mission that brought her there. They both eventually accomplish their goals, and when he returns to the front, there is a promise that they will be reunited after the war.
