The King Is Born

 The coming of a savior, the Messiah, is foretold by prophets, announced by angles and realized in the birth of Jesus, only to opposed by worldly power in the person of King Herod. The King Is Born dramatically weaves together the key events surrounding the birth of Jesus. It places them in Biblical context, beginning with Simeon's vigil at the temple in Jerusalem to see the Messiah and continuing with the Angel Gabriel's visit to Mary. The search for lodging in Bethlehem introduces a humorous innkeeper and leads to the wondrous event surrounding the birth in a humble stable, including the visit of the shepherds and the journey of the wise men. We visit the royal palace to learn of a very different reaction by King Herod. As Herod's troops ride through Bethlehem, bent on killing every male child, Mary Joseph and the baby Jesus escape to Egypt. The video ends with their return to Nazareth, where a young Jesus works with his father in his carpentry shop, gaining wisdom and special gifts.
