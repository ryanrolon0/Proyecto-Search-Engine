Prehistoric Pink

 The Pink Panther and a short, pointy-nosed caveman are laboring to move a large, rectangular slab of rock across a prehistoric jungle. The Pink Panther realizes that the rock would be easier to move if it were round. So, he and the caveman chisel it into a sphere and roll it down a hill. It picks up speed and flattens the caveman repeatedly as it reaches hill bottom, rises on another hill, then re-descends, again and again. The Pink Panther and the caveman next have the idea of positioning another rectangular slab on a carriage and pulling it, and they invent a pair of wheels to put beneath the carriage. Then, when the panther and caveman envision the future for the wheel, including the Industrial Revolution, automobiles, urban blight, and pollution, they destroy the two wheels and go back to moving the slab by their original, clumsy pushing method.
