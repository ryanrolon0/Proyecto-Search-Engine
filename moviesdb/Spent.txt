Spent

 Spent is a dark stop-motion tableau of chaos, control, and destiny featuring an unlikely cast of puppets. Set to the mantra-like score (by the band Geezer Lake) of a self-help tape from hell, these demons of monotony populate a craggy subterranean purgatory, each driven to its own course of destiny by a fallen charioteer of the apocalypse. When the charioteer's whip becomes entangled in the spokes of his static cycle, the ensuing meltdown results in a flight to the proverbial mountaintop.
