The Columbia-Cornell-Pennsylvania Boat Race at Poughkeepsie

 A great series of pictures illustrating the University boat races. The opening scene shows the launching of the eight-oared shell by the Cornell crew. A fine close picture, showing every muscle of the stalwart oarsmen as they carry their boat down the float, place it in the water and row away for the starting point. The second scene shows the Columbia crew launching their boat. The third scene shows the finish of the race with Cornell crew leading by about three boat lengths. A very pretty marine picture, with hundreds of pleasure boats of all descriptions following in the wake of the racers.
