The Tenderfoot's Round-Up

 The story of the film has to deal primarily with the tenderfoot, but a mother-in-law starts the trouble. Some mothers-in-law are convenient, others are obnoxious. This one was-well it's up to you. She butted in and upbraided her son-in-law for being pinched in a gambling house raid. He, half demented by indignation and shame, left his young wife and his Eastern home and went out to Billy Wither's ranch at Santa Fe. The cowboys made a mark of him until he learned their tricks, and then, they all bore his marks. After several months, a telegram came to him from home. Its contents was startling, and he started away for the train on Billy Wither's horse. The sheriff thought him a horse thief, but the telegram was a passport and he was allowed to ride after the limited, which was just pulling out. He leaped from his saddle to the back platform of the train and was met by the conductor. The telegram again secured his passport and he arrived at his home in all his Western regalia. Bounding up the front steps, he burst into the house and up to his wife's bedroom. The nurse entered, bearing an infant, and the happy tenderfoot's little family was rounded up with no mother-in-law to interfere.
