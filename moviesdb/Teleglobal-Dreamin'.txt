Teleglobal Dreamin'

 During the global recession, Dale, an American sales coach comes to Manila to teach the staff at a call center how to sell up. He mentions that he's learned these survival techniques from his career in sales and from acting in Hollywood. Rosa, a star-struck employee, goes on line, looks Paul up, and finds that he was in a movie with Brendan Fraser. She volunteers to show him around and texts a couple of girlfriends to join them for the afternoon and maybe the night. By accident or on purpose, messages are garbled and some people may think he's Brendan Fraser. What's next?
