The Witches of Eastwick

 An unsold TV series pilot about three single witches living together who try to conjure up their idea of the "perfect man". One day, their wish comes true when a seemingly perfect man named Darryl Van Horne moves into town and sweeps them off their feet by making all their dreams come true. However, they soon realize that "perfect" isn't exactly the best word to describe their devilish new man after strange and unexplainable incidents begin occurring. The pilot was inspired by both John Updike's original novel and the 1987 movie that followed.
