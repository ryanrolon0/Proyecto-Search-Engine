The Bicyclist

 Lester Cribs is losing his restaurant and his wife in the suburbs of Detroit. As his world falls apart, he decides to ...ride away on his bike. The Bicyclist takes you on a journey of discovery as Les tries to relive a dead brother's trip to the Mackinac Bridge fifteen years later. Timmy, Les' brother has left behind a journal of his 1994 trip detailing how a bicycle and a love for people can open any door. Les tries his best to memorialize Timmy on the trip with the help of wise strangers, but cannot escape the desperation of his new calling.
