Unhallowed Ground

 UNHALLOWED GROUND tells the tale of Ben Kaney, a young man who inherits an abandoned hotel and a deserted fairytale land for children. Ben travels to a rural, decaying town to claim his inheritance, only to discover that the townsfolk, all burdened by unusual afflictions, want no part of him and that the land is indeed 'haunted' - thirsting for the blood of it's returning owner. Beware the DHIM-MAHN-BAE-HAE!'
