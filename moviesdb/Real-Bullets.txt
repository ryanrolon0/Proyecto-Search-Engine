Real Bullets

 A group of stuntmen and women travel to the wilderness for a weekend party. Two of the women stumble upon the secret entrance to a drug-lord's narcotics operation and are abducted. Out-gunned and out-numbered, the stunt team must rescue their friends before they are administered fatal overdoses of heroin.
