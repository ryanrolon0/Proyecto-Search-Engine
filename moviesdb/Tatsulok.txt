Tatsulok

 Minda, in her forties, is having a torrid affair with the younger Dave, and is trying to hide it from her husband Chito. Dave is an occasional tattoo artist. He also plays drums in a rock and roll band that has a difficult time finding gigs, now that the US Navy has left Subic Bay. One day Stephanie, a Philippino-American who came to the Philippines on a cultural discovery tour, turns up at Minda's house claiming she is her daughter, whom she gave away for adoption twenty years earlier. Stephanie has questions about her adoption that Minda is unwilling to answer. Dave arrives and takes Stephanie out, much to the annoyance of Minda.
