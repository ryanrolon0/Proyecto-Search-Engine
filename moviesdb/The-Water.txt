The Water

 Father and son bring their painful past into their isolated present for 24 hours. Set in the middle of a cold beautiful winter, "The Water" explores the complex and intimate dynamic between loved ones and loss. "The Water" unfolds with almost no dialogue, like a visual poem, infusing a hermetic world with regret, anticipation, and irrefutable familial love. Set in part to the soundtrack "The Water" by Feist.
