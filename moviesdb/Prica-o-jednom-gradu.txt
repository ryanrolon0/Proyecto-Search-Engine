Prica o jednom gradu

 This is a tale of the creation of the City of Pancevo, a small town in Vojvodina, Serbia, near Belgrade, with 850 years tradition. But, much more then that, it is a tale of the timeless joy of creating and not letting anyone be your guide except yourself. Just like the sunflower in the film, you should not follow the Sun - you should become the Sun instead!
