The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi

 A musical journey through the brief life and times of the celebrated composer who pioneered the crossover of jazz and pop music -- from his celebrated scores for the Peanuts animations, to his mega-hit Cast Your Fate To The Wind, his nights in San Francisco's North Beach at the hungry i, and his ground breaking Jazz Mass at Grace Cathedral. Including recently discovered and restored footage of Guaraldi's appearances and recording sessions (captured by noted jazz writer and Rolling Stone co-founder Ralph J. Gleason), the film features new performances and insights from Dave Brubeck, Dick Gregory, George Winston, Jon Hendricks, Paul Krassner, Paul Mazursky and many more.
