The Snuff Machine

 Michael Findlay loves women. He loves them so much he's turned into a sleazy horrible mess of a man. He finds a hot target in the form of a mysterious girl at a bizarre and almost pathetic bar called the Snuff Machine. When he picks her up with the bare minimum of awful pick up lines, he thinks he's going to be in for an easy screw. His predicted lay turns into a night of horrific torture at the hands of this psychotic lass. Based on horrifying true events.
