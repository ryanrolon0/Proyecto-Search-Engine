Unhung Heroes

 "Unhung Heroes" is a comic fiction about five FTM (female to male) transgendered guys who, after finding an internet article announcing the first actual penis transplants are about to be performed, imagine a scheme to come up with over a million dollars in surgery money. Riffing on influences as diverse as Reservoir Dogs, Busby Berkeley and Peter Berlin movies, this action-packed comedy starts with their experience of life as a 'guy without a dick,' then follows their rosy fantasies of life 'post-transplant,' and the crazy imaginary lengths they go to for the money.
