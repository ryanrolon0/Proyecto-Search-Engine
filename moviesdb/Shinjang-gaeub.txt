Shinjang gaeub

 Life seemed perfect in the little village. There was one of everything. One supermarket, one drugstore, one Chinese restaurant... until a mysterious rival restaurant run by strangers opened next door. Sun-kyoung, his family and his employees soon find themselves with nothing to do as all their customers have gone to the new place. Finally, Sun-kyoung goes to try the competition's food to find out why it's so popular. He finds it to be delicious, but he can't imagine what kind of meat they are using. At least, not at first...
