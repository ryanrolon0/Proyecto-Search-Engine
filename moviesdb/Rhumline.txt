Rhumline

 A group of strangers meet on line then again in Beijing to take on a rhumline challenge through China, Mongolia and Tibet. The rhumline is drawn and they intend to arrive in Kunming in 63 days time. Lost on a glacier, arrested without visas, floods, bribes and corruption are just some of the events that will force deviations to the rhumline. This adventure will enthrall and entertain, captivate and inspire as you are taken on an exciting journey across the Mongolian grasslands, along the old Chinese Silk Road and up to the roof of the world, Tibet. The stunning cinematography is set to an up-beat soundtrack of world music encompassing Buddhist mantras with techno trance, haunting traditional arrangements and inspiring and uplifting new age global beats.
