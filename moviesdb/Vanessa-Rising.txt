Vanessa Rising

 Vanessa needs one thing. To escape from her own head. Doused in depression, escaping herself is the last thing she seems able to do. As the noise inside amplifies, she teeters dangerously on the thin edge of hopelessness. Vanessa faces the challenge to begin to rise above her demons or succumb to her greatest fear...losing herself.
