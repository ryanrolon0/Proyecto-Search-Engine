The Postman Didn't Ring

 A government mail sack, missing for fifty years, is now being delivered. Stamp collector Julie Martin follows postal inspector Brennon on his delivery tour, hoping to find some rare stamps for her philatelist customers. One letter brings love and warmth to a lonely spinster from a sweetheart lost in a war, another a welcome bravery citation to Civil War veteran Slade and a third is to the parents of the now-state governor from his high school principal requesting he be disciplined for throwing spitballs in class. Dan Carter, the owner of the village supply store who extends local farmers unlimited credit and, as a result, is on the verge of foreclosure by the ruthless Harwood banking family, get a letter sent by his grandfather to his father containing 500 shares of stock in the Harwood bank. The Harwood family fights back by charging Dan with fraud, but Judge Colt and Dan's Aunt Martha aid him.
