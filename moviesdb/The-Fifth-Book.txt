The Fifth Book

 Ariel, a recent young widow, comes to the library to return books that her husband had checked out. Each book she returns triggers her memory and sends us back to the past where we learn about their loving yet complex relationship. But there is also a fifth book, that Ariel is unaware of, which reveals a secret about her husband and leads her to an epiphany about death and life.
