Ridin' Thru

 Dad Brooks is in financial trouble and needs to sell a lot of horses. But they are being rustled and needing help, he sends for Tom. Tom looks for the rustlers but eventually realizes that someone is using a wild horse to do the rustling. He finds the secret entrance used by the rustlers to hide the horses but soon finds himself a prisoner. Range detective Tom Saunders and his sidekick Ben are riding along when they spot a white stallion leading a band of mares down the road. They follow until they come to a bend where a roadster is blocking the road. Tom decides to move it but is stopped by Dolores Brooks, the driver who is out on a picnic. They meet her again at her uncle's ranch. Ranch-owner Elmer Brooks has had to turn his spread into a dude-ranch to offset the losses caused by his herd being stolen. He blames the stock-loss on a wild stallion in the hills. Tom thinks the culprit may be human rather than horse, and he and Ben are hired on as ranch-hands.
