The All of It

 On a rainy morning, Father Declan Loughry ponders the recent deathbed confession of one of his parishioners. Kevin Dennehy and his wife, Enda, have been sweetly living a lie for some 50 years, a lie the full extent of which Father Declan learns only when Enda finally confides "the all of it." Her tale of suffering mesmerizes the priest, who recognizes that it is also a tale of sin and scandal, a transgression he cannot ignore. However, as Declan hears the heartbreaking truth behind Kevin and Enda's union he is forced to question his own convictions. Not only must he learn to forgive the unforgivable, but on that journey of discovery, he must also confront his own buried sins and face the toughest challenge of all, forgiving himself. The resolution of his dilemma is a triumph of strength and compassion.
