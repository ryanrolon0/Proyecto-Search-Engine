The Butcher and the Housewife

 The Butcher and the Housewife tells the story of Beverly, an uncherished housewife (Franca Vercelloni), and Pete, a supermarket butcher (Tim Hayes)- two lonely souls looking for love in small town Pennsylvania. Beverly is stuck in a loveless marriage to her vegetarian husband. The only thing she looks forward to each day is going to Ahart's, the local grocery store, where she stocks up on ground beef, bacon and mischievous glances from Pete. Pete stands behind the counter anxiously awaiting Beverly's daily visit. Sadly, he is stuck working with three unbearably immature assistants. The three youngsters find great and consistent humor in interfering with Pete's attempts at love. It is in and around the supermarket that Pete and Beverly finally come together, through their mutual love of the music of the Scorpions.
