The Oil Raider

 "Wildcatter" Dave Warren and his crew are trying to bring in a new oil well. Dave gives troublemaker Simmons a good thrashing and orders him off the site. In order to complete drilling Dave borrows $50,000 from investment banker J. T. Varley and also begins a romance with Varley's daughter Alice. Varley suffers market reverses and knowing that Dave is about to strike oil hires Simmons to wreck the rig so he can foreclose and take over.
