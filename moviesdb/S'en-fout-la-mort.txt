S'en fout la mort

 Natives of Benin and the West Indies, Dah and Jocelyn form a fine team. Dah is convinced that this time, luck smiles on them. They begin working for a restauranteur who organizes clandestine cockfights in the basement of his establishment. Confined all day long in the restaurant's basement, they train their rooster, a future champion named "S'en fout la mort".
