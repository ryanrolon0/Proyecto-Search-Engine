Showboys

 Chaz, a Vintage Showboy Magazine Collector, is gearing up for the Annual Vintage Showboy Magazine Collector's Convention when disaster strikes he and his roommates' apartment. Mr. Berkus, their evil landlord, has had enough and is threatening to throw them out once and for all. After a wild series of events, Chaz must make the decision to either give up his entire precious collection, throwing away any and all chances of winning the first prize trip to the Showboy Palace, or abandon his roommates and forfeit the roof over his head to the evil clutches of Mr. Berkus.
