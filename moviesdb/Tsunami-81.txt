Tsunami 81

 A poignant, journey of the two-orphaned 2004-tsunami victims who subconsciously find a family within their new circumstances. The film narrative is based on the actual locales of South India, Nagapattinam where the tragedy struck. It's in times of such natural disasters and grave crisis that the best of humanity surfaces.
