Rites of Winter

 "Rites of Winter" depicts the volatile relationship between two Greek immigrant brothers living in Florida, and the emotional impact upon their lives of the 1974 Turkish invasion of the Greek Island of Cyprus. The drama examines their struggle to come to terms with prejudice, their lingering feud in the face of a mysterious disappearance, and the quest of a young man, from within their family, who must carve out his own identity within the confines of the culture in which he was raised.
