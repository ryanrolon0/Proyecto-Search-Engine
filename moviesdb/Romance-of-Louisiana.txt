Romance of Louisiana

 This 1937 Vitaphone short was reissued in 1953 to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1803, American President Thomas Jefferson appointed James Monroe to negotiate with Napoleon to acquire the Louisiana territory from France. England's King George urges the United State's to take the territory by force as France is selling the territory only to get more money to fight against England. Napoleon learns of this and promptly sells the territory for $15,000,000 in an early example of a distress sale.
