Tameiki

 A young office worker is going through a bad period. He must do door-to-door sales for his real estate company, but nobody is interested. To top things off, his girlfriend dumps him. The film also shows the frustrations being had by the owner of a small gas station and a thug in an expensive sports car. By chance, the three men, along with the salesman's ex-girlfriend, all meet together in a violent confrontation.
