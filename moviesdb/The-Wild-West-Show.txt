The Wild West Show

 "Rodeo" Bill is a hard-nosed, fun-loving cowboy who likes a lot of action and will go out of his way to create some if things are going too dull to suit him. He attends a circus/wild west show and stirs up some trouble with both the locals and the troupers but, after seeing Ruth Henson, the daughter of the show's operator/owner, he decides to join up and travel with the circus. He also manges to take care of some trouble not of his doing.
