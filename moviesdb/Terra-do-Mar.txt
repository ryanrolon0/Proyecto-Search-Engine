Terra do Mar

 The lives of people who live by the sea, on islands, bays, marshes in the North of the State of Paraná, in Brazil and South of the State of São Paulo. Although relatively close to the big cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, they're basically fishermen who try to live in greater harmony with nature.
