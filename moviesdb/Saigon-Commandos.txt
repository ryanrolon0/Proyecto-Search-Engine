Saigon Commandos

 A series of drug-related murders haunt Saigon. Ex-Green Beret Mark Stryker and his MP's must find the culprits. With the help of Jean Lassiter, a nosey reporter covering the crime beat, Stryker uncovers the involvement of corrupt politicians in the heroin trade and in the killings. But before he can pin them down, Stryker is framed for the murder of his commanding officer and now he must clear his name, free Lassiter from her captors, and stop his men from carrying out their own kind of vengeance before it is too late.
