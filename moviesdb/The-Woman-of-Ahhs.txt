The Woman of Ahhs

 Loosely based on The Wizard of Oz, THE WOMAN OF AHHS is the exhilaratingly unpredictable adventures of Jude Garland - a charming, lovelorn musician who is on a quest to find a mysterious woman whom he has merely glimpsed over the Internet. Light, dark, comedic, and dramatic, THE WOMAN OF AHHS is an insightful, and refreshingly original exploration of romantic love.
