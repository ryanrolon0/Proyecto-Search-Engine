The Twin Lights of the Navesink Highlands

 The Twin Lights of the Navesink Highlands has stood as a sentinel over the treacherous coastal waters of northern New Jersey since 1828. With its two beacons, the Twin Lights saved countless sailors lives, was the ground for Marconi's wireless experiments leading to the cell phones of today, and was the site where the Pledge of Allegiance was first recited in America. Today this historic site houses a museum that enables all visitors to Get Connected to the past, present, and future through its vast history of innovations that took place there. The Twin Lights still stands today as a symbol linking our present and future with the heritage of America's past.
