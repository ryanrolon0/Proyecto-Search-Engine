Powder Town

 Absent-minded professor Quincey Pennant creates a formula to transmit the impact of explosives over greater distances. Hired by the Jupiter Powder Co. to perfect and test the method, he is occasionally sidetracked by gold-digging females and formula-seeking spies. J. Quincy Pennant is hired by a large explosives company to continue his experiments with a new kind of gun powder. At his boarding house he meets Sally Dean, whom he falls in love with instantly, and her roommate, Dolly Smythe, somewhat in love with Jeems O'Shea,one of the workers at the plant, although not to the point of exclusivity. The two girls work at the dancing-drinking-gambling casino run by Clancy Stuart. Many attempts are made to steal Pennant's secret formula but the combined bumbling efforts of the two girls and O'Shea foil all.
