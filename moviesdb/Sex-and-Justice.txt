Sex and Justice

 Sex and Justice is the story of four people ensnared in a complex web of murders and vengeances. It begins with the unorthodox interrogation of a confessed murderess (Elizabeth Fiara) whose interview soon causes new suspicions to form around her interviewer - recently vindicated District Attorney Norman Turner. Turner's corruptions are already well known to Detective Robert Bryant (aka "The Texan,"), but the extent of his partner's (Detective Robert Montgomery) involvement in the entire affair remains a mystery.
