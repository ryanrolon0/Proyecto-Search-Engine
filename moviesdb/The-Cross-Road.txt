The Cross Road

 Salaam (Garen Boyajian), a Syrian teen newly emigrated to the US, meets and falls in love with an American girl named Bridget (Shenae Grimes). Their relationship is soon threatened by Walker, Bridget's father, who has a distrust of foreigners and Arabs in particular. Walker ignites the community and recruits several youths to help him drive "those people" out of the neighborhood. In doing so, he jeopardizes his daughter's happiness and the life of the boy she loves.
