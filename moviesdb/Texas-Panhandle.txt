Texas Panhandle

 Suspended from the Secret Service pending investigation of his rumored activities as the Durango Kid, Steve Buckner (Charles Starrett) heads west to the Texas Panhandle, where he learns renegades have attacked settler wagon trains and have stolen government gold. In Crow Springs, he finds out that Ace Gatlin (Forrest Taylor) is running a land office under suspicious circumstances with Ann Williams (Nanette Parks) innocently serving as his assistant. As the Durango Kid, Steve learns about the fraudulent land swindles and that Gatlin's men stole the gold.
