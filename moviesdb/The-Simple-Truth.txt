The Simple Truth

 This five-hour telethon, produced by Tony Hollingsworth of Tribute, was organised just after the Gulf War, as Kurdish refugees fled to the mountains. The broadcast reached 36 countries and raised $15 million. The main concert was staged at Wembley, with five satellite sites beaming concerts from around the world. The result was the first ever "World Juke Box" allowing artists on tour in the USA, Australia, the Netherlands and the UK to help the Red Cross provide aid to Kurdish refugees.
