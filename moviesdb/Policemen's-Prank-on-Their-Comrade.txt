Policemen's Prank on Their Comrade

 This amusing picture opens by bringing into view a young lady seated on a bench near a park lake. Her policeman lover appears on the scene and begins to caress her in a most affectionate manner, in spite of the sign prohibiting courting in the park. A couple of fellow officers see their comrade breaking the law, and take the law in their own hands by throwing the couple into the lake.
