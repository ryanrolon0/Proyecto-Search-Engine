 Comedy TV pilot, Written and Directed by Tim Croucher and Staring Russell Grant (Astrologer and Actor), Lee MacDonnald (AKA Zammo from Grange Hill), Tim Faraday( Primeval, The Ghost) Mark Kempner and Angus Kennedy.(genie in the house) This comedy is based around Graham, the station officer and his disfunctional ambulance station and crew of paramedic misfits. As far as Graham is concerned he runs a very tight ship and thinks his crews are the best, and in his mind all the crews love him, but deep down all the paramedics can't stand him, and Graham just doesn't realise how disfunctional the crews are and the mis-adventures going on behind his back.
