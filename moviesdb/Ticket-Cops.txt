Ticket Cops

 TICKET COPS is a farcical journey of the Ticket Cops stationed in Queens. These Ticket Cops show up late, give out minimal tickets, and sometimes challenge pedestrians to bizarre contests. Ticket Cops shows that filmmakers do not need a budget to create cinematic life. Moreover, Ticket Cops captured the pure fun of movie making for all involved. The big hope is that a tinge of the great experience making this piece translates to the Big Screen. Ticket Cops focuses on Kenny Danklestein and his desire is to be gangsta; Jamal and his hopes to keep his job and not have to go back to Nigeria; and Johnny Wong and his efforts antagonizing the public. For the first time, you will love getting a Ticket!
