Rocket Baby

 Our hero Rocket Baby lives on Earth but patrols space on his small rocket protecting the Solar System from the strange menace Space Spinach, a sinister alien creature that is made of spinach and wants to force the Earth's children to eat their spinach. Rocket Baby uses his repulsor beam on his rocket to protect his friends like Space Cookie from Space Spinach, and repel him away from Earth. Rocket Baby's father, Rocket Daddy, is always near by watching him should he ever need any help defeating the Space Spinach.
