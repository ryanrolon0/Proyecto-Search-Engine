Söhne

 The sons of Elizabeth Paetzold reveal, little by little, what they have in common. And their story is a real, living history lesson of Pomerania - throughout history inhabited by Kashubians, Germans & Poles. Over twenty years had to pass before their true identities were confirmed. All the sons were born in the Paetzold family country manor - a formerly German area of Pomerania, near Danzig, which became Polish again & definitely-so after mid 1945, just 9 months after the last of the brothers was born. Elizabeth could only take 2 of the children out of the area before the Red Army took over. The other children remained in Polish orphanages, 2 of them adopted by Polish families. During this meeting, what the brothers call their "last reunion" - the eldest was born in 1938 & the youngest in late 1944, interviews with all the sons, their wives, partner, children, in-laws & neighbors participate, in telling this wonderful family saga, which is the mirror image of post-WWII Pomerania, or even the post WWII Polish-German relationship as a whole.
