Southbound Duckling

 Jerry's little duckling friend has packed his bag and is all set to fly south for the winter despite the book Jerry keeps showing him that points out that domestic ducks do not fly south, and despite his obvious inability to fly at all. But that doesn't stop him from ending up in Tom's frying pan, at least briefly.
