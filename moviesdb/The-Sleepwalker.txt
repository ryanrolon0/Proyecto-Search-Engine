The Sleepwalker

 Damon, an aspiring writer, leads a normal life until his room-mate, a habitual sleepwalker, lets him in on a secret... Damon will be murdered by Sunday. Now, Damon must decide if this is all some kind of sick joke or is his life truly in danger? This could be the story Damon has been searching for. His own. The only problem is... he has to live to tell it.
