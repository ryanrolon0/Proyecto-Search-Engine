Under Lanesfield

 Through the eyes of burnt-out DEA agent Jeff Wright, Under Lanesfield exposes the latest drug epidemic to strike America - methamphetamine. After botching a major drug bust, Wright is packed off to rural Lanesfield, Kansas, to train the local sheriff's office to combat underground meth production. Annoyed with his small-town surroundings, Wright figures he'll throw a few facts at the hayseed locals, flash his badge, and retreat to the glamour of DC and headliner arrests. But the scourge of meth he uncovers in Lanesfield runs deeper than he imagined; as he risks his life to heal one ravaged town, Jeff Wright also discovers the key to his own redemption.
