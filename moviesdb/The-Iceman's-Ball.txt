The Iceman's Ball

 After Clark & McCullough are arrested for disturbing the peace, they purloin the patrol car, but rather than use the hot wheels to escape, they promptly return the car to the police station. After hanging about the station, the new commissioner comes to believe that they really are cops. Given back the very patrol car they stole in the first place, the new blues take to the streets. However, while out on their new beat, the faux policemen are more interested in tracking down women than criminals. Ironically, this was the professional focus of the policemen from whom they stole the patrol car in the first place, so Clark & McCullough adapt themselves nicely to the role of lawmen.
