Under the Bridge

 Under The Bridge is a must see observational documentary on Mexican-American identity that challenges audiences to think about immigration in a whole new way. Telling the story of San Diego's Chicano Park which is situated in the heart of one of America's oldest Mexican communities, this unique film reveals a cultural revolution that has refused to go away. Chicano Park was created in 1970 when residents of Barrio Logan objected to the building of a Highway Patrol Substation in their neighborhood. They had been promised a park on that land, under the bridge. They demanded justice and they got it.
