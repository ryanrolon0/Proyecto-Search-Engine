The Gallant Blade

 1648. French people are relieved will be able to live in peace. This feeling is shared by General Cadeau, the hero of the war, and his loyal aide, Lieutenant David Picard. But not at all by Marshall of France Mordore, who plans to plunder Spain. Cadeau decides to try to dissuade Mordore from implementing his plan but before meeting him he presents David with his sword dubbed "the gallant blade". This wonderful arm as well as David's talent as a swordsman will come handy as Mordore not only will not hear of peace but will prove treacherous as well. Lieut. David Picard, young officer of peasant stock, is the greatest swordsman in 1648 France, and completely devoted to France's hero, General Cadeau, who has victoriously concluded a long and terrible war which has bled the country dry. But before he can deliver a farewell speech to his troops, he is ordered by Marshal Mardore, head of the government, to march on Spain. Taking Picard with him, the General heads for Paris in an attempt to halt this disastrous move. En route, Picard goes to the rescue of the beautiful Nanon de Lartiguws, who, unknown to him, is the sweetheart and ganet of Mordore.
