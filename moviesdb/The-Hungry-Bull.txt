The Hungry Bull

 The Hungry Bull is an off beat, whiskey-soaked comedy that chronicles the misadventures of a lovable pair of misfits searching in vain for love and the perfect fish fry. Phred, a wayward ice cream man, spends most of his time hitting the bars and chasing women, but soon reconnects with Katherine, an old flame caught in a dead end relationship. As Phred attempts to woo Katherine, he befriends an affable old booze hound named Dante, who's been mourning the death of his wife. The Hungry Bull ponders the "Peter-Pan-in-reverse" question, following this cast of wounded malcontents as they seek redemption in the midst of their pedestrian surroundings
