Rapunzel

 A ground breaking short ballet film presenting a fusion of traditional ballet and cutting edge digital technology, utilizing the state of the art Red One Hi definition Digital camera, the first digital movie cameras that match the detail and richness of analog film. 'This is not ballet filmed as if you are watching it in the theater. It is not a replacement for a live performance. It is cinematic. We have maintained the fairytale element of the Brothers Grimm story Rapunzel, whilst creating something beautiful and unique.' Pietra Mello-Pittman, Director
