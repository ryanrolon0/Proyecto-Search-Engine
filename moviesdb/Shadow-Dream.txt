Shadow Dream

 There is a shadow world somewhere between life and death where all sleep but the lost soul looking for their true love. Gregoire died before she realized Gregoire was her true love. When Gisele dies and passes over into the shadow world, she has one last chance to prove that she and Gregoire are true soul mates. A surreal fairytale of life, death and true love.
