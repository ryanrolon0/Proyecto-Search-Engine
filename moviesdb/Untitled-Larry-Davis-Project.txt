Untitled Larry Davis Project

 A drama based on the life of Larry Davis, a New Yorker who, at the age of 19, wounded six police officers in a gun battle and escaped despite being shot in the head. After a 17-day manhunt, Davis turned himself in after getting the feds to promise to investigate police corruption in his neighborhood.
