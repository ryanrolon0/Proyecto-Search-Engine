The Studebakers

 A "Leave It To Beaver" 1950's family plays their favorite American Real Estate board game. Money Please! In an absurd twist, the game play begins to reflect the reality of the real estate market, and the characters are pushed into lives of crime, sex and violence, where only the fittest survive. The Studebaker family starts in a perfect American world, and as the epitome of American culture sits down to play a real estate board game (very similar to one we all know and love), actual economic issues penetrate the game play. Jewelry has to be hocked to buy groceries, rents go through the roof, there's a mortgage crisis, there's a government bail out, and credit cards have 29.97%interest rates! By the end of the game the Studebakers have moved from 1950 to 2008. Mom is selling herself to the banker to buy groceries, daughter Sarah has become a heartless Wall St. power broker, little Timmy has become a gang lord, and Dad just can't take it anymore!
