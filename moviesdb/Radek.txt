Radek

 Radek Peda is 25 years old, ex-convict, former drug dealer and thief. Coping with his aggressions is a heavy duty when nearly everything else has gone out the window, and especially since the relationship with his father and girlfriend are not pushing him in the right direction. A documentary shot in Lodz, Poland.
