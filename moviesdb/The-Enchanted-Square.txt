The Enchanted Square

 In this Paramount Noveltoon (production number P6-3) Police Officer Flanagan gives a little blind girl, Billie, a Raggety-Ann doll, and she is told she can see it if she uses her imagination; she does so and the slum neighborhood is transformed into an enchanted fairyland, alive with beautiful colors and music.
