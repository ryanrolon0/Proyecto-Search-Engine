Sequestro

 During four years a film crew followed the convert operations of the Sao Paulo Anti Kidnap Police Force, an elite group formed of only a handful of men. Kidnappers, victims, police, all intertwine in a action based documentary. Never before seen footage of police work, and stories never heard before of the horror of captivity are shown for the first time.
