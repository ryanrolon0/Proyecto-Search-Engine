The Candid Kid

 Singer Josephine Huston is featured as a member of a Candid Camera Club. The club stages a contest, in which each member is assigned to go out and get some difficult and unusual picture. Josephine's assignment is to get a picture of herself singing in a gondola. The story allows for the introduction of several specialty acts---the Gae Foster Girls, the Anthony Morelli Sextette --- as the contestants visit several night clubs. Josephine gets her picture and wins first prize when a friend breaks a department store window, that has a gondola on display, and she goes through the window to sit in the gondola.
