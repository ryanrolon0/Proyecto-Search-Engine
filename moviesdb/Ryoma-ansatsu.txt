Ryoma ansatsu

 Story of the last three days in the life of Sakamoto Ryoma (1836-1867), imperial loyalist who tried to unite the Choshu and Satsuma clans and prepared the way for the Meiji Restoration (1868). A samurai film in an ironic almost burlesque style, but not without affection for its hero.
