Street of Shadows

 An entry in RKO's "This is America" series that served as the replacement for "The March of Time" series that had been moved to 20th Century-Fox distribution by Time/Life. Ths film concentrates on life in NYC's Bowery where the elevated railway made streets with shadows. The camera takes a trip to New York's lower East Side with looks at Chinatown, Cooper Union, Bridal Row, Fulton's Fish Market, St. Marks and diamond row. The work done by the Bowery Mission, the Boys Club and the Salvation Army is also shown.
