The Skeleton at the Feast

 "Two men and two girls in gay evening clothes are dining together with much merriment. Wine is flowing freely. Suddenly a skeleton appears, advancing slowly through the air. It walks upon the table, and points a warning finger at the quartette, who are filled with consternation. One of the girls faints."
