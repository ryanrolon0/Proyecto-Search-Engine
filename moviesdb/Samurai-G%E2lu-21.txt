Samurai Gâlu 21

 Hagakure Makoto, young and cute, is trying to find a regular job to help support her family. She has no training in the real world, and she will meet with several corporate evils. But she was trained as a samurai by her grandfather, which will be useful to battle the evils of the world, including a bad samurai girl who is protected by an impenetrable net armor - with a week spot, like Achilles' heel. Eventually, it will come the time Makoto must leave this world - passing her skills into another young and cute girl.
