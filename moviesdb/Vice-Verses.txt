Vice Verses

 We did this for the NYC Midnight international short film competition. It required the submissions be no longer than 10 minutes and they had to be completed in only two weeks. There were many different genres and topics given to the different teams of filmmakers from around the world who entered, and we fell into the group who were assigned the genre of "musical" and the topic of "diet(s)." So we had two weeks to make a musical about diets and Vice Verses is what we came up with. AWARDS Vice Verses won honors within its genre for Best Editing; Best Musical Composition; The Audience Choice Award In addition, it received honors for example of a true collaboration. The VPF team came together under the tightest of deadlines to produce a short film within the extremely unusual and narrow scope of the competition, to all but sweep the awards within our genre and come home with the honors for a very respectable 3rd place overall win.
