River of Victory

 Three American filmmakers, fluent in the Cambodian language, explore the complex love-hate relationship between Sang Ly, a young Cambodian mother, and the city dump where she lives. While the dump provides her with a source of income, it's killing her son. Ironically, the dump's name, Stung Mean Chey, means River of Victory. After failing at numerous attempts to heal her son, Sang Ly journeys to her homeland to seek the help of a traditional Cambodian healer. The filmmakers document Sang Ly's successes and failures as she struggles to save her son. In doing so, the dump's name proves to be more prophetic than anyone had ever considered. Is it possible that the dump truly is a place of victory?
