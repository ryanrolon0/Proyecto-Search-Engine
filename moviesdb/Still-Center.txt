Still Center

 Erie, a philosophical unmarried woman in Romania, learns that she is pregnant with triplets. She ponders her options and the future during encounters with her traditional mother, her mercurial boyfriend, her pragmatic doctor, a playful neighborhood girl, a cynical older woman, and the local fortune tellers. A young woman and her boyfriend wrestle with whether she should terminate her pregnancy. Erie, who has a philosophical bent, talks with her mother, visits the clinic and quizzes the doctor, listens to a middle-aged woman in the waiting room, plays hopscotch with Laura a neighbor child, and visits the flat of a woman rumored to tell the future. She sits with Nick, her boyfriend. Has she stated her problem well? A goat stands in the hopscotch spiral thinking it is in the center of the universe.
