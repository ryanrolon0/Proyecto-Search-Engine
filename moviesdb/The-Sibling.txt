The Sibling

 A 12 year old boy who has the ability to convert anyone into a Christian - criminals, Jews, homosexuals - asks God to give him a challenge. A real challenge. Two things occur. 1) The boy comes home from camping with his parents and notices strange footage that was recorded in his camera. Footage that suggests encounters with extraterrestrial life. 2) A bully appears at his school out of nowhere, terrorizing his friends and teachers. This boy claims he is a Christian and thus cannot be converted. The boy, for the first time, faces a person he cannot convert. 'The Sibling' follows the boy's journey as these two events dovetail to a terrifying conclusion about the boy's faith, deeply unforeseen.
