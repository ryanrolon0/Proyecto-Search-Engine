Rush of Fear

 Vin, John 'J.J.' Gillis and Carl steal a 50-carat diamond from De Beers and smuggle it trough customs in a cosmetics jar, but the makeup-bag gets lost in Carly's makeup-bag -she didn't know- in the rental Pontiac, which is rented by the time they find out by lawyer Jack McGuire who took his wife Alex along for a bonding weekend, after marital problems, to a coast hotel in Glen Cove. Gillis is shot after kidnapping Jack, the other two crooks demand the bag -trough a misunderstanding locked up in hotel custody- as ransom from Alex, who teams up with former dot.com manager Sam Bryant, the hunky, gallant client her husband was to meet there, while sheriff Lathrop believes they are probably criminals themselves... A vacation turns into a nightmare when Alex's husband is kidnapped by ruthless diamond thieves. With no help from the local police, Alex is forced to rescue Jack herself - that is until she teams up with stranger, Sam. Together they discover the kidnapping motive left a stolen 50-carat diamond in her possession.
