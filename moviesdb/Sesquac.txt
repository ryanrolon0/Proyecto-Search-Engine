Sesquac

 Being a Sasquatch can't be easy. It's a busy life. Day to day nuisances like paparazzi, or so called TV "animal experts" dressed as bananas keep trying to bring light to your personal situation, you barely have time to skateboard and swim and club it up and do your Sasquatch-y things. It's bad enough these TV people won't leave you alone, but when you borrow a cell phone off of one of the crew members from the animal show trying to expose your life, you get the guy's pesky wife after you. It's a lose/lose situation for a Sasquatch who would rather just be left alone; or is it?
