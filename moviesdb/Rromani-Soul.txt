Rromani Soul

 The film traces the true origin of Rroma people. Through rituals, songs and dance, we follow "Queen of the Gypsies" Esma Redzepova to Macedonia, South of France and finally to India where Rroma linguist Marcel Courthiade reveals for the first time that Kannauj in Uttar Pardesh is the true and unique origin of all Rroma people.
