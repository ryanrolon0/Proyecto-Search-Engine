Radio Daze

 The amazing story of a Radio-addict, the queen of music trivia, Rebbeca De Solarsky. Her home is decorated with knitted pictures, porcelain dolls and plastic flowers. At night, when she goes out "clubbing" she wears lace-gloves and dazzling neck-ties. A true portrait from the decaying inner-city of Tel Aviv.
