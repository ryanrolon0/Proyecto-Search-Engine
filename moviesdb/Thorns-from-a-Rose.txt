Thorns from a Rose

 When a group of young adults convene to celebrate a friend's documentary on mental health care, they have no idea that their past would return to haunt them. On the day of a doctor's retirement, his severely traumatized mental patient, Robert Rose, escapes from his facility, fully determined to seek his version of justice upon the doctor who improperly diagnosed him and provided him with substandard care. On this journey he encounters his former "fellow" inmates, now convening to herald their friend's accomplishment. The journey of Robert Rose leaves behind a path of blood and bodies and his determination to seek full retribution terrorizes a peaceful gathering in a small Arizona town, much to the chargin of the local sheriff.
