The Thief Lord

 A tale about two young boys, Prosper and Bo, who flee to Venice after being orphaned and dumped in the care of a cruel auntie. Hiding in the canals and alleyways of the city, the boys are befriended by a gang of young urchins and their enigmatic leader, the Thief Lord. From their home base of an old cinema theater, the children steal from the rich to support themselves and soon capture the interest of a bumbling detective. However, a greater threat to the children is something from a forgotten past-- a beautiful magical treasure with the power to spin time itself... This tale follows six-year-old Bo and fifteen-year-old Prosper, two recently orphaned brothers who escape their impending separation by running off to Venice. There they have fantastical adventures with the mysterious masked figure known as the Thief Lord and his band of child followers, who show the boys all the magic the city has to offer.
