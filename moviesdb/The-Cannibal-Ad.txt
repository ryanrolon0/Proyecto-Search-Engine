The Cannibal Ad

 Inspired by events that took place in Germany beginning in 2001, this film tells the story of what happens when a lonely but innocent young man posts an ad for someone willing to be cannibalized. He ends up meeting two people who might turn out to be the first real friends he's ever had. But are they good enough friends to eat?
