Saturday's

 "Saturday's" is the unaired pilot for a romantic anthology series on ABC. It was partially re-shot as the premiere episode of "Jack's Place" and aired as a mid-season replacement. The new program had a greater emphasis on comedy and a different principal cast, though footage of the guest stars was kept intact.
