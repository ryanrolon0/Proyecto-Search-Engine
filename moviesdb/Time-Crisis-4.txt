Time Crisis 4

 When Giorgio Bruno and Evan Bernard, two next-generation VSSE agents, were sent to the San Francisco International Airport to investigate a series of weapons trafficking events among terrorist groups inside the United States, all they find is an empty airport, their involvement being leaked for an unknown reason, and finding themselves attacked by a mysterious band of insect-like creatures. When William Rush rescues Giorgio and Evan from harm, he extracts the VSSE agents away from the airport with the help of Elizabeth Conway and explains much of what the VSSE agents were up to prior to meeting up with him. As Giorgio, Evan, and Rush travel around San Francisco to pursue the terrorists and prevent the weapons trafficking/smuggling deal from occurring, soon they all discover that the high-level atrocity isn't what it was thought to be and realized that they were duped for a certain reason. One thing is for sure--this weapon theft crime must be suppressed and hidden agendas, whatever it may be, must also be suppressed. Can Giorgio, Evan, Rush, and Beth investigate the source of the weapons theft crime and protect the security of the United States?
