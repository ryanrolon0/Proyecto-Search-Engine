The Stubborn Cowboy

 A young schoolboy gives his class report on a typical TV western, which is complete with an Indian attack, a crooked poker game, a barroom brawl and an obligatory romance. But for the boy, there's more to the story commercials. The real story, according to him, is the cowboy-hero's refusal to listen to the advice of his "friends." A spokesman announces to his friends that they should smoke Triboro cigarettes. But the stubborn cowboy rolls his own. A friendly banker advises his friends to take out a friendly loan at his friendly bank. But the cowboy just punches all the dishonest card players and takes all their money. Animated child-like drawings tell the boy's skewed, but sharp-eyed, tale.
