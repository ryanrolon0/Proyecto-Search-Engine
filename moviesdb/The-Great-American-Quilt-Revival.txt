The Great American Quilt Revival

 The Great American Quilt Revival is the story of how quilts came to be recognized as works of art and how the craft of quilting has exploded into popular culture. Notable quilter, Georgia Bonesteel, and many of today's well known quilters, historians and collectors discuss their art and their role in the revolution of modern quilting. From early quilting innovator Marie Webster, to the work and influence of the Amish and African-American traditions, to the overwhelming response of quilts mourning the 9/11 tragedies, The Great American Quilt Revival captures the story of this landmark movement.
