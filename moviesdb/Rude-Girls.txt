 Fourteen-year old Sherry and her friend Rachel are enjoying one of their favourite leisure activities population. Best mates D and Stacy cruise their Dagenham 'hood, on the lookout for the next car to steal Morgan Matthews' revelatory film starts as an examination of girl gangs but evolves into an illuminating exploration of adolescence and the many factors underlying these troubled girls' behaviour. We delve into the personal stories and motivations of the girls as they enter young adulthood. Here, father figures are notably absent, and mothers often have only tenuous control over their daughters' lives.

This insightful, shocking and often funny film highlights the difficulties of growing up female in a world of criminal behaviour, meaningless violence and exclusion.
