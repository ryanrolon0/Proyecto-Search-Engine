The Portent

 Dr. Ben Fisher killed his wife. At least, he's convinced that he did. The night before her open-heart surgery, he had an epiphany... the surgery would go well but Rachel would never come out of the anesthesia. Ben wasn't a 'miracle man'. He refused to believe he was being helped to make the right choice and went ahead with the surgery. His ignorance cost him his wife. Six months after the tragedy, it happens again. A guilt-ridden Ben forebodes the brutal murder of a famous novelist, Graham Shapiro on Halloween. Driven to redeem himself, Ben has six days to warn Graham, identify the murderer and stop the killing. But first, he must answer a question. Why does he get the privilege of knowing about things before they happen?
