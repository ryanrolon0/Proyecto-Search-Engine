The Shadow Man

 Homeless, destitute and forgotten, War Veteran and unwitting father Joseph Gray is plucked from the streets by a wealthy and shady Japanese business man. As repayment for his new master's kindness, Joseph must take care of the dirty work that results from his new masters criminal enterprises. For Joseph, killing was always easy, until he is confronted with the realization that he is not only expendable, but that his beloved master Aniki has set in motion an act of betrayal that will shake Joseph's sense of trust, loyalty and family to his core, with violent and tragic consequences.
