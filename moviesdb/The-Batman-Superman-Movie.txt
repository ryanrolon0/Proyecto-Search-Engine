The Batman Superman Movie

 Joker, short on money for his criminal endeavors, strikes a deal with Lex Luthor to kill Superman. Batman tracks Joker to Metropolis and alerts Superman to the Joker's plan. After initial distrust of each other, the World's Finest team up to thwart the villains by night. By day, Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent clash over the attention of Lois Lane. It is a World's Finest Team-up. The Joker, hatching a new scheme with Lex Luthor to destroy the Man of Steel, while the Dark Knight Detective in pursuit of stopping them. Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, on the other hand, are fighting for the attention of Daily Planet's star reporter Lois Lane with another journalist, who also happens to be another hero in cape... Strapped for cash, the Joker offers his services to multi-billionaire Lex Luthor by saying he can kill Superman with his new Kryptonite statue. Trouble is, not only is the Joker an untrustworthy criminal lunatic, but he can never get too far away from Batman. And so Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent meet, in and out of costume, each one wary of the other but no where nearly as explosive as when Luthor and the clown get on each other's nerves. To say nothing of henchwomen in hand-to-hand combat and a battle royale with killer robots. Oh, and Bruce dates some reporter named Lois...
