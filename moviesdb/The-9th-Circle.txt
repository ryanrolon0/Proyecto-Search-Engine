The 9th Circle

 The ninth circle of Hell is where things can't get worse, the center of treachery. On Halloween, at about four in the afternoon, a young woman enters the waiting room of the Realmsville train station, pulls a book from her backpack, and starts to read. She's alone. A clown enters, honks a toy horn, and begins to bother her. He offers her a plastic flower, and, as we hear the noise of her train pulling in to the station, her nightmare begins. Can she escape?
