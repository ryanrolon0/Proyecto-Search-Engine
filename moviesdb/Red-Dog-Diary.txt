Red Dog Diary

 On June 30th, 2005 our 8 year old Golden Retriever, Raja, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). Over the next 8 months, we documented the fight for his life. This documentary is a tribute to Raja's love for life and an effort to help others understand this horrible disease.
