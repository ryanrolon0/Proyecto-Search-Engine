The Unquiet Mind

 The Unquiet Mind was made from video I shot while on a backpacking trip through Yosemite. It explores the idea that busy and desirous thoughts stand between me and what is present all around me. It is impossible to truly see nature while a constant stream of thoughts and ideas flow like a never-ending river through my consciousness. Only when this stream of thoughts is quieted does what is present come into being and live within me. Broken unbroken. Whole separate. Integrated disintegrated.
