Sizzzors

 A short cringing, music pumped documentary capturing the suffering, empowering, skin drilling ritual of engraving your rib cage with ink. An observation of the the needlepoint line between pleasure and pain of the common self-mutilation practice of tattooing. Every mark has its meaning so brand your own.
