Running Without Sound

 At a Los Angeles high school, Sean, who's deaf, runs cross country. He's the victim of some locker-room teasing that a teammate, Derek, puts an end to. In a stab at friendship, Sean stops by Derek's apartment to invite him to run with him; Derek invites him in. They communicate writing notes, and not everything goes smoothly. Then Sean and Derek exchange a glance in which Sean discloses his attraction to Derek. How will Derek respond? What can come of this?
