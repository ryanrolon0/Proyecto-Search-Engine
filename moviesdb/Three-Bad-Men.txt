Three Bad Men

 Bank robbers and best friends Frame, Luther, and Matt forego safe haven in Colorado to save a women from Dutch Henry and his gang. Meanwhile a possie is formed to track them down and return all the money they stole from a small towns bank. Frame Johnsons choice between money and morality may get him and his best friends killed. Three bad men rob a bank and with a posse hot on their trail head for the Colorado border. A mile from the border they find a man who has been shot and his wife of one day kidnapped by a gang of outlaws. With his last, dying gasp the man begs the men to get his wife back. With the posse bearing down on them the men must make a perilous decision-risk their lives to save the dead man's wife-or flee to safety in Colorado.
