Reflektioner i ett torn

 In the documentary we consecutively follow from idea to realization how the Finnish glass sculpture Hans-Christian Berg creates a large sphere made out of hand-blown parabolic mirrors for an exhibition in a medieval castle on an island in the Swedish archipelago. In this fast-paced and jazz mooded film we encounter the inspiration, anguish and honest devotion of an artist who is working towards fulfillment of his dreams. Eventually we learn how a well-designed and intelligently placed glass sculpture can even reflect the continuous paranoia of mankind.
