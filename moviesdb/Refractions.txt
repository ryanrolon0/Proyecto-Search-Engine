Refractions

 An experimental dance film that translates refractive light and sound into human movement and emotion. The dancer explores the depths of the human spirit and the creative process as he interacts with the decaying warehouse around him. A dance film in three acts, explores the depths of the human spirit and the creative process through translating refractive light into movement and emotion. Refractions navigates human vulnerability and resilience through the movements of a solo dancer - Jonathan Turcotte - both choreographer and improviser. He dances among massive columns and magnificent open spaces in an old warehouse in MontrEal's St. Henri neighbourhood, and interacts with animated objects and patterns of light waves inspired by Isaac Newton's illustrations of light. Excerpts from Rainer Maria Rilke's text have informed the audio composition.
