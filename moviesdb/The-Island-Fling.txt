The Island Fling

 Bluto is Robinson Crusoe; Popeye and Olive approach his island on a raft. This is Bluto's excuse to break out the romance his "Hope" chest (next to the "Crosby" chest) and lays out a feast. But Olive is more interested in the food than the woo, and Popeye keeps getting in the way. Bluto tries sending him on some fool's errands. First, he decks Popeye out as a hunter, but Popeye returns with a lion, tiger, elephant, and a sea monster. Next, he starts Popeye digging for a phony treasure, then buries him in rocks, but Popeye surfaces with a chest full of gold coins. Bluto's had enough; he stuff Popeye in the chest, mashes it flat, and tosses it in the alligator pit. Olive's screams get Popeye's attention; he eats the spinach and bursts out. He socks Bluto into the gorilla's lair, where he finds himself chased by an eager female gorilla.
