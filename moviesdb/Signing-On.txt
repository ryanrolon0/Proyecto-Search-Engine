Signing On

 The film's title, a play on words for people whose language is American Sign Language, is about a group of Deaf breast cancer survivors (the Pink Deafies) who struggle with communication in the hearing-dominated, health-care system, where patient/provider communication can mean life or death. The film provides a glimpse into the diversity within the Deaf community through the stories of five women and follows the inspiring story of Anita, a two-time cancer survivor and founder of the only support group for Deaf women in the country. During filming, Anita and her family unexpectedly learn the real truth of her prognosis some 25 years ago and also must face the realities of a previously unknown genetic mutation that will change their lives forever.
