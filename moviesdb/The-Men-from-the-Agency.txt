The Men from the Agency

 In the 1960s, three men, all of them social outsiders, met in the basement of a London advertising agency. David Puttnam, Alan Parker and Charles Saatchi all worked for the agency that revolutionised British advertising - Collett, Dickenson, Pearce. When they started there, advertising was not seen as a respectable job. Thanks to Colletts, it turned itself into one of the most glamorous industries in Britain and the men themselves became the ultimate insiders. The Men from the Agency is a detailed examination of what made this trio of admen as influential as they were; and how they went on to change the face of British politics, film and art, through the lessons they learned in advertising. Contributors include David Puttnam, Alan Parker, Ridley and Tony Scott, Frank Lowe, Tim Bell and John Hegarty.
