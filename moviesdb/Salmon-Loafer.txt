Salmon Loafer

 Chilly Willy goes deep sea fishing coming up with an old shoe which he proceeds to cook. Smedley explains normally he would be stealing fish from his salmon cannery but the salmon aren't running... until now. As Smedley gets to work catching and canning fish, Chilly gets to work stealing it despite Smedley's efforts to keep the pest out. Eventually, Smedley swallows a magnet Chilly was using and has a narrow escape with a meat cleaver. He throws the magnet to the ocean's bottom but, alas, the magnet attracts all the cans of salmon which go with it. So Smedley and Chilly decide to go with the shoe.
