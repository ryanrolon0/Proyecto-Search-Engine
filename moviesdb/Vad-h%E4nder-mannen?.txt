Vad händer mannen?

 A seemingly conventional story. Two lonely people meet by chance one night and find love and friendship, despite their enormous differences. But it's also a story that broadens the picture of what it means to be male and what it means to be female. The story revolves mostly around the young hip-hopper Benne's development towards the eventual release of all the unmanliness he carries within himself, but also about the business woman Ann, who is an alternative to the images of women we are constantly see today. Surely there must be caring and neurotic dads who still loves beer and ice hockey; responsible leaders who are terrified of spiders, nurses with authority and humor, or why not hip hoppers that cry.
