River's Crossing

 15 years after the death of their parents, Abigail is now living with her older sister Lydia. Odelia and Hugo were invited and flown in to train and fight in a local gym. Barber is a brawler, as well as a drummer in a band fronted by Stardust. These are lives crossing paths and media's within a story, told in an unusual manner.
