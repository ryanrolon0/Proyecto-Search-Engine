 1923 opened Shea Stadium. 2009 costly new ones, the latest examples of a disturbing trend record-breakingly expensive stadiums gifted to privately owned teams with the help of billions of dollars in public money. 2012 team plans to move from New Jersey to Brooklyn, where they will occupy the forthcoming Barclays Center. Everyone is building stadiums and taxpayers are left holding the bill. Filmed on location in the South Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn, Stadium Status is an investigative documentary that looks at the new Yankees, Mets, and Nets stadiums and what their actual cost is to a city in the middle of a recession.
