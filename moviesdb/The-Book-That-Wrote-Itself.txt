The Book That Wrote Itself

 Vincent Macken has wriiten his magnus Opus but nobody will publish it. To prove to the publishers and his detractors that his novel is great, he decides to live out the story of his novel. He hires a filmmaker to help him document his experiences on video. When he has documented most of his novel on video, he decides maybe it should be a movie instead.
