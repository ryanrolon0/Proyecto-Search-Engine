Summer of '63

 Two teenage couples decide to double date and go swimming. From that innocent beginning, a series of unfortunate (and entirely implausible) circumstances result in the boys having an argument with their girlfriends, picking up two prostitutes, getting syphilis, giving it to their girlfriends, breaking up with the girlfriends, getting together with each other's ex-girlfriend, they all give each other syphilis, they get cured, one of them becomes a doctor and narrates this film.
