Snowfire

 A little girl living on an isolated ranch claims to have formed a bond of friendship with a pure white, "wild" stallion. The horse is well known in the area, almost legendary, and supposedly vicious. Is she just making it up, or is she telling the truth? If it's real, isn't it dangerous for her with a "killer" horse? Or is the horse as vicious as he's been portrayed?
