Recon 2022

 After the gruesome events on Caprini, Sharp and his elite team of tough, witty and trigger happy space Marines must now head out to the icy planet Mezzo to investigate further Ma'har activities. What they will encounter will defy their imaginations as they tackle giant man eating snow worms, an underground city of Cyborgs, a slew of murderous alien entities and maybe, finally, the ever elusive Ma'hars.
