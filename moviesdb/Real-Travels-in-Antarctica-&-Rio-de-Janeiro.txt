Real Travels in Antarctica & Rio de Janeiro

 Start with spectacular fireworks in Rio, a cascade of light along the Copacabana. Feel the mists of Sugarloaf Mountain. Then go south into the swells of the Drake Passage -- but we spare you the seasickness. Get up close and personal with Gentoo penguins, plus Adelie, and Chinstrap penguins, many with their newborn chicks. See shy Weddel seals, Leopard seals, Crab-eater seals, and noisy Elephant seals. Touch glittering icebergs, and feel the chill of the Katabatic winds. All from the comfort of your own couch!
