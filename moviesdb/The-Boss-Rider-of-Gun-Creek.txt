The Boss Rider of Gun Creek

 Larry Day is convicted of a murder he didn't commit when several witnesses identify him. Pop Greer frees him amd takes him to his look alike Gary Elliott and has them change clothes. When Elliott is killed resisting arrest, Larry assumes his identity and this leads to trouble with the bad guys. Larry Day is riding in a rodeo when Starr Landerson, whom he has never seen before, calls him Gary Elliott and asks why he is masquerading under another name. After the contest, Larry is arrested by Sheriff Blaine for the murder of Belle Turner, whose father, Lafe Turner, identifies him as the killer. Pop Greer holds up the sheriff in order to help Larry escape. Pop knows rancher Gary Elliott is a double for Larry, and wires him arranging a meeting at the place of Indian Danny Lightfoot saying he has information on the murder of the girl. Danny gets Elliott intoxicated, Larry changes clothes with him and Elliott is killed by the arriving posse. Larry rides to Elliott's ranch, as Elliott, hoping to prove he was the real killer. He saves Starr Anderson from a runaway, but is knocked unconscious. She takes him to the Elliott ranch where Dr. Northrup says he is suffering from amnesia. Larry plays along and soon learns that Elliott had loaned Starr $100,000 on her cattle, but most of her herd has been rustled. Larry also discovers Starr's ranch contains a gold mine. He learns from Dr. Northrup that Elliott's business associates are Sheriff Marsden and banker Ed Randall and Larry, as Gary, tells the pair he is renewing the mortgage on Starr's ranch. This doesn't fit their plans to take over her ranch and, by a ruse, they learn Larry's true identity and send for Sheriff Marsden. But Pop Greer shows up with the secret to the missing cattle, and the battle is transferred to the outlaw's hideout.
