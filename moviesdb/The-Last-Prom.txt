The Last Prom

 Sandy goes to the prom with her boyfriend, Bill. Bill has just bought a new car and is anxious to show Sandy what it can do. The two of them go speeding around town in his car, only to wind up crashing into a tree, which kills them both. Moral parents you were going to--kills. Told in flashback, Judy Grant and Sandy Clark are best friends, excitedly looking forward to their prom-night dates with Bill and Jim. They're popular at school and have everything going for them. But the tale is mixed with plenty of tragic foreshadowing. The boys, who foresaken bicycles for fast wheels, have decided to play "cool" and sneak alcohol into the prom. After a few slow dances, Bill and Jim talk their dates into going for a little ride ... one in which Sandy will never return. A clearly intoxicated Bill steps on the accelerator and, unmoved by pleas to slow down, slams into a railroad overpass. The blood-stained hole in Bill's windshield, in which Sandy went through upon impact, sets the viewers up for the final scene where emergency room doctors desperately try to save Sandy's life. The final scene wherein a teacher notes the desks that will remain empty for the rest of the school year and the funeral scene underscore the movie's "drinking and driving" message aimed at teen-agers. This movie was often shown in high school driver's education classes in the 1980s, often in the spring to encourage teen audiences to make the right decisions.
