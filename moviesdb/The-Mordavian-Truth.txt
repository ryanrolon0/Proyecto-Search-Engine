The Mordavian Truth

 The Mordavian Truth is a documentary about a group of people coming together to participate in a very different hobby. We explore the concept of LARPing (Live Action Role Playing) through the people involved in New Zealands' largest LARP game, "Mordavia". Over a period of two and a half years we follow our unique subjects as they deal with the trials and tribulations of everyday life whilst attempting to save the kingdom of Mordavia.
