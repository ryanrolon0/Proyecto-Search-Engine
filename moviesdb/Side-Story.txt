Side Story

 A musical-within-a-musical comedy. Two high schools have combined to perform a one-night-only production. Over the weeks of rehearsals, 17-year-old Nate has fallen madly in love with a beautiful dancer named Taylor. He could have made a move, but each time he tried, fate worked against him in the cruelest (and funniest) of ways. Now, Nate has less than an hour until the curtain opens and his chance is gone. This is "Glee" meets "How I Met Your Mother" combining big dance numbers with a side splitting comedy about first love. Over the series, Nate and his friends will experience the ridiculous highs and incomparable lows of love and the theatre - from tackling the lead actor into an orchestra pit, being chased by a hungry pack of homeless men, tracking down a naked, high, moon burnt friend and expressing your deepest feelings in front an audience of hundreds.
