The Newcomer

 Made circa the era when a panda was the current zoological stellar attraction (and rarity) in American zoos. Here, a baby panda is getting all the attention in the zoo by visitors and staff, and this rouses jealously in the other animals, especially the lion. The lion breaks out of its cage and is chasing the panda around the zoo (with a meal in mind) but the panda is rescued by a kangaroo.
