The Spirit of Mickey

 Once in a Blue Moon, a single character comes along and makes the whole world laugh. From the moment Mickey Mouse appeared on the big screen whistling on a steamboat, Walt Disney's endearing little mouse captured hearts and tickled bones. And he hasn't stopped. Now, in celebration of the world's most famous and best-loved character, his best friends - Minnie, Donald, Goofy and the gang - present Mickey through the years in his most memorable movie shorts. From Mickey's color debut in "The Band Concert," to the never-before-released-on-video "Orphan's Picnic" and "Mickey's Surprise Party," to the inspired "Mickey and the Seal," The Spirit of Mickey is an engaging collection of Mickey's best and brightest.
