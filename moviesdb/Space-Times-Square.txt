Space Times Square

 Drawing from Sartre and McLuhan, "Space Times Square" is an experimental documentary offering a meditative journey through the mediated cosmos that is Times Square - an expanding universe of voids and nothingnesses, image and information, entertainment and inquisition, iPod people and hive-minds, flash mobs and flat-screens, terror warriors and terrifying war, black holes and vanishing points, cyberspace and outer space. Filled with hypnotic images, philosophical insight, poetic narration, and original electronic score.
