The Consultant

 Miles Massey is a consultant of sorts. He does not talk money, relationships or current affairs. Instead, he offers his talents to those who've had enough of this place, to those seeking a way out. He provides all the plans and advice necessary for a polished and flawless suicide. A young man comes to see him one day and gets more than he bargained for. Who is Miles Massey and why does he do what he does?
