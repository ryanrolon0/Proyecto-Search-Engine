The Uninvited Guest

 An instructional film for the hotel industry warns against the dangers of hotel fires, which can be caused by the carelessness of cigarette smokers (on the staff and among guests), kitchen workers (who are inattentive to grease fires) and the housekeepers (whose supplies are highly inflammable). The effect of fires can be made worse through panic, ignorance and recklessness. The film teaches methods of preventing fires, ways to control them and means to escape them. The film begins with a lecherous hotel worker patting the behind of an offended housekeeper as she tries to read a bulletin about fire prevention and ends with their response to the fire they just discovered.
