Realms

 A historical drama about loyalty and power, is set at the time of Henry II Plantagenet's (Becket, Lion in Winter) death at Chinon Castle in 1189. The plot pivots on a clash of interests between Henry's bastard son and chancellor, Geoffrey Fitz Roy, and William Marshal, the leader of Henry's troops. Besides losing their powerful jobs, both men are thrown on the mercy of the heir to the English throne, Richard the Lionheart. Their shared dislike for Richard is not enough to forge an effective alliance for the revenge that each in turn proposes. The movie's handsomely staged and lit interiors were shot in full HD in a Charlotte NC studio and at Castle McCulloch, and composited against exteriors shot at Chinon Castle, France.
