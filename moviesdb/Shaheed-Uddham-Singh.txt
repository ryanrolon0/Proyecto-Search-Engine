Shaheed Uddham Singh

 Udham Singh was born and brought in a Sikh family in Punjab, India, during the time when the British ruled India. Enraged at the massacre of over 2000 men, women, and children at the hands of Brigardier General Edward Harry Dwyer (Tom Alter) in Jallianwalla, (now known in History books as the Jallianwalla Baug Massacre) Udham Singh swears vengeance. He sets about creating obstacles for the British, and is soon on wanted lists by the authorities, on one occasion he is shielded by a courtesan, Noor Jehan (Juhi Chawla). In order to achieve his vengenace, he travels to the United Kingdom, befriends the local Indians, as well as Irish Freedom Fighter, Irene Rose Palmer (Charleen Carswell). He finally kills Dwyer during a presentation. He is quickly apprehended, and jailed. He refuses to cooperate with the authorities, nor is he willing to accept that he is mentally incapable. His trial is a mockery and travesty of justice. He is ordered to be hung, and the press are forbidden to publish the trial proceedings.
