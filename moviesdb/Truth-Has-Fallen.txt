Truth Has Fallen

 "Truth Has Fallen" is a one-hour 35mm live action/animated documentary that follows the work of James McCloskey. Mr. McCloskey founded Centurion Ministries, whose mission is to free prisoners who have been wrongfully convicted of murder. Employing a combination of abstract animation and live action images, "Truth Has Fallen" asks how innocent people could be convicted of murder- what can be done to prevent such injustices in the future- and what happens to these innocent people after they are released from prison after years of incarceration?
