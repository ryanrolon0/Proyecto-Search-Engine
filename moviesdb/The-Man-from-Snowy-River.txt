The Man from Snowy River

 When Jim Ryan arrives at the station (ranch) of John Conroy, looking for work as a station hand, he and Kate (the daughter of John Conroy) fall in love at first sight. Jim incurs the wrath of John Conroy, and when the colt from old 'Regret' jumps the fence and joins the wild bush horses, John Conroy mistakenly thinks that Jim is to blame for what happened and he orders Jim to leave the property. The colt is worth a thousand pounds and John Conroy offers a reward to anyone who can bring the valued colt home again. All the crack riders from the stations near and far arrive at the homestead to take part in the chase, but, it is Jim Ryan who is successful in bringing the wild bush horses back to the property. John Conroy is delighted to get the colt back again, and all of his objections to Jim are swept aside. All ends happily, with Jim Ryan's courageous and legendary ride being celebrated by a concert and dance, and by a superb equestrian pageant.
