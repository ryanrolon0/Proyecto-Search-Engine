Speak Easy

 An ordinary day in the city. 11 young people engaged in one of their just as ordinary activities. Talking on the phone; talking as they always do about nothing special - about boredom, being together (or not), ambition or the lack of it, sex, insecurity and the desire to have fun. Through the commonplace and the trivial they reveal what they normally only show each other.
