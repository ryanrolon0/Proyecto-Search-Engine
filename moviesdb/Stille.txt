Stille

 On the 11th birthday of her own child, Lily - daughter of a refugee from Hitler's Germany - reminisces about a childhood trip her family took back to her father's native city of Vienna. Through the lens of memory she re-visits the pain of remembering, tinged with the fear of forgetting, that silently haunts her father, herself, and her young daughter.
