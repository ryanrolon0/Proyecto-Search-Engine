Traffic Jam

 Traffic Jam is a 5 minute documentary produced for the Reel Ideas Studio Community Competition. It portrays five different points of view about traffic jams caused by vehicles in one of the biggest cities of the world, Mexico City. Short travel distances, extreme traffic congestion generating demand for space greater than the available road capacity and vehicles fully stopped for periods of time are the every day life of the people living in or near the city limits. The impact vehicle traffic has on people's lives and possible solutions are discussed in this documentary from the point of view from different social backgrounds.
