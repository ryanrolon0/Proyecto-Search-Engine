The Long Lunch

 East tangles none-too-gently with West, in this hilarious action-comedy where everyone seems to have had a little too much Chicken Chow Mein. All the 5 hardened criminals wanted to do was eat lunch at a Chinese restaurant (The Prosperous Palace) and plan the next day's robbery. Before the first bottle of cognac has even destroyed any brain cells, the restaurant staff have overheard the plans and are making plans of their own to hijack the heist. So with the help of a moody waitress, a roast-duck-obsessed chef and an ancient ex-Hong Kong cabbie who's a few steamed dumpling's short of a Dim Sum, the staff embark on the job. The catch - do the raid and be back before the bill is paid.
