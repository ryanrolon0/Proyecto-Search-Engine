The Secretary Who Stole £4 Million

 When Joyti De-Laurey gets a temp job as a PA for a manager at Goldman Sachs she is determined to make a good impression. Going the extra mile she quickly gets offered a permanent job. She starts working long hours, sorting out her bosses' professional and personal life as much as her own. Soon the money around her starts to make her dream and it is then that she starts to write cheques to herself for a few thousand here and there. Her family may worry about her long hours but Joyti lies to them about new jobs and promotions and they generally are happy with the money coming in. As she treats herself to endless jewelery and clothing her greed grows as she heads on her way to a stolen life of luxury built on £4 million of other people's money.
