So I Say

 Second W.W, somewhere in Transylvania. A German soldier is found dead near the village. Either the local authorities will find the guilty one, or they will be all shot by the Nazis, the morning after. There's no way to find the guilty one, but there's Ipu, the madman of the village, whom they will promise a funeral like for a hero if he will accept to die at their place. Will he?... time is running...
