Retuning Education

 When a school low on admittance, tries to play off a 'Musical' program that is similar to something seen in popular teen movies and shows, several students jump at the chance to be famous. Shot like a documentary we follow the stories of Mac (a boy with a big dreams and a heart to match) Roger (who followed his love into a program he has no business being in) and Sheila (who thinks she is already made it to the big-time) as they try to become famous, realize their true potential, and just try to survive being a freshman.
