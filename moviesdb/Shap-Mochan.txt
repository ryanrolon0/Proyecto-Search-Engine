One of his forefathers was cursed by his guru that anyone in his family who would practice music will either die prematurely or be disabled because he insulted the guru by not accepting him as the guru.

Because of extreme poverty Devendra sends Mahendra to Calcutta to His friend ( Kamal Mitra ) to help Mahendra get a job and earn money to help the family. His daughter Madhuri ( Suchitra Sen ) takes care of Mahendra and polishes him for the high society including the table manners.
