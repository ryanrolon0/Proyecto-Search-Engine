The Trail

 The Nappalogin Trial is 2,174 miles of endurance, intrigue, and beauty. Anyone that has conquered all or even part of the trail has stories to tell that will last forever. College senior Dillon McCray recently lost the brightest light in his life, his mother. One of his fondest memories of her are the trips they took to the Nappalogin Trail. In an attempt to come to peace with her passing, Dillon, along with two childhood friends, set out for a ten day hike through the Nappalogin. After Dillon sees what he calls the "lights", he decides to wonder off the path. It's then when unexplainable events begin to occur one after another. Soon the trio becomes lost and they question their decisions, friendships, and lives.
