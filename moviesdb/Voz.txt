Voz

 Somewhere Michael Winfield, a 23-year-old disturbed man, evolved, but is it because of his poor upbringing or the scientific study he was enrolled in at birth? 'Voz' looks at the balance between reality and morality through the relationships that Michael develops throughout his life, but what happens when the voices in his head overtake his own thought? Does he take control of his situation or does he lose control to the voices?
