The Big Green

 A short film in the classic American Noir tradition. In a world where unfettered industrialization is condoned at every level of society, a modern Eve offers redemption to Adam, instead of his downfall. Written, shot, and edited in 7 weeks, on a budget less than $500; first time filmmaker Mark E. Poole strives to explore what is possible within the Micro-Cinema movement.
