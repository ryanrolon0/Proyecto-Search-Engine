The Lazy Assassin

 The Assassin wakes up to another day, just like the last. Will there be another hit waiting for him in the mailbox? He hopes not, because his work just doesn't excite him like it used to. When he sees his next hit, the Well-Dressed Man, the Assassin knows it's his last chance. When the job doesn't go as planned the Assassin knows his days are numbered. Does he care? In the end, one man will die and one man will get to eat more peanuts.
