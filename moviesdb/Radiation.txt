Radiation

 A young Spaniard music promoter (Unai Fresnedo) finds himself in trouble when a club owner refuses to pay him for a gig and his drug supplier is pressuring him for money. With another band (Come) waiting for him at the airport, he goes on the run with hopes of shaking out some cash that never comes. Ignacio Fernandez is his long suffering partner and Katy Petty is a performance artist seeking to get her big break.
