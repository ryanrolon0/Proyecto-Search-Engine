Rose & Alexander

 A young woman, ROSE DELONGPRE, yearns for acceptance from her mentally ill father, while struggling to break free from the clutches of her overprotective brother to whom she finds herself sexually attracted. Rose alone must cope with the aftermath of a murder, her rape and her unborn child pleading to her from the womb. Add to this the angelic SYMPHONY, spirit of the electronic arts, reminding us that this is just one of many voyeuristic fantasies made possible by the advent of digital cinema!
