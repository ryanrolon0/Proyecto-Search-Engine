Virgin Tears

 In Caracas a statue of the Virgin Mary weeps tears of blood. I took my camera to investigate.  When my film was almost finished, I found myself in front of another camera, weeping black tears, my face covered in soot. I didn't make this film. It just happened through misfortune and coincidence.
