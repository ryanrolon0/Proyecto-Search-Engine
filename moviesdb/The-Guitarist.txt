The Guitarist

 Widower Noah lives a lonely existence. A skilled guitarist, he's settled into a quiet routine playing at the local tavern of friend Ian, and plucking at his guitar in his barren apartment. When his drug-addicted daughter Carrie dies of an overdose, Noah's life plunges into despair. His only solace is in his music and Ian's generous offer to open his home to recuperate. But when Noah meets Ian's troubled teen daughter Elizabeth, the unlikeliest friendship is formed through Noah's music and life begins to change for them both.
