Urwaldmärchen

 Miguelito, the son of a farmer, befriends a fierce-looking but meek dragon and takes him under his wing. He persuades the dragon, despite its fear and low self-esteem, to help him accomplish a great task. The princess has lost the Bird of Happiness, and Miguelito promises that he will find it again. In order to do that, he and his dragon friend must face the wicket witch. On his own, Miguelito is not strong enough, and on its own, the dragon is not brave enough. But together they can do anything.
