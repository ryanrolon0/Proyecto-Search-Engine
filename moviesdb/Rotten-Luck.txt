Rotten Luck

 A short, black and white silent film that is a mix of Buster Keaton and Night of the Living Dead. A man takes a job as a night watchman at a cemetery so he can afford to buy the girl of his dreams a bouquet of flowers, but when he comes across an ancient spell book and accidentally awakens a horde of zombies, things go awry. He has until his boss comes back at sunrise to get the zombies back in their graves!
