The Way of All Pants

 A man is delivering a pair of trousers that a woman has ordered for her husband. She asks him to try them on himself, so that she can see how they fit. But as he is in the middle of changing, the husband arrives home, sees the apparent intruder, and asks a detective to help catch him. Caught without his own pants, the delivery man manages to take the detective's pants from him, setting off a chaotic series of similar incidents.
