Stupidman

 STUPIDMAN ambitiously traces this loveable but dimwitted super-hero's beginnings from his dramatic escape off the doomed planet Crapton to his arrival on Earth where as Kent Clark, his unusual talents are soon exploited by his cash-strapped new parents. He eventually gets a job at the curiously outdated Evening Moon newspaper where he is easily misled by the frustrated, career-driven reporter Lotus LamE and her geeky, sexually ambiguous sidekick, Jamie Oldstone. When insane/evil environmentalist Lax A. Tiv has his bumbling stooges Nipps LeTrog and Clyde Pigsqueal kidnap Managing Editor Barry Black, Clark's rescue attempt is delayed by his elaborate costume change and a flirtatious flight with Lotus LamE. Can the stupidest man on the planet save the most hard-boiled editor in Megalopolis? And how long can he possibly protect his secret identity?
