To Beauty

 An androgynous prostitute dressed only in red makes her way to work through a city devastated by a war. Based on six paintings by German Expressionist artist Otto Dix, "To Beauty" offers a glimpse into the lives of post-Iraq War veterans, prostitutes, and homeless in a whimsically colorful world.
