 Awarded First Prize and Best Cinematography at the Hamilton 24-Hour Film Festival 2009. The competition requires that the film include a prop (Canadian flag), location (inside of car), and line of dialogue ("Show me the money"). This film is designed to express three viewpoints on the effects of war, as we've had too many soldiers returning in boxes from overseas lately.
