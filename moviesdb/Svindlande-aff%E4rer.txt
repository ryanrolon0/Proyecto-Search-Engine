Svindlande affärer

 Goesta Eriksson, a hairdresser, buys a car from used-car dealer Bertil Planaaker. But Goesta soon discovers that the car is a wreck. Planaaker won't give him his money back, in fact he denies ever having seen Goesta. Goesta's brother Rolle is released from prison and promises to help him. They form an investment company, Parabola, and convinces Planaaker to invest a lot of money in it. Planaaker has a lot of shady business colleagues who also invest their money. Goesta's and Rolle's scam becomes much bigger than they had bargained for.
