Prize-Winning Trip of the Santos-Dumont Airship No. 6

 This film is unique, and is the only one which was made of the celebrated trip on the 19th of October, 1901,when Santos-Dumont navigated his balloon from the park of the Aero Club around the Eiffel Tower, and back, winning the Deutsche prize. The balloon is seen coming out from its shed, and rising majestically in the air. The propellor turns, and the balloon is off on its long journey.
