Show Girl in Hollywood

 'Rainbow Girl' has just opened and closed on Broadway when Dixie runs into smooth talking Hollywood Director Frank Buelow. He tells her she would be a natural and she goes to Hollywood, but there is no contract for her. She meets Donny on the lot and Donny becomes her friend. Frank is fired when he returns and the new director finds that Frank's storyline is a copy of 'Rainbow Girl'. They call Jimmy for the rights and he comes out and his gal Dixie, the understudy on Broadway, gets the lead. But thing start going wrong when Dizzy Dixie goes Hollywood and thinks that she is better than the picture or the studio.
