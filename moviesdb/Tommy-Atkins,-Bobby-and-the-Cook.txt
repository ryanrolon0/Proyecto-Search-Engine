Tommy Atkins, Bobby and the Cook

 "Here is a soldier enjoying the hospitality of the kitchen maid, and having a real good time. There comes a knock on the door, and he hides behind a screen, while cook hurriedly clears the table. In comes a bobby, who kisses the maid, and sits down to the table and eats. He hears a noise behind the screen and gets up to investigate. Discovers the soldier, and a rough and tumble fight follows."
