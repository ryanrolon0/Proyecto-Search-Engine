Princess Charming

 Revolution breaks out in a small European kingdom, and a young princess is forced to flee for her life. She heads for the neighboring country, which just happens to be ruled by the king she is betrothed to. Unfortunately, the new revolutionary government won't let citizens leave, which she actually doesn't mind all that much because she's not particularly jazzed about marrying the elderly king. He sends a young naval officer to bring her across the border, but in order to do so they are forced into a marriage of convenience. Complications ensue. The King of Aufland , in order to raise funds for his bankrupt country, planes to marry Princess Elaine of a neighboring country. He sends Captain Luana, head of the Royal Guards, there to bring her back, and he arrives just as a revolution breaks out in her country. To expedite getting her across the border, Captain Luala marries the princess. And they fall in love and report to the King that they have no intention of getting an annulment. The King is a bit upset by this turn of events, but Countess Annette, who has her own agenda of marrying the King, helps the lovers escape across the border back to her now-peaceful country.
