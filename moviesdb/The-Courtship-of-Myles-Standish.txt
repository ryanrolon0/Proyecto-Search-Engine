The Courtship of Myles Standish

 A dramatization of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem 'The Courtship of Miles Standish,' this is the story of the Pilgrims who fled religious persecution in England and came to America aboard the Mayflower. John Alden, after numerous adventures at sea and with Indians on land, is asked by his friend Myles Standish to seek for him the romantic favor of his secret beloved, Priscilla Mullens. But Priscilla has eyes for another--John Alden.
