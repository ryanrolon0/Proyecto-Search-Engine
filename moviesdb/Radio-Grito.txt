Radio Grito

 In the tradition of Cesar Chavez and farm labor organizing, Radio Grito is a small Spanish language radio show for migrant workers and their families in California's San Joaquin valley. The film illustrates the empowerment, independence, and education that a grassroots radio project can provide for a community in need.
