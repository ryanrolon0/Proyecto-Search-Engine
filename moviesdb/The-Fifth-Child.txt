The Fifth Child

 The Fifth Child is a classic English horror novel by Doris Lessing. It is certainly one of her most compelling and memorable works. It is a parable. However comfortable and safe we think we are in our daily lives usually something brutal and dark out there lurking, waiting to get us.
