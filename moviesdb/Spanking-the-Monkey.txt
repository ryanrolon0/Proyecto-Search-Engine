Spanking the Monkey

 Raymond Aibelli is a promising medical student ready to begin a prestigious summer internship. But Susan, his mother, is immobilized by a broken leg, and his father Tom, a travelling salesman, makes Raymond stay home and take care of his mother, an attractive though unhappy woman. His mother's condition leads them to a degree of immediate physical contact which Raymond finds disturbing. He soon meets Toni, a high school girl, but his sexual impulses are increasingly confused, especially since he is still upset over losing the internship. Ray is a promising pre-med student at MIT, home briefly (he thinks) before leaving again for a prestigious internship. His plans evaporate when his callous father insists he stay home to care for his mother after an accident, while the father travels on sales calls. The ensuing days are spent struggling to run the large suburban household alone, masturbate undisturbed, and keep his mother happy. The boredom and Vodka tonics kick their Oedipal urges into overdrive, and the girl next door only adds to his confusion.
