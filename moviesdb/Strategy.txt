Strategy

 Jack Merrill was prosperous. He possessed, but did not wholly deserve the love of his patient little wife and daughter. His besetting sin was selfishness. The home which would have been beautiful and attractive to Jack did not mean to him what home implies to the well regulated mind. The club, with its poker game and convivial highball, occupied the evenings that should have brought happiness to the wife and baby, who loved and longed alone. Yes, Jack was selfish. One night, while keeping the lonely vigil, her heart aching with her husband's neglect, the wife resorts to strategy in the hope of regaining her loved one. Jack arrives at this home in a rather unsteady condition. On his library table he discovers the note. Alice secretly observes him from behind the portieres and feeling that his punishment has been sufficient, sends baby in to relieve the situation. Baby clasps her papa's knees just as he is about to fire the shot which would have ended his life. His hand is stayed. "Where is mamma?" he asks. Baby points to the bedroom. "Mamma and you have been playing a little joke on daddy, eh? Yes. Well, you go and tell mamma I want to see her." Baby runs out of the room to obey. Jack revolves the matter in his mind and determines to turn the tables.
