Sixth Happiness

 The unusual story of a boy who will never grow. Born with a disease that makes his bones brittle, Brit, as he is appropriately named by his mom, will be four feet tall for life. But he doesn't think small. He has his own spirited way of dealing with the world, and the cast of characters that surrounds him helps ensure that life is never dull with movie star looks, a doting sister, and numerous other mentors, lovers (both male and female), and charlatans who come in and out of the picture.
