The Real Sherwood Forest

 Sherwood Forest is famous all around the world as home to the legendary outlaw Robin Hood. This ancient forest grew out of the last ice age and has a fascinating history which is little known and will surprise all with its stories and secrets from over the centuries. The "Real Sherwood Forest" tells this epic tale of how a mighty and majestic forest has been a royal hunting ground, a hideout for outlaws, the setting for great monastic estates and later ducal palaces before mining and modern industry saw a reduction in much of the wild-woods. It is also a tale of hope as it celebrates the current conservation and restoration of this beautiful woodland which today attracts Robin Hood fans and tourists from all over the world to relax, to play and to connect with an ancient and mystical world.
