Return of Jewel Thief

 The British Government admits to taking the priceless Kohinoor diamond from India, but agree to loan it for an exhibition to a multi-millionaire Vinay Kumar. Vinay arranges for top security of this diamond, but it does get stolen. The prime suspects are himself, as he was accused of stealing jewellry several years ago; Police Commissioner Surya Dev Singh, the very last person to have handled the diamond, and being the son of Prince Arjun, a jewel thief; Con-man Johnny, who has acquired a reputation of being a jewel thief; Jukaso, a gangster of international repute; and Chief Minister Neelkanth. With the Chief Minister and the Police Commissioner themselves suspects, no one really knows who the real criminal is, as the crime unfolds, only one of the above has the real diamond, and will not part with it under any circumstances.
