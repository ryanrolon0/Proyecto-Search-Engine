The Prodigal

 In this modern-day retelling of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, a wealthy, life-of-the party charmer loses everything and reluctantly returns to the family and small town life he ran away from, to discover that truly finding his way home is going to take much more than a change of scenery-it's going to take a change of heart.
