The Snob

 Sarah, a pretty young high school student, doesn't want to associate with the other students at school, preferring to spend her time at home by herself, doing homework, etc. The other kids think she's a snob because of her behavior, but a fellow student's mother convinces them that all she really needs is for people to be friends with.
