The Cisco Kid and the Lady

 Just as Harbison kills a miner, Cisco and Gordito arrive and the dying miner rips his map into three pieces. Harbison tries to get the other two pieces but Cisco continues to outwit him. When Cisco takes the map from Billie who took it from Harbison, she identifies him and he is jailed. Having a change of heart she has a plan to get him out and he has a plan to trap Harbison.
