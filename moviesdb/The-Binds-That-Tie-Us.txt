The Binds That Tie Us

 A washed up cabaret singer in 1979, leaves her abusive, club owner husband to find shelter. Her subsequent choices change lives not even conceived of yet. This is a very cool deconstructionist style musical --It is 'The Hours' meets 'Chicago.' The short version stars Brian Krause (Leo in 'Charmed' and starring in an upcoming feature with Lauren Holly, 'You So Cupid!').
