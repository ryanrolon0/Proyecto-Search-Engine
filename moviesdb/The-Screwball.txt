The Screwball

 It's the day of the big baseball game between the Drips and the Droops and Woody Woodpecker is trying to crash the gate and get in without paying for a ticket. A policeman keeps tossing him out but Woody puts on a baseball uniform---including a baseball-cap, since baseball players do not wear hats---gets inside and soon gets involved with the game. He ends up pinned to the scoreboard by a deluge of baseballs thrown by everybody in the ballpark. A policeman acting as guard at the baseball game enjoys sticking his billy club through the peepholes in the fence and giving potential freeloaders black eyes. But the cop sticks his club through one particular hole and, after a long series of loud pecking noises, he pulls it back to see that it has been sharpened to the nub like a pencil. Woody Woodpecker is no ordinary gatecrasher, it seems; and he'll give the cop extraordinary trouble. First, Woody manages to get a free seat in the bleachers. Soon, the trouble making bird accidentally crushes the feet of the patron behind him, and then pulls out a small lawn mower in order to shave the view-blocking hairdo of the fella in front of him. But that's just the start of an adventure that leads to Woody pitching and batting for one of the teams.
