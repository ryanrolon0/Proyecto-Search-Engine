Ride Yonge Stay Young

 This year is the 20th anniversary of our Ride for Heart which is the largest 1-day cycling charity event in Canada. To celebrate this incredible milestone Rocco Rossi CEO of The Heart and Stroke foundation, of Ontario, has decided to undertake the greatest physical challenge of his life--cycling the length of Yonge Street, the longest street in the world, from Rainy River to Toronto, a distance of 1900 km, over 19 days. TLN Television provided Rocco with a Helmet Cam which allowed him to record his entire journey. All of the proceeds raised through "Ride Yonge--Stay Young" adventure will go towards the Heart and Stroke Chase McEachern Tribute Fund which aims to place Automated External Defibrillators in public spaces like hockey rinks and community recreation centres.
