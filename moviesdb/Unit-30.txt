Unit 30

 Not everything is as it seems when Scully and Mulder, no relation to Dana or Fox, move into the 'perfect' planned community. They soon cross paths with a mysterious package sent to an address that doesn't exist. Mundane situations gradually begin to get off kilter for the pair, and with Mulder's curiosity piqued, the duo decides to solve the mystery behind Unit 30. In the vein of Tales From the Crypt/Darkside, Unit 30 is a campy mystery with a surprising conclusion.
