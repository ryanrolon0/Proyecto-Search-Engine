The Foreclosure

 Mexican Joe held a mortgage on old John Watkin's place. He used that mortgage to press his suit for Jessie's hand. His persistence caused the old man's death by heart failure, and roused the ranch boys to a perfect fury. This was especially true of big James Wilcox, ranch foreman, who loved Jessie. On the death of her father, Jessie, refusing a hat collection from the boys, went her way alone. Then James took the matter into his own hands. How he brought prosperity and happiness out of woe and poverty you should see for yourself.
