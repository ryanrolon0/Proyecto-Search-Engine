The S.S. 'Deutschland' Leaving Her Dock in Hoboken

 A fine picture taken from the forward bridge of the "Deutschland" as she backs away from her pier. The bow of the ship is crowded with steerage passengers waving to their friends on the wharf. Thousands of people are congregated on the fine pier of the Hamburg-American line, waving farewell to friends on the ship. Numerous tugboats and river craft are gathered around the great vessel, making an interesting marine view.
