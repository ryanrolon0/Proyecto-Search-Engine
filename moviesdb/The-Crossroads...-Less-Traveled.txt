The Crossroads... Less Traveled

 A spoof of the old Robert Johnson rock n' roll myth about going down to the crossroads to trade your soul to the devil to become the world's greatest guitar player. But this time, it's Polka instead of Rock n' Roll with the devil personified by Lawrence Welk. In a final accordion showdown, Lawrence Welk defeats the neophyte accordion player. As payment, the defeated accordion players has to sacrifice polka to become a joke instead of the music of youthful rebellion. In other words, we are all living in an alternate reality where rock n' roll is now king.
