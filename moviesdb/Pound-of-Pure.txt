Pound of Pure

 Devon Murray indulged in a life of drug abuse and escape. When his girlfriend Tanya nearly over-doses as a result of their dangerous lifestyle, he is caught by the police and sent to a correctional facility for teenagers. Feeling only pain and regret after being released, he tries to re-kindle his relationship with Tanya, whom isn't as forgiving as he had hoped. Stepping back into the drug trade with his friend Jordan Devon gets into even more trouble - and finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
