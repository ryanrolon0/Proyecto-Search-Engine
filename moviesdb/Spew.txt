Spew

 Every summer, the nation's best and brightest high school debaters attend preparatory camps. SPEW documents the most exclusive of these camps Dartmouth Debate Institute (DDI) in Hanover, New Hampshire. Each year, the DDI culminates in a institute-wide tournament, the winner of which has gone on to win the national high school Tournament of Champions sixteen of the last eighteen years.
