Swami

 Swami, Radha and their kid shift to Mumbai after selling off their ancestral home in a village. In Mumbai, they get their kid admitted to a school that's patronized by children belonging to affluent families. Everything is going fine until Radha falls ill and is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Swami starts working overtime to raise funds for the operation, but Radha spends the entire amount on a chair that Swami wants to possess so dearly. Radha passes away with just one desire should settle down in America some day. How Swami works towards that dream is the remainder of the story. An ardent devotee of Bhagwan Shree Ganesh, Marathi-speaking Hindu Brahman Swami gets married to Tamil-speaking Hindu Brahman Radha, and both live a fairly harmonious lifestyle in rural India. It is only after 10 years of married life that a son, Anand, is born. When Radha finds out that better educational facilities are available in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Bangalore, they sell their house, and re-locate in Mumbai, where Swami finds employment with Shilpi Jewelers, and gets Anand enrolled in Hansraj Morarji High School. Radha then gets diagnosed with an kidney ailment and needs surgery, both attempt to save money to get her treated, but Radha instead uses these funds to buy Swami a rocking chair, gets Swami to promise that Anand gets a good education and settle down in America, and then she subsequently passes away. Swami undertakes to raise Anand on his own but will he able to fulfill the promise he made to Radha?
