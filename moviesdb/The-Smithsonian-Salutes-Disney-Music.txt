The Smithsonian Salutes Disney Music

 Snow white and the seven dwarves get invited to the Smithsonian for a "Salute to Disney Music", and throughout the special, live action Snow white and Seven Dwarves tour Washington DC on their way to the concert, where broadway performers sing classic Disney songs at the Smithsonian. It is an entertaining night, where fabulously performed songs are interspersed with the performers and others discussing how great the music is, and what Walt Disney was trying to achieve. At the end of the show, Snow White shows up, and she and one of the four singers performs "I'm wishing" from Snow White, and then the show ends.
