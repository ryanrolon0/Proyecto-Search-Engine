Saatanan radikaalit

 Accustomed to the heat of the sauna, four dead Finns enjoy their days in Hell so much that they are sent on a temporary leave back to Earth. Blessed with a specific ban on doing any honest work while down there, yet cursed with an inability to enjoy alcohol any longer, the quartet lands in modern-day Finland with a briefcase full of cash. Of course, in only a matter of minutes the guys misplace the briefcase, and after that they are pretty much on their own. However, you can't blame them for running out of ideas too quickly.
