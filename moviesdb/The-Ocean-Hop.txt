The Ocean Hop

 Oswald the Rabbit is taking part in a race across the Atlantic, from New York to Paris by plane, with a grand prize of $25,000. A trickster competing in the race puts chewing gum on Oswald's tires so he's not able to start with the others, and to make matters worse, his plane's wings fly away without him. He improvises by strapping a wooden plank and a couple of balloons to a wiener dog, and is shortly back in the race once again, where the hijinks continue unabated.
