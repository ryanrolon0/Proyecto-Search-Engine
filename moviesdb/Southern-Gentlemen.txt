Southern Gentlemen

 When a prominent politician's daughter turns up dead in a small Mississippi town many questions need to be answered. Detective Stonewall is on the case and when he finds out that the dead girl (Calli) had two lovers then things heat up for him. Xavier and Ty both have opportunity, motive and no alibi. The story takes place as the two young men tell their accounts of the previous night to Stonewall. Both their stories aren't adding up and Stonewall must decide quickly who the guilty party is. Things are not what they seem to be in Lee County Mississippi.
