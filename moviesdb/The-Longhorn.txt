The Longhorn

 Remade in 1956 as Canyon River starring George Montgomery, this film has Wyoming rancher Jim Kirk (Bill Elliott) deciding to cross-breed his Texas longhorns with Herefords to develop what he hopes will be a heavier breed for meat stock. En route to Oregon to buy the Herefords, he takes his supposed-friend Andy (Myron Healey) with him, not knowing that Andy is part of a gang out to rob him. They are attacked by Indians, Jim saves the wounded-Andy's life, and leaves him at the home of Gail Robinson (Phyllis Coates) and her dad (I. Stanford Jolley) for medical attention. Jim buys the stock and and is on the homeward trek to Wyoming, accompanied by the still-plotting Andy, Gail and her father, and a crew of outlaws as his trail herders.
