Vanishing Son

 Two students (Jian-Wa and Wago) in the Peoples Republic of China are forced to flee out of China after having taken part in a protest action for freedom (reference is made to the fights at Tiananmen Square in 1989). They come to America, and try to build up a new life. After a while, one of the brothers pursues a musical career while the other gets entangled in a criminal organisation.
