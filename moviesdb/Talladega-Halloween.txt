Talladega Halloween

 Don, Lester, and Dale Earnhardt Jr, meet up with a pretty gal while trick-or-treating on Halloween, which happens to fall on the same day as the notorious Talladega NASCAR race. They all get caught inside the house of a crazy Kyle Busch fan. Mayhem ensues, as the four trick-or-treaters try to escape the clutches of a madman.
