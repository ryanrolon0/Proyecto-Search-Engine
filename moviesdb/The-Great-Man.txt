The Great Man

 W.C. Fields cultivated the persona of a misanthropic cynic and many found it hard to tell where the character ended and the real person began. Master juggler, Broadway headliner, and radio star, Fields eventually reached Hollywood superstardom. Included in this DVD are rare behind-the-scenes footage and home movies of Fields at work and at play, along with hilarious scenes from some of his greatest films.
