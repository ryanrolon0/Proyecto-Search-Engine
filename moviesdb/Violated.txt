Violated

 Filmed in New York City and intended for the niche market from art houses to back-street grind houses, with most of the distribution landing in the latter, "Violated" is the story of a serial/sex killer, Jan C. Verbig (Wim Holland), whose M.O. is cropping the hair of his victims. His love and pursuit of a burlesque dancer leads to his downfall and capture. A psychiatrist uses a truth serium to find the reasons for his abnormal behaviour.
