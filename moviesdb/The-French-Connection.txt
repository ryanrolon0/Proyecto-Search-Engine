As money troubles begin for the hoods they decide to kill Popeye and Buddy to give them enough room to bring in the Heroin. A combination of police procedural and action/car chase. Police partners Doyle and Russo put a candy store under surveillance based on a hunch that something fishy was going on. Eventually it turns out that the proprietors are involved in one of the biggest narcotics smuggling rings on either side of the Atlantic, and the cops go to work.
