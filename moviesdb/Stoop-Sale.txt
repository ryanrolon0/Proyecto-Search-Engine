Stoop Sale

 Brad and Daisy, a young couple in New York City, are breaking up and moving out of their apartment. On the last weekend before the move, they are having a 'stoop sale;' one last thing they will do together as a couple. Throughout the weekend they deal with many colorful characters, old boyfriends, family members, and most of all, each other.
