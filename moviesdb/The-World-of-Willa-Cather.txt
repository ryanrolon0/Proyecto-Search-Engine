The World of Willa Cather

 A documentary about the Nebraskan novelist, Willa Cather, author of "O Pioneers", "My Antonia", and "Death Comes for the Archbishop", among others. In a lyrical style that utilizes silent dramatic enactments from her novels along with voice-over readings from the texts, the documentary was filmed in the actual locales in which the novels take place.
