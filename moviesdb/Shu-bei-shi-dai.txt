Shu bei shi dai

 In hidden back-streets of Beijing's Hutongs, a poor family struggles to survive. Fu Gui's greatest wish is that his little daughter will be rich one day. However, he can't even afford the school fees. He sees a way out, but by taking this forbidden way Fu Gui risks losing everything and his face. In Fu Gui's neighborhood a beggar has already lost his face. He has no future and no name anymore. A bird in a cage is his only friend. Finally he even fails to commit suicide... A bittersweet story about poverty, desperation and hope in China. Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Economic growth for all or for a few? Security or absolute control? Innovative or fake products? Made in China.
