The Home Video Series

 The Home Video Series is a cumulative video work (9 films strong at present) made by artist Kate Rowles in collaboration with her parents between 2005-2010 (ongoing). The series situates performance for camera within the context of real life relationships and personal environments. Beginning with an understanding of family as 'verb', they investigate the many possible ways to frame, perform and record that 'doing' and the greater meaning behind it. Each video makes a different statement about who they are as individuals and as a family, and somewhere in between them all lies a blurry outline of overlapping lives.
