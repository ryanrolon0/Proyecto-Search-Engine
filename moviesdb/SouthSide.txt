SouthSide

 SouthSide's main protagonist is a young lad from Manchester called Billy Sheers who is definitely a sandwich or two short of a picnic. He has escaped form the northern city and traveled south to London in the hope he can make a new start for himself in the big smoke. Billy is on the run and hiding out because the notorious northern gangster Brian Burns wants his head on a stick for impregnating his one and only daughter. While hiding out, Billy runs into a series of unsavory characters on the rough streets of south London. They all seem to take advantage of his lack of intelligence and mistreat him in one way or another. Billy confides in one person on his lonely journey, an Irish street tramp called 'Charlie Slaney'. Charlie is also in a spot of trouble with a local street hood who is hot on his trail. There is only one way to go for Billy and Charlie and that's Southside.
