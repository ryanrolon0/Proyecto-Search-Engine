The Pleasure Seekers

 Made in response to the 80's swingers craze, this lusty feature puts a seductive light on what it means to be a "Swinger". It's all about pleasure and sometimes the best pleasure to be found is close at hand! Heather Wayne and Herschel Savage are a sexually-hip married couple in search of additional stimulation in their already robust sex lives. When friend Kristara Barrington catches them after a particularly rousing sex romp, they pull her into their new found activity - the strikingly exotic Kristara being more than a willing partaker. Contractor Marc Wallice comes into the picture after finding Heather and Kristara going at it and gladly abandons his gear to wield his tool. Amanda Jane Adams with boyfriend Dan T. Mann in tow, visit on the week-end and eagerly join in the swapping game. The action becomes hot and heavy with everyone switching out with every available partner in a frenzied group grope. Fans of the sultry Kristara Barrington and sumptuous Heather Wayne won't be disappointed!
