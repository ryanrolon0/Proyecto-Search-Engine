Rocco e i mercenari

 A man comes to retrieve his gold from the bank and cannot help but sleep with the bank director's daughter. As he is about to be hanged for it, Rocky rides into town and saves him from the gallows and the angry mob - before getting it on with his favorite whore. When a band of Mexicans arrive in town, the two team up with a group of mercenaries and save the day. Festivities conclude the joyous event.
