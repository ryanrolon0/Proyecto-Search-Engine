The Healing of Xrist

 The Healing of Xrist is the third of an ongoing series of videos featuring a Shaman-Clown named Xrist created and performed by RKDB. Xrist stands as a metaphor for a contemporary culture whose spiritual pursuits are embodied by a clumsy entertainer not fully in touch yet with the medicine he is seeking. This video explores the wounded healer trope of shamanism that calls for the practitioner to heal himself before he can heal others. Xrist must sacrifice to the idol of his spirit animal (in his case the elephant), giving up his eyes as metaphor for inner travel so that he may make an ecstatic journey to the spirit world to receive the power to heal.
