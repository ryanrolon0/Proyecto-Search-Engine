The Ladies' Room

 In a nightclub, the Crone, in the guise of a sexless, conservative woman sits in judgement of the human folly around her much, the latex-clad dominatrices who take their sport in ripping off desperate men, and a young couple who can't keep their hands off each other. Meanwhile in the Ladies' Room, the Cleaner exists in a limbo of endless cleaning until her orderly world is disturbed... with deadly results.
