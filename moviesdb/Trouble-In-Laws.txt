Trouble In-Laws

 Hugh is driving his brother-in-law's car, bumps into a fire hydrant and drenches a pretty blonde. She gets into the car, removes her dress to dry it, puts a lap-robe around herself...and then her husband shows up and tees off on Hugh. The husband land's in jail. Later, Hugh has to go to the Blonde's apartment, on business for his boss, and not too much longer after his arrival, Hugh, the Blonde, his Boss, the husband, Hugh's wife, Mother-in-law and brother-in-law are all involved, none of whom's involvement bids well for Hugh's welfare.
