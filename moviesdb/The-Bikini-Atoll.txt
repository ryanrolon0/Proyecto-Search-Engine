The Bikini Atoll

 The Bikini Atoll is an uninhabited atoll in one of the Micronesian Island in the Pacific Ocean. In the mid 40's the U.S. relocated the native inhabitants to test two bombs over water in a lagoon that was part of the Bikini Atoll. However, it became a site of more than 20 hydrogen and nuclear bomb tests between 1946 and 1958. This documentary shows what happened to the people who where asked to give up their island for two years. After 50 years the Bikinians still have not returned to their island. The clean up is still going on and the island is opened for diving to the wrecks that sunk when the bombs were dropped. The documentary tells about the history and the struggle that has gone on for the past 50 years.
