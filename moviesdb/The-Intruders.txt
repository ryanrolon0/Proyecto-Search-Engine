The Intruders

 Richard discovers, by chance, that the wife of an atomic scientist has an affair, and that their son was driving a car without a driving licence, and drunk.

Using his 'weapons' to pressure every person in the house, he gets all the sex he wants, until everybody is changing partners with everyone else...
