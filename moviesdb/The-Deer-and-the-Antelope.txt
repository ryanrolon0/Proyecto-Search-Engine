The Deer and the Antelope

 The Deer and the Antelope is a personal, experimental documentary that briefly explores the lives of Burton and Carla Cronin, the filmmaker's parents. The film blends interviews, home video and cinematic collage to suggest the randomness of memory and visual texture of perception.
