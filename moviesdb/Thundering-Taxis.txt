Thundering Taxis

 The wife of the owner of the Blacker Cab Company thinks a driver from a rival company has gotten fresh with her. He hasn't - it was an innocent mistake - but try telling that to her and her husband. He declares war on his rival, the Black and Blue Cab Company, and we watch his boys take out his anger on the Black and Blue team, particularly the driver in the initial misunderstanding and his closest friend. Will anyone live through the war and will any cab be left in drivable condition?
