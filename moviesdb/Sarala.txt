Sarala

 Melodrama warning women to be dutifully subordinated wives and not to be tempted by modernizing trends towards individual emancipation. The orphaned Sarala is estranged from her loving husband Ramdas by the wiles of villain Avilash. She runs away and, following divine intervention in the form of an earthquake, escapes the villain's clutches.
