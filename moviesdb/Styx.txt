Styx

 In a hospital in contemporary times, a woman's soul elevates from her body and embarks on a journey through time. In medieval Cyprus, two lovers witness a secret meeting between an alchemist and a cleric. A life-altering truth is revealed, a curse is placed and karma is born. The title is inspired by ancient Greek mythology the holy river of Styx to cross over to Hades. Charon escorted them there in return for golden coins. According to Plato, souls who drink the river's water fall into coma, until they complete their journey towards rebirth.
