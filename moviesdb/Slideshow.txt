Slideshow

 A young man is recounting a sexual encounter he had. In certain respects, the encounter has a feeling of the unknown, as the two did not speak and by the end neither knew the other's name. But in other respects, the encounter held a certain familiarity for him, as displayed by the fact of him telling the story using a slide show with photos of himself playing the part of his lover, with his real self playing himself.
