The Walking Wounded

 An alien invasion leaves the world in smoking ruins and seemingly devoid of humans. But Everett has managed to survive, and now he roams the blighted landscape of Los Angeles, hiding from hunter/killer drones as he embarks on a desperate quest to find his wife and child, who he has not seen since the invasion began. But instead, he finds Sadie, another hardened survivor, holed up in an empty building. In this new world, trust among strangers is hard-earned. But these two will have to learn to work together when they are discovered by an alien patrol.
