The Big Catch

 After 10 years in hiding, Maestro, the greatest thief of all time checks into a mental institute and eventually gets caught by a California Sheriff. The bizarre Maestro and his promiscuous midget side-kick Wellington are convicted and sent to maximum state prison, while the sheriff becomes a huge celebrity. While being heckled and disgraced by his fellow inmates for being caught, the Maestro reveals that he got caught on purpose. He has a plan. "My name hasn't been besmirched!" he declares, "I am about to pull off the greatest heist in human history!"... and he does.
