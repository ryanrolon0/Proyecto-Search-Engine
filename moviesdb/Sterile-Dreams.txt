Sterile Dreams

 This is the first film to address the illegal sterilization of minority Roma women in the Czech Republic. It follows three victims and their families in Ostrava. How they cope and find hope mirrors the fate of more than 80 other victims whose cases were investigated and supported by the Czech Ombudsman, and other victims in countries like Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia.
