Renoir à Hollywood

 Jean Renoir's period of wandering following the commercial failure of his film La Regle du Jeu (Rule of the Game) came to an end when he settled in Hollywood in January 1941. On a professional level, Renoir had a hard time with the studio system. He managed to complete a number of important films, but - with the notable exception of This Land is Mine and The Southerner - he had to compromise with working methods which were not his own. In his personal life, however, Jean Renoir feels completely at home in Hollywood Californian life suits him and he acquires US citizenship. Even after his career in France gets off a fresh star, he continues to live in Hollywood. The amazing story of his life is told by the director's son, Alain Renoir, and other close friends and collaborators such as John Renoir (his grandson), Norman Lloyd, Leslie Caron, Jean Slade and Yves Robert. Many clips from The Southerner (1926), Rule of the Game, and This Land Is Mine's theatrical tailer.
