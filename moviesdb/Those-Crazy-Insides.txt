Those Crazy Insides

 Deep in the recesses of an exotic netherworld, mischievous events take place. Submerged into the depths of imagination itself, a declassification of logic commences - things slip out of their systems and typologies altogether to co-inhabit a new digestible and diaphanous reality. Succulent and bizarre, gentle yet dangerous, 'Those Crazy Insides' is a sci-fi nature documentary of what really might be 'inside'.
