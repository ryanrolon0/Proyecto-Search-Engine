The Price of Beautiful

 THE PRICE OF BEAUTIFUL is about a little girl who witnesses an ugly incident on the street and does not understand why people can be so mean. Her father tells her the parable about the golden songbird in order to help explain the sweet side of our nature versus the darker side. Learning the lesson, the little girl reacts with an act of human kindness.
