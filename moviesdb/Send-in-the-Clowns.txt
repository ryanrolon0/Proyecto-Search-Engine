Send in the Clowns

 They came with colored wigs and red noses and left with black eyes and red faces... In February 2002, a team of international clown doctors visited Afghanistan - to demonstrate the healing power of laughter. But the locals didn't see the funny side when a disastrous audience participation routine involved lifting a woman's burka... Based on a true story - Send in the Clowns shows that laughter isn't always the best medicine.
