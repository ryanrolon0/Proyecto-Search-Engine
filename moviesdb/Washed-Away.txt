Washed Away

 Washed Away tribulations of the survivors in a post-Katrina New Orleans. Now on the eve of Katrina's four-year anniversary, the city of New Orleans has an unprecedented level of homelessness -more than four times that of most cities. The survivors were given the name "Homeless Homeowners" for residents who paid off their mortgages and forced into the street. Research has also shown that New Orleans has a three-fold increase in heart attacks, and other medical and psychological issues. This film gives an intimate portrait of the stress of everyday life after Katrina.
