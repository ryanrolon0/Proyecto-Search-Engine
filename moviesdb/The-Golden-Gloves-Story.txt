The Golden Gloves Story

 Joe Riley is a boxing referee whose life-code is the same as the sporting rules of the prizefight ring. Two Golden Glove (a tournament for amateur prizefighters) contestants Nick Martel, a tough, pugnacious kid from Chicago who has had to fight for everything he has in life, and Bob Gilmore, from the other side of life's tracks, are also competing for the affections of Riley's daughter, Patty.
