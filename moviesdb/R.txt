 This independent Indian debut is a film whose story tells of the death of a loved one and takes its characters along a path which will ultimately enable them to grasp the meaning of human existence and the universe as a whole. The tormented protagonist searches for the meaning of life in books. In one that he buys in a bazaar, he finds a marked passage that paints a precise picture of his situation. The address of the book's previous owner is written inside and the hero sets out to find him. He turns out to be the equable owner of a restaurant situated on a sunny beach in the middle of a captivatingly serene bay, who tells him that he was not the one who marked the passage. The film follows the journey of the book and its role in the lives of several people, tracing the way in which human destinies are bound together in time and space. Like the dialogues which abound in healthy insight and light spontaneity, it sees the Frisbee as a symbol of meditative reflection and offers alternative views of life, evolution, religion and also the tsunami catastrophe.
