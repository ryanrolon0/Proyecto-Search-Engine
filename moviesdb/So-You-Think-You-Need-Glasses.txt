So You Think You Need Glasses

 In this humorous but sometimes serious early entry into the McDoakes series of comedies, Mr. average Joe is suffering from far-sightedness and is sent by his wife to an opthamologist to get corrective glasses. Other common eye complaints including myopia, astigmatism, and nervous tics are discussed in an informative but humorous manner.
