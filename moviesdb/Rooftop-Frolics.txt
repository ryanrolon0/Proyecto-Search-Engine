Rooftop Frolics

 Occupants of two contrasting rooftops merge to put on a musical show. Representing the tenement roofers are singer Peg La Centra, child accordian player Gina Valenti and the dance team of Selden and Endler, while the swanky apartment building crowd is Al Cooper and his swing band and the high-hat tap dancers, The Debonaires.
