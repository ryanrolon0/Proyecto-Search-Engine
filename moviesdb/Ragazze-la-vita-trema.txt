Ragazze la vita trema

 Alessandra, Maria Paola, Marina and Liliana come from different geographical, cultural and social milieu and their lives crossed or just grazed each other in Rome between the end of the sixties and during the seventies. Their stories, told in first person today, are completed by vivid and present images from library audiovisual stock, in part private and never shown. It is told from a personal point of view. The "coming from oneself", formulated spontaneously during the Feminism season and was the basis of a new way making politics, now becomes historical narrative today. The story of the idea for a new world arose simultaneously in the whole country in the hearts of nearly an entire generation, a world in which "there was no violence, no misuse of power", a story unfolding along the parallel track of women's history. The awareness of oneself as a woman, self-awareness, loves, violence against women, divorce, contraception and abortion, work, theatre, free radios, sit-ins, moving personal experiences into collective ones for a more human world, of women and men, girls and boys. "Such an exiting period, revolutionary in the true meaning of the word, where step by step we obtain changes, changes that last and have altered the aspect not only of our lives, but also of the country we lived in and are living in today", Liliana says. "Well, probably it was not possible to make a revolution in Italy, thousands of mistakes have been made, but due to these mistakes everything has been cancelled, a pitiful veil has spread over everything. Why did we end up there?" Alessandra begins. Our girls are in theory responding to today's twenty and thirty year olds. We have to remember, give space and time to our memory in order to know who we are today.
