The Lovemaster

 Primarily a concert film of stand-up comedian Craig Shoemaker, a.k.a. The Lovemaster, the film is interspersed with vignettes of the situations described in the monologue, and framed by Shoemaker's therapy sessions. Shoemaker's forte is impersonation of characters, both real and imaginary, from his life and television.
