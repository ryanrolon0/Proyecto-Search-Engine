Two by Demian

 =(1)= "Director's Commentary" A house party host attempts to play matchmaker. While mutually attracted, the two guests she hopes to match have very different fantasies about each other. Ultimately, we learn the dark secrets that lie behind their social masks. Throughout the entire video we hear the director's commentary - just like on some fancy DVD videos - only you cannot shut the egotistical narrative off. =(2)= "T'ai Chi Chuan with Master T.T. Liang" Contains an interview with Master Liang and his performance of 5 T'ai Chi dances. Two of these are sword dances and two are two-person dances with his assistant, Alice Crooks. Master Liang (Jan 23, 1900-Aug 19, 2002) lived and taught in the U.S. about 30 years. Demian was a student of his in the early 70s.
