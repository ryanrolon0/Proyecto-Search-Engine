The Tramp's Gratitude

 Old Bill Meyer was given a position around the yard of the Pacific Lumber Company by the foreman. As the old fellow was destitute of a home, the foreman took him to his house and treated him kindly, thereby winning his gratitude. Lumber was being stolen from the yard and neither the owner nor the foreman could account for it. One night Meyer, who was accustomed to sleeping on a pile of lumber some distance from the yard, was awakened by the slamming of boards. Looking in the direction of the noise he sees the night watchman's figure retreating in the darkness. The following day the old man prevents the night watchman from delivering a treacherous blow upon the foreman by jumping between the two men and receiving the blow upon his arm. The foreman takes Meyer home, where his wound is dressed. After he had been given a substantial lunch he repairs to the lumber pile to eat it. There the watchman finds him and relieves him of the lunch. Hungry and without shelter Meyer passes the night and returns to work the next morning full of resentment. He sees no harm in stealing a few pieces of lumber with which to build a shanty. In the night of that day, the watchman was startled by seeing a board disappear. He gave chase and old Meyer dropped the board in the foreman's yard, where he had instinctively ran for shelter. The watchman sees a chance for diverting the blame from himself and he places more pieces of lumber there. The next day he reports to the owner and accuses the foreman, who, of course, denies it. The matter is finally straightened out by old Bill Meyer, who had overheard the watchman's accusation. The foreman is vindicated, the culprit convicted and Meyer finds a home with the foreman and his wife.
