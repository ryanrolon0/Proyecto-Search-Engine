The Laughter of God

 Nowadays increasing numbers of people are forced to flee their homeland, because of political turmoils, civil wars, ethnic cleansing. Based on a true story, "The Laughter of God" is about Mr. Goliath, a 40 year-old Algerian journalist and advocate of freedom of speech, who has never assimilated with any political, militant or religious groups. Because of his stand, condemned by both sides, he has to escape the disturbances of this undeclared war after the murder of his wife and son. With his only daughter, he finds refuge in the cosmopolitan island of New York. But for Mr. Goliath the tragedy is not over. Enclosed in silence, he has forged a permanent dialogue with God. Collecting clips of newspapers detailing the daily events in Algeria, organizing them in his notebook. The silence of Mr. Goliath is enhanced through his frail communication with his daughter, Yasmina, as he falls deeper into isolation and exile.
