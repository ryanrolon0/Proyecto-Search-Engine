School's Out

 The artists' stories are brought to life by the vivid narrations of Priscilla Pointer, Ossie Davis, and Geoffrey Holder. Viewers get to "listen to the artists" through the portrayals of these noted, professional actors. Throughout the documentary, there are discussions meant to help define the term "Self-taught Artist," and the differences between Folk Art and so called "Outsider Art" are explored. Parallels are drawn between the work of these artists and the art movements of their times, Cubism, Abstract Expressionism, and the other modern art "schools."
