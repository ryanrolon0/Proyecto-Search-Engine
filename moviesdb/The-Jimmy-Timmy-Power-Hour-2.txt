The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2

 Timmy Can't Find a Date to Dimmsdale's Elementry School Friday the 13th Dance. So he then remembers Cindy (From the First Jimmy Timmy Power Hour) and Then Goes to Retroville but takes Cosmo and Wanda with him. But Jimmy was planning on asking Cindy to the Linnberg Elementry School Dance. Jimmy and Timmy then preform Magic vs Science which then attracts Professior Calamorious Jimmy Neutron's arch enemy. But the Anti Fairies then escape from their prison and Anti Cosmo meets Calamorious and betrays him later. Can Jimmy and Timmy Save Then? Timmy Turner and Jimmy Neutron are both preparing for their upcoming Friday the 13th school dances. Remembering his time with Cindy Vortex from Retroville, Timmy decides to pick her up and take her to Dimmsdale, creating another rivalry between Jimmy & Timmy, which Professor Calamitous thinks he can take advantage of. However, not even Neutron's arch-nemesis is safe when Anti-Cosmo breaks Anti-Wanda and all the other Anti-Fairies out of Fairy World Prison to bring so much bad luck to Timmy's universe, that Friday the 13th could remain on the calendar forever.
