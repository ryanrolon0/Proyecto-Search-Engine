The Seven Swans

 Once upon a time there was a beautiful little Princess, Tweedledee, who lived with her father and seven brothers in 'The Kingdom of the Seven Dials'. The Wicked Queen, the Witch of the Bouncing Ball, turns Tweedledee's brothers into seven swans. From film advertisement, 'Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate', 18 January 1919.
