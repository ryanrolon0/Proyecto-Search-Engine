Really Decadent Guys

 In a time and place not unlike our own, the Really Decadent Guys have founded a new nation based on absolute hedonism, decadence, and hanky-panky. Though they are steering their country into the ground quite well on their own, apparently it cannot happen fast enough for Mr. Colosso, head of local doomsday-device manufacturer the Colosso Corporation, who, after a slight misunderstanding with The Guys, decides to utterly destroy them.
