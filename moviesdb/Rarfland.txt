Rarfland

 In this science-fiction-black-comedy, Chester, an introverted, anxiety-ridden genius develops a mind-control serum in order to take over a college campus. The only thing that halts Chester's ability to control everything around him is Felix, a boy dying rapidly of brain cancer. Told from a number of perspectives, the film is a narrative melting-pot, with equal doses of many genres.
