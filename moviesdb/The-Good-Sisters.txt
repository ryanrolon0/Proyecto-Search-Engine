The Good Sisters

 Breanne Good (Debbie Rochon) and her younger sister Kindra Good (April Monique Burrill) have lived together in a modest Maryland suburban house for several years to hide a secret life. They are both practionioners of witchcraft which they keep a secret from their neighbors. When a mysterious man named Daniel (David Calhoun) moves into their house next door, Breanna and Kindra become suspicious of their new neighbor who also leads a secret life. Unsure if he is unnaturally obsessed with knowing about them, or if he has an agenda, the Good sisters will have to draw up all their powers to confront this man.
