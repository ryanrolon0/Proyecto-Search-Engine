The Way of a Woman

 Nancy Lee is a well-bred member of the Virginia aristocracy. Her father forbids her marriage to the man she loves for reasons of social inequality. She consents to marry a wealthy man on her social plane in order to help her family out of difficulty, but he eventually leaves her a desolate widow in New York. Her efforts to extricate herself from this dilemma further subject her to shame, and disaster looms unless the young man she loved can save her.
