The Hollow Man

 The Hollow Man depicts a dysfunctional relationship between a father and daughter. After having spent a lifetime failing to connect they find themselves among the ruins of their neglected time together. They are trapped neither here nor there, neither living nor dying as they linger amid rubble and machine. They are forced to face the task of catching up with each other and are finally able to confess their most intense feelings about one another. They struggle towards redemption, with the frailty of the surroundings threatening this at every moment. Before the beginning and after the end they reason about whether their lives will start for real or end for good with a bang or a whimper. They are nowhere and its now.
