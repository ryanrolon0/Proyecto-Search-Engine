Proud Voices

 Proud Voices is a one-hour television interview special that takes an intimate look at four distinguished, and sometimes controversial individuals, who discuss the issues of being gay or lesbian when one's life is in the spotlight. Our stellar lineup of esteemed guests include four-time Olympic Diving Champion and author, Greg Louganis; one of the first openly gay U.S. politicians, Congressman Barney Frank; well-know television and film comedian, Sandra Bernhard; and Michelle Douglas, who after being accused of violating Canadian military policy, launched a landmark lawsuit against the military that forced it to change its discriminatory policies. The show is hosted by lawyer/comedian Maggie Cassella, who starred in The Vagina Monologues with Margot Kidder; was seen in the ABC movie of the week Kiss My Act; is seen regularly doing political satire for the CBC; appeared on her own show on STAR TV; as well as a commentator, legal analyst, red carpet host, and celebrity interviewer. She was also seen on BRAVO as one of the many comics featured in the documentary film We're Funny That Way.
