The Scarlet Spear

 Deep in the African jungle territory, Telec District Commissioner Jim Barneson, and his new bride Christine/Chris, try to persuade Morasi, newly-crowned chief of the Masai, to abandon the age-old ritual of proving himself worthy to rule by slaying a rival tribe member and thus earing a "scarlet spear." Jim follows Morasi into enemy territory, and is present and helps fight off the enemy tribe during Morasi's test. Morasi, badly wounded, makes his way back to his tribe, where he pledges no human life will be taken in the future... and dies. His young son takes his spear and strides resolutely into the jungle... to earn his "scarlet spear."
