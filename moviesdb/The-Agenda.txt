The Agenda

 Kelly Summers isn't where she'd thought she be at 35. She's trapped in a menial job, working for the incorigible Mr. Jacks. He's crass, he's rude, and he's making Kelly miserable. The only bright spots in her life are her two loving kids, Charlie and Danielle. When Kelly comes home one night in an especially sad state, her children become concerned. So they take action. With the help of two cohorts, Charlie and Danielle teach Mr. Jacks a lesson he'll never forget!
