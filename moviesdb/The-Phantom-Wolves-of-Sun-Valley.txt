The Phantom Wolves of Sun Valley

 As the summer heat cranks up in the beautiful Sun Valley resort, so does the tension between 'wolf lovers' and 'wolf haters', with Idaho's first legal wolf hunting season quickly approaching in the fall. 'The Phantom Wolves of Sun Valley' documents the war over wolves that's taking place in the West, the result of a successful reintroduction of the species into the same area in which they were eradicated nearly a century ago. Made with the insider perspective of DeSiree' Fawn, a fifth generation native to the Sun Valley, Idaho area and NYC based filmmaker who is determined to understand the conflict over wolves and the culture war it represents.
