The Bishop's Wife

 An Episcopal Bishop, Henry Brougham, has been working for months on the plans for an elaborate new cathedral which he hopes will be paid for primarily by a wealthy, stubborn widow. He is losing sight of his family and of why he became a churchman in the first place. Enter Dudley, an angel sent to help him. Dudley does help everyone he meets, but not necessarily in the way they would have preferred. With the exception of Henry, everyone loves him, but Henry begins to believe that Dudley is there to replace him, both at work and in his family's affections, as Christmas approaches. Henry Brougham is a newly appointed Bishop and is having a difficult time raising funds for a new cathedral. His wife misses their old neighborhood in a poor part of town and he is stressed and preoccupied with his new duties. His prayers are answered when an angel, Dudley, suddenly appears in his study. Dudley tells him that he's there as his assistant and will be present until he is no longer needed. With all of his work, Brougham hasn't had much time for his wife, Julia, so Dudley keeps her company. Brougham is just a tad jealous. The main contributor to the cathedral fund, Mrs. Hamilton, has several conditions to be met before she transfers the funds and Bishop Brougham, to his dismay, is forced to compromise his principles in order to get the money. Dudley has his own way of getting her cooperation. As Christmas arrives, Dudley spins his charms ensuring a happy Christmas for everyone, particularly Julia and Henry.
