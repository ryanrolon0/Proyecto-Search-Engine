Roaring Leo Presents

 Featuring award-winning, mostly gay-themed short films, this collection includes the Sundance Film Festival hit "Encounter" by Lou Peterson, "The Process" by David Kagan, "Plastic" by Ethan Feldbau and "Wonderfluff Sandwiches" by Leah Meyerhoff. Themes include reconciling the past with the present and human connection -- creatively through the use of plastic wrap and duct tape ("Wonderfluff") and a combination of live action and animation ("The Process").
