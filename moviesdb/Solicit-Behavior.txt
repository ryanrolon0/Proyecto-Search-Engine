Solicit Behavior

 Consumers have fallen victim to the billion-dollar business of telemarketing fraud, but we know very little about the annoying phone operators who've been interrupting our precious evening hours for years. Who are they, where are they calling from, and what time do they eat dinner? Meet the employees of Telemark, where, in one Northern New Jersey call center, a bunch of local twenty-somethings and wacky suburbanites are part-time pawns in the underhanded operation of professional fundraising. This motley crew's "solicit behavior" makes every shift at Telemark a warning to vulnerable Americans.
