Railroad

 Because railroads became an important part of American history, logically the train became an important part in westerns. Many cowboy films feature a train robbery. You almost could call it a clichE. That was not in the case in C'era una volta il West, according to this documentary. The documentary compares the railroad world of this film by Sergio Leone to the actual past world of fiercely competing railroad companies.
