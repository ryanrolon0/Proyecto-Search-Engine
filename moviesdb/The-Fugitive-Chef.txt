The Fugitive Chef

 The deaths of the filmmaker Bob Fleischner, my childhood friend Jeff Tenzer and my father Marc Weisman in 1989 hastened an already made decision to leave the avant-garde art community and seek respite elsewhere. This resolution didn't alter my desire to work at filmmaking or even attempt, occasionally, to alter its known forms; it simply restated it within a different context. The Fugitive Chef is a fractured and layered personal documentary (with other genres thrown in).
