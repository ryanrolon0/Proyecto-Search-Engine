Tyger

 As the lights of a carnival midway dim, a huge tiger emerges from the dark. As it walks through the city, illuminated plants flourish in its path. It approaches a large apartment building wakes and walks to the window, sees the tiger and is transformed into a monkey. Similar transformations occur as the tiger walks through the city cars become snails, football fans become insects, hipsters outside a club become toucans. The tiger reaches a hilltop outside the city. Behind him in the city, plants glow and the air is full of flying creatures.
