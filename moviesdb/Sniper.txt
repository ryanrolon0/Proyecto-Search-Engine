Sniper

 Tough guy Thomas Beckett is a US Marine working in the Panamanian jungle. His job is to seek out rebels and remove them using his sniper skills. Beckett is notorious for losing his partners on such missions. This time he's accompanied by crack marksman Richard Miller, who's more of an office-type. Together they plan to seek out an important rebel leader, whilst avoiding a rogue marksman who frequents this part of the jungle. Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett is a sniper stationed in Panama. Although skilled, he has lost several men under his command. Beckett is teamed up with a SWAT member named Miller, who has not earned any confirmed kills, to eliminate a top Panamanian rebel leader. Tensions emerge between the two on how to conduct the mission, coupled with running into numerous challenges during the mission. A Panamanian rebel leader is meeting with his financier/drug lord. The U.S. government seeks to "disrupt" the meeting by eliminating them both. Thomas Beckett, an ace sniper stationed in the area, is sent to perform the mission. Since his spotter was killed by a mysterious mercenary sniper, he must be accompanied by Richard Miller, a SWAT trained sniper from the National Security Council who has never had a kill. The two must best the jungle and complete the mission, hindered by numerous enemy patrols, "El-Cirujano", a renegade American working for the enemy, the mysterious sniper, and the rough living in a dangerous jungle.
