The Return of the Six-Million-Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman

 Ten years after his retirement from the government, Colonel Steve Austin must again team up with Jaime Sommers to stop a terrorist group. Complicating matters for Austin are his estranged son Michael, who struggles for his father's acceptance as he graduates from flight school, and Jaime, who must cope with her and Steve's past. When Michael is severely injured in a crash, Steve must make the same decision about fitting him with bionics that he had to make with Jaime years ago after her accident. Steve Austin is approached by his former boss, Oscar Goldman to help him track down a group of criminals that he once took down. Steve is a little hesitant to do it. He is also approached by some men who know his son, Michael, who is an Air Force pilot. It seems that after his mother died, Steve has not seen him since. And it also seems that he is taking some very huge risks and his commanding officer, thinks that Steve can talk some sense into him. Steve than also meets up with his old girlfriend, Jaime Sommers, whom he has not exactly gotten over and would like to hook up with her again but is not sure if that's prudent. When his son's plane crashes, Steve offers to take the assignment, if Oscar authorizes Rudy Wells to operate on his son.
