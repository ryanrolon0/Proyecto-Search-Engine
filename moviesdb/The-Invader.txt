The Invader

 A school teacher is impregnated and kidnapped by an alien being who has been chased across the galaxy by another alien being whose race is trying to exterminate Cross's race. When the infant is born it will be female and will become the "Eve" of her race. (Females were the first to be exterminated.) But first they must reach his ship and deliver the child (full term is three days). Mancuso cons the local sheriff in his attempt to kill the mother, child and alien. Good alien from a dying race must impregnate an Earth woman to avoid extinction of his race. Bad alien whose race helped wipe out good alien's race doesn't want to see this happen.
