Satan's Cradle

 Crooked lawyer Steve Gentry ('Douglas Fowley' (qv)) has plans to take over the town and mines of Silver City from Jim Mason 'Frank Matts' (qv)). He kills Mason in what looks like a mine accident, and then brings in Lil ('Ann Savage' (qv)), who produces a fake marriage certificate and takes over Mason's property as his widow. Preacher Henry Lane ('Byron Foulger' (qv)) attempts to arouse the townspeople to drive out Gentry, Lil and their cohorts and is beaten up by a couple of the Gentry henchmen. The Cisco Kid ('Duncan Renaldo' (qv)) and Pancho ('Leo Carrillo' (qv)) encounter the preacher, and head for Silver City. They subsequently reveal Gentry's machinations, and restore Silver City to the decent town it previously was.
