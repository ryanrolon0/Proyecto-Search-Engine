Rogers and Clarke

 The Pacific Crest Trail is the jewel of America's Scenic Trails. It took nearly a century to complete and the tireless effort of some noble individuals. Warren Lee Rogers and Clinton C. Clarke were the driving force behind the completion and preservation of one of America's greatest treasures. With the inspiration of John Muir and the help of people like Ansel Adams, Rogers and Clarke carved a path through 2650 miles of magnificent wilderness with one dream - The Pacific Crest Trail.
