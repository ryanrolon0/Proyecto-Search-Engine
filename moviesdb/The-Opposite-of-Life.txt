The Opposite of Life

 Two women, on the verge of accomplishment, lives forever change when they receive the unexpected results of a pregnancy test. Seventeen year old, Ashley, is raped and tries to abort her unwanted pregnancy, but her ultra-religious parents interferes. Meanwhile Terri, a law student, fears that a child would obstruct with her career aspirations and thus considers having an abortion - much to the dismay of her husband.
