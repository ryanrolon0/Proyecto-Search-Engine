The Desperate Game

 Jim Wesley, son of a ranch owner, and Marguerite Grayson, daughter of the neighboring ranch-owner, return home from being back east in college, and the two fathers are encouraging them to get married, which will serve to solve the problem of a disputed boundary line between the ranches. But there are others who don't wish to see the dispute settled and scheme to keep the marriage from happening. Jim has to saddle up his horse, Lightning, and ride out and put an end to the land-grabbing scheme.
