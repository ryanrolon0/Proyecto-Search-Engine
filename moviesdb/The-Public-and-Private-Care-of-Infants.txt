The Public and Private Care of Infants

 A young widow with two babies is looking for work, but she cannot find a position that would allow her to care for her children. She finds a woman who is willing to take one baby into her own home and care for it. The widow then reluctantly entrusts the other baby to a public institution. Because the institution is under-staffed and under-funded, the widow's baby, like the many other children there, faces many unfortunate hazards and disadvantages.
