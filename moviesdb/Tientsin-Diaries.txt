Tientsin Diaries

 In the 1930's Westerners in Tientsin's European concessions lived an exotic adventure largely insulated from the horrors of China's civil war and Japanese occupation. Tientsin Diaries is a fictional documentary about the courtship of Misha and Natasha, whose Oriental idyll begins to unravel with the outbreak of WWII. Using actors, family photographs and newsreels, the film recreates the lost world of Russian exiles against the backdrop of the collapse of pre-revolutionary China.
