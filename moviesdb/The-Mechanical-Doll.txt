The Mechanical Doll

 In the beginning of this picture this life-size marvel of mechanism is discovered standing rigidly in the center of the room. The professor first winds up the spring on the right side of the doll, which causes a few spasmodic movements of the arms and head only. He next winds the spring on the left side, when the figure starts to run across the room and is only caught in time by the professor to prevent its colliding with the wall. The different movements of the doll are rapid and various.
