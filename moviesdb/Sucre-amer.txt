Sucre amer

 Sucre Amer tells the story of a unique court case in which an event from the past is judged by a court of history. Major figures from history are brought together in the present to re-examine the "Ignace case", about a legendary figure in the history of Guadeloupe who fought against the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte to preserve his freedom. A hero despite himself, Ignace's life and struggle were subsequently consigned to oblivion by his enemies. His treatment has left a bittersweet taste in the mouths of the people of Guadeloupe.
