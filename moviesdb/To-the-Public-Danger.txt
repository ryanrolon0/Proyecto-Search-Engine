To the Public Danger

 Four people with very different backgrounds meet by chance at an English pub and gradually become carried away in an alcohol-lubricated bout of thrill-seeking (so far as that was possible in England in the late 1940s). When their spree gets out of hand, each person faces a moral choice with lasting consequences.
