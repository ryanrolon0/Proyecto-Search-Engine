The Church of Fat Tony the Archangel

 Sentenced to death for a series of murders, Fat Tony Ramonas (a.k.a. The Archangel) mysteriously escapes from solitary confinement and secretly manufactures an experience people begin calling the "Church." The government, threatened by Fat Tony's international phenomenon, hires reluctant CIA Agent Neil Lamb to assassinate him. When the news goes out that Fat Tony is dead, Fat Tony's followers begin searching for the key that he used to open it. Tired and discouraged in the search for the key, the followers dissolve. They stray from the path of the Church's ideals. Fat Tony, assumed to be dead, steps back into the world to correct them.
