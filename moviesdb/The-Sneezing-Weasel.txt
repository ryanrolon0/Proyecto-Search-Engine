The Sneezing Weasel

 Mama hen takes her chicks out to breakfast, but little Wilbur can't get any worms. Finally, a big worm escapes, and he runs after it; meanwhile, the rest of the family has gone inside to escape a thunderstorm. Mama realizes Wilbur's missing and goes after him, just before the weasel (hidden behind a tree) gets him. He's caught a cold and is put straight to bed. Mama runs for the doctor; the weasel disguises himself as doctor Quack and the chicks open the door for him. Wilbur sneezes off the disguise and they recognize Willy the Weasel. The chicks prepare for war ammo. The weasel corners Wilbur, who sneezes in his face and gives the weasel a sneezing fit. His powerful sneezes, among other things, blow the pages out of a book, which closes to reveal the title Gone with the Wind. Wilbur finally beans the weasel. Mama returns home with the real doctor, whose castor oil scares a revived Willy off.
