The Impatient Guest

 A nicely dressed gentleman hastily enters a restaurant. He places his high silk hat on the table. As he is eating the lunch he also reads a paper. Being thirsty, he orders a syphon of vichy. A glass is filled and quickly emptied. He places the glass on the table near his hat, and while he is still reading the paper, attempts to refill the glass. Instead, he fills his hat. After finishing and tipping the waiter he dons his hat to depart. To his great surprise he pours the vichy all over himself. Facial expressions are very funny.
