Sword of Honor

 Cop partners Allen and Johnny receive a call about a robbery in progress at an art gallery where the ancient 'Sword of Honor' is being kept. They arrive in time to interrupt the theft, but in the ensuing gunfight, Allen (due to retire that same day) is killed. Vowing revenge, his partner Johnny begins his mission to hunt down the man responsible for his partner's death and bring back the stolen sword.
