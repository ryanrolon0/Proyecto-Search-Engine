Short

 Marty is very short; but he's neither nasty nor brutish, he's a genuinely nice guy, rich in friends but solitary in the game of love. Women, as he says, are over his head; he's out of their picture. Then, he meets Alison, and on a hike up a fairly steep mountain, he shows his down-to-earth courtesy, and she notices his eyes. Life, like Marty, is short. Has he met his match?
