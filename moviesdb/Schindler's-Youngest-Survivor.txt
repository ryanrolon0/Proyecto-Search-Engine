Schindler's Youngest Survivor

 Leon Leyson, the youngest person on Oskar Schindler's famous list, tells the story of his first-hand experiences during the holocaust in the camps, Schindler's factory, and beyond. In this short documentary from Lifetree Cafe, Mr. Leyson defines a true hero as an ordinary human being who does the best of things, in the worst of times, and, in 1939, during the German invasion of Poland, the times could not have been worse.
