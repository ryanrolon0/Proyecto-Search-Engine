The Rangers Step In

 Scheming Tom Martin wants to buy the Jed Warren ranch as he knows the railroad wants it for the right-of-way. Jed refuses to sell, so Martin revives an old feud between the families of Mark Allen and the Warrens by stealing Warren cattle, changing the brands and planting them in the Allen herds. The Marshal calls in the Texas Rangers. Ranger Bob Allen is related to the Allens and is in love with Jed's daughter, Terry, so Ranger Captain Thomas forbids Bob taking part in settling the conflict. Bob quits the Rangers and sets out to settle the conflict on his own. Martin uses Bob's connection to the Rangers to incite hot-headed Breck Warren. Martin, resolved to keep the feud going, has Bob kidnapped and, dressed as Bob, he kills Breck with Bob's gun. Bob escapes but Jed and Terry are the only Warrens that think he is innocent. Two buyers for the railroad, thinking Martin is the owner of the Warren place, show up and Martin has to work fast, so he and his gang ride to the Allen ranch and try to force a deal at gunpoint.
