The Tao of Pong

 Hank Houska can't get over the fact that he lost the Junior National Table Tennis Championship 15 years ago. It destroyed his life, wrecked his confidence, and shattered his dreams. When he runs into his old nemesis, King Pong, Hank vows revenge, and seeks out the one man who can coach him back to victory, the taoist master and pong-shaman, Lao Tzu. In the process of training, Hank discovers something even better than a wicked backhand - his destiny.
