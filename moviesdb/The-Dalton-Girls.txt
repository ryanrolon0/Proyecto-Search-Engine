The Dalton Girls

 After the Dalton brothers are killed off by lawmen, their female relatives take up where they left off, but armed with more dangerous weapons. The embark on a series of stagecoach robberies, bank hold-ups and picking up loose change here and there. The girls are Holly, the oldest and gang-leader; Rose, a cold-blooded killer; Columbine, who mostly wants out; and Marigold, who mostly holds the horses. A gambler, W. T. "Illinois" GRey, is on hand to bind Columbine's wounds.
