Waterboard!

 'Waterboard!' is a satire of the U.S. government's policy toward 'enhanced interrogation'. It presents the idea of waterboarding as a commercially viable means of dealing with the stresses of suburban American life. If waterboarding is not torture, then every citizen should have the right to waterboard in the privacy of his or her own home. And now with new Waterboard! they can!
