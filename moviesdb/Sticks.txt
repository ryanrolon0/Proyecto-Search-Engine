Sticks

 Sticks is an off-beat noir comedy about a smugglar of Cuban cigars who gets involved, and ultimately falls in love, with a Cuban revolutionary who's in the U.S. trading cigars for guns. The two join forces to sell a large (stolen) shipment of Castro's private label cigar, the famed "El Mariposa", and suddenly they find themselves enmeshed in the seedy underbelly of a mob-run cigar smuggling ring that's being monitored by the feds.
