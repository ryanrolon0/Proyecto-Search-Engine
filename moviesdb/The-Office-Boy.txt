The Office Boy

 Flip schemes to get himself hired as an office boy at the Screwy Nuts & Bolts factory, especially because of the attractive typist. He starts well, using a cat's tongue to lick a stack of envelopes. Before long, the cat starts chasing a mouse around the office and causing more trouble than Flip or the secretary can handle. Her dress gets caught in the duplicating machine and removed. In all the confusion, the boss arrives, and even though Flip kills the mouse (after it lands on his head), he gets fired.
