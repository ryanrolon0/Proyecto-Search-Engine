Standing on a Whale

 Artist Jorge Arrieta created an experimental film with animation centered around 55 pieces of his artwork ranging in size from 5 inches to 12 feet. Consider 913 days of creation while simultaneously working odd jobs and realize the inspiration of only one man - one artist. Let go and follow your bliss as you embark on a journey of discovery, friendship, social commentary and wonder with an artist who while struggling to paint a blank canvas realizes that life is within. Now, ask yourself, 'Are you standing on a whale fishing for minnows?'
