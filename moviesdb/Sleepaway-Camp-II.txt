Sleepaway Camp II

 Angela Baker has undergone years of therapy, electro-shock and sexual reassignment surgeries, and finally landed herself a job in the last place she should be working - camp rolling hills. She has an old fashioned approach as to how camp should be, and an old familiar deadly way of making sure that those who don't follow her rules don't get to come back next summer. Camp Rolling Hills will never be the same. Not with their newest camp counselor Angela Johnson arriving. While there once was nothing but the best summer camp ever, it's now only a killing field to her. No matter what anyone does, Angela will have a problem with it. And when this woman has a problem with someone, she's not one to try and resolve it through conversation. No, she'd rather find inventive ways to make all the campers hearts stop beating using anything necessary to accomplish her goal. As the number of campers becomes noticably slimmer, it's up to one courageous girl to try and get out of Camp Rolling Hills alive. Angela, the psychopathic transsexual from Sleepaway Camp, has escaped from a mental hospital. She's had a sex-change operation to become a woman, years of therapy, and is now a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills. Although she claims to be cured, we know that's false from the beginning. Immediately, she kills her first victim by beating her on the head with a log! Angela begins killing more teenagers when they don't follow Angela's rules. Angela Baker, from Camp Arawak, Is now Angela Johnson, a counselor at Camp Rolling Hills. She hopes that the other campers are nice and aren't getting in trouble. But not all the campers are perfectly nice, so she goes on and kills them like no other psycho has done in history of massacres, especially when she hide the bodies and tell people she sent them home!
