The Wrestler's Second

 Mongolian Man is diagnosed with mysterious disease, Yadargaa. He visits several different doctors, faith healers, and shamans in a desperate search for a cure. A group of American Medical Students follow him on his journey into the Gobi Desert. In the early 1990s, the fall of the Soviet Union left Mongolia's economy in shambles and its people searching for a way to adjust to capitalism. Mongolian doctors and traditional healers found that the prevalence of a disorder known as "yadargaa" was increasing throughout the country. Word of this disorder made its way to a team of medical anthropologists, who traveled to Mongolia to study the people affected by this illness. "The Wrestler's Second" follows Tsodol, a famous Mongolian Wrestling Coach (or Wrestler's Second), as he travels from the former Soviet controlled Mongolian capital back to the traditional nomadic life of Gobi Desert. There he searches for a cure to his "Yadargaa" and a sense of balance in a modern Mongolia. The piece was produced as an educational component in conjunction with academic research and publications on the mysterious disorder known to Mongolians as "Yadargaa".
