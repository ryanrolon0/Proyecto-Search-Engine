This African Life

 Told through the eyes of 8-year-old Sokona Keita, who reveals harsh realities of life in a West African village, even as she expresses optimism for her future. Nana Kenieba has a school and a clean well, and that makes it better off than most villages in Mali. Sokona takes the viewer on an inside tour of the town and the lives of the women and children who struggle with daily survival.
