The Sense of Things

 JOAN MARIE PARDEE is special. Her lively intelligence combined with the emotional repression she has suffered at the hands of a psychotic mother give her a unique take on life. When, aged 28, she is freed from that repression by her mother's death, Joanie goes to live with her friend and employer, LOUIE the baker, and she finally begins to blossom. Based on Alison Dye's novel, THE SENSE OF THINGS shows us Joanie's growth to self-awareness, an emotionally redemptive trail that is sometimes tragic, but more often blackly comic.
