Sword Fishing

 A group of men are on the sailboat the Scirocco heading down the Pacific coast to go fishing, but not just ordinary fishing. Among the group is archer 'Howard Hill (I)' (qv) who has used this skill in the past for big game hunting. Hill practices his archery skill by using a life preserver as a target, and by shooting flying fish gliding above the water. This practice is all in the preparation for the main target, the great blue marlin, which Hill plans on shooting with a specially rigged bow and arrow like harpoon, before the marlin is brought in by conventional rod and reel. After Hill gets to reel one in, he gives the turn to one of his less experienced crew. Regardless of if they get the fish, the act of marlin fishing is fraught with danger as the marlin tries to win the battle. A group of fisherman, including 'Howard Hill (I)' (qv), "the world's greatest archer," go in search of marlin off the California coast. With fishing line attached to his arrow, Hill plans to spear the fish, which would then be brought aboard the boat by rod and reel.
