The Song Spinner

 Young Aurora hears sounds in her head A mysterious woman comes to Shandrilan, where Silence is Golden and the Hush Law proclaims all noise forbidden. The woman turns out to be Zantalalia, a musician and singer who was banished long ago, who knew Aurora's grandfather, and who has come back to bring music once again to Shandrilan. And her first step is to give the Song Spinner to Aurora. In the kingdom of Shandrilan, winter has been growing longer and colder ever since the creation of the Hush Law (which forbids all loud noise). Then, the often considered crazy daughter of the town whisperer (Aurora) befriends a mysterious gypsy who gives her a music box. The machine will teach Aurora all the "old songs" before the sun fades away in Shandrilan, if she isn't arrested by the noise police first.
