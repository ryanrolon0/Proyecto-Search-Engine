The Wall

 A global television broadcast of the event in which former Pink Floyd leader singer and composer Roger Waters led an all-star cast in a mammoth benefit performance of his acclaimed concept album/concert, The Wall, in support of The War Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief. Set in Berlin, Germany less than a year after the destruction of the hated Berlin Wall, Waters was accompanied by disparate talents such as Cyndi Lauper, James Galway, Joni Mitchell and Albert Finney in the classic dark musical tale of a rock star's descent into madness and back. The performance was subsequently released as a top-selling video. This global broadcast, produced by Tony Hollingsworth of Tribute and reaching a television audience of 500 million in 52 countries, was based on an innovative staging of Roger Waters' seminal rock opera at the site of the Berlin Wall, watched by a live audience of 250,000. This was a show of historic proportions, with a cast of music and film stars backed by a 100-piece orchestra, the Marching Band of the Combined Soviet Forces in Germany, 150 extras and the East Berlin Rundfunk choir of 100. The cast including Albert Finney, Bryan Adams, Cyndi Lauper, Joni Mitchell, Marianne Faithfull, Roger Waters, Sinead O'Connor, Tim Curry, Ute Lemper and Van Morrison.
