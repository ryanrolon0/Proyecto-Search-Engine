Psychic Detective

 Eric Fox, a sleazebag nightclub performer, has the ability to psychically "hitch hike" in other people's minds. One night he meets Laina, a beautiful Eastern European who trains him to use his ability, in return for him investigating the mysterious suicide of her father. One of the first interactive movies, the player sees everything through Eric's eyes, and can jump at will into the minds of others. Although an average game takes 45 minutes, there is at least three hours worth of scenes that can be played out.
