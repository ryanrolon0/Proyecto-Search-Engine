Secrets of Fenville

 Secrets of Fenville is a collection of nine interwoven stories all centering around various occurrences in a fictional suburb called Fenville. Ranging from the strange to the sublime, from the frightening to the bizarre, each story has a secret to share, often with unexpected results. Nine Detroit-Area filmmakers collaborated on the film, each directing a different segment.
