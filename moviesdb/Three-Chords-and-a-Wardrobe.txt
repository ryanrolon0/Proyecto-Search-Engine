Three Chords and a Wardrobe

 Nick annoys Rachel. The whole day he does nothing more than sit in the wardrobe, alone with his guitar, composing and recording songs. Rachel is busy doing things in the household, which Nick doesn't have time for anymore. Frustrated Rachel decides to install that lamp by herself. When things go wrong and Nick shows hardly any interest, she decides to leave him and take things in her own hand. With unexpected results.
