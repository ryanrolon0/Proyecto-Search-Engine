The Shadows

 After a near fatal collision with an unknown vessel, five friends seek refuge on an island with an abandoned lighthouse. As they settle into the dilapidated old home at night, they are perplexed by peculiar noises, strange artifacts and mysterious shadows that seem to watch them. Conflicts and secrets between the friends come to the surface, straining their relationships. A frantic young Latin woman storms in warning them that pirates are coming. There is soon question as to what is real and what is surreal on this island. Before long they prepare to defend themselves when it becomes clear that these "shadows" mean to take them away.
