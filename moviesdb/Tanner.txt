Tanner

 Vic Tanner does the odd job for people who would rather not involve the police in their affairs. On his latest job, he is sent to find a woman, Lauren Bradley, who has stolen money from her employer. He is unaware however that local gangster Edward Protheroe has put a hit out on his life after Tanner foiled a robbery that Protheroe has had planned for months. Tanner is unhappy in this line of work, a business he inherited from his late father, and he feels pressured by his mentor Archie Richmond to carry on his father's legacy. But when Lauren starts asking Tanner questions about his background, Tanner begins a quest to find out what tore his family apart when he was a child, and if his Father really was the saint that everyone has made him believe he was.
