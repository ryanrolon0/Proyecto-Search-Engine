Rockin' Thru the Rockies

 The stooges are frontier guides leading a minstrel show west. When hostile Indians run the horses run off they are stranded. They must contend with a snow storm and a marauding bear as well the Indians. After almost killing each other ice fishing they solve their problems by rigging up a sail on the wagon and sailing west.
