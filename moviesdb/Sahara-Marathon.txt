Sahara Marathon

 Abdulah wants to be in top shape for the international marathon coming up soon in the refugee camp. That's why he goes out running every morning as the first rays of sun light up the refugee camps in the Sahara desert (Algeria). He knows that being placed high in the marathon would brighten up the faces of the people of Western Sahara, if only for a few hours.
