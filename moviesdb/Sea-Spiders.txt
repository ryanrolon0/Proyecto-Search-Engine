Sea Spiders

 We visit Tahiti, where small two-person boats are called sea spiders. Nature's bounty is everywhere gathering, and coconuts waiting for export. We watch the copra harvest. A child dances. Men dive for octopus. One stays down too long and must be rescued. Another's leg is grabbed by a huge clam, and he summons help with a rope tied to a sea spider where a friend sits. Calm restored, the sun sets on paradise. Life is idyllic in the tropical isle of Tahiti, where nature has bestowed a bounty of riches upon which to live. For many, it epitomizes the combination of fantasy, paradise and romance. Locals use whatever materials they have on hand for their practical everyday uses, such as making a shopping basket out of coconut palm fronds. Men learn at an early age how to climb coconut palms to gather the fruit. Against the common belief that most coconuts are consumed as food, the truth is that most are used to produce coconut oil for such uses as soap. Off the island's shores, many divers work to gather the bounty under the sea. These divers learn terrific breath control as some can stay under water for as long as three minutes without aid. Some of the perils of this work include losing consciousness from the severe deep sea water pressure, sustaining injury from the rugged underwater terrain, and getting caught in the grips of an unsuspecting creature.
