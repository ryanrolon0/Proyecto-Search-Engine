The Parson and the Outlaw

 The outlaw Billy the Kid is presumed killed by Pat Garrett. But Garrett has helped Billy fake his death, on Billy's promise to go straight and never draw his guns again. Billy meets up with gunslinger Jack Slade, who is furious to learn (he thinks) that Billy the Kid is dead, as he's devoted his career to tracking down and besting all the top gunfighters. Slade ends up working for Colonel Morgan, who runs his section of the territory with an iron hand. Billy is befriended by minister Jericho Jones, who knows his true identity. When Morgan's men ride roughshod over the townspeople, Jericho calls on Billy to strap on his guns one more time.
