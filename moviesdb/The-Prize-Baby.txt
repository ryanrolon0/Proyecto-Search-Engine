The Prize Baby

 A troupe of unemployed actors comes across a town where there's a baby contest. They dress up the fat boy as a baby and he wins the prize, but before they can leave town smallpox is discovered and the town is quarantined. When the 'baby' refuses to be vaccinated, the disguise is discovered.
