 Surprised by rain and sudden darkness Laura and Roland, a young couple hitch-hiking on an empty road, decide to seek shelter at a nearby country house. Osvald, the owner, seems to know the deeper meaning of their unexpected visit. His strange behaviour leads to an equally strange offer Osvald wants to buy Roland's wife. Laura and Roland start to play along, only to discover that their host is not kidding.
