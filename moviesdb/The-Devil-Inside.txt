The Devil Inside

 An average everyday man is driving home from long day at work only to be stopped by yet another red light. His thoughts begin to wonder as his mind "disconnects" from reality. He begins to fantasize about his surroundings. The audience is taken on a journey between reality and fiction as the stop light changes from red to green over and over.
