The Wind

 An ancient wind carries with it omens of the apocalypse, stirring the pride and envy of a group of college kids to murderous rage. Michael Mongillo's directorial debut is a lyrical, meditative film charged with sex and violence. Somewhere in USA, the young Clair manipulates her friends Mic, Billy and John, showing a letter that would be sent by Bob to her and the group cowardly beats Bob and Mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him, with tragic consequences.
