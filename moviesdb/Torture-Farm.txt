Torture Farm

 After crashing their van on a deserted country road, five young girls get a ride with kindly old man. He offers them the use of a phone back on his farm. After a slice of pumpkin pie, the girls find themselves tied up in the barn. They are forced to watch as they are tortured to death by his psychotic son, one by one in and all night orgy of murder and mayhem. The girls are mutilated and skinned alive, in what can only be described as a human slaughter house.
