Rei Zero

 Mafuyu, a young man who idolizes an author of horror novels, goes on a search for the writer and his assistants when it's reported that they disappeared while exploring an old mansion and shinto shrine in the Japanese countryside for authorial inspiration. However, Mafuyu doesn't have the chance to search for too long before he himself disappears. Miku, his younger sister, follows Mafuyu's path to the mansion in order to find him, but all she can find of him is the family's antique camera. To her dismay, she also discovers that the mansion is populated with ghosts, but her camera somehow has the power to fight them. As Miku goes further into the mansion, she slowly discovers that the mansion and shrine share a horrific past that her family may have a connection with. Frightened but determined, Miku must brave the horrors of the mansion and find her brother before she becomes the next victim.
