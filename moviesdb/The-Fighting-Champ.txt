When Brick refuses to throw the fight, Jock drugs his coffee. After Brick loses, Jock robs Nifty of the prize money and flees. Recovered from the drug, Brick takes out after him. Steele gets into a fight with a ranch foreman, knocking the foreman out. The foreman was supposed to represent the ranch in a prize fight with a middleweight champion. Now Steele finds himself in the fight of his life.
