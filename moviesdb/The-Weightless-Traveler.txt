The Weightless Traveler

 Not weighed down by possessions or a permanent home, young resourceful vagabond Bo is light; light enough to ascend. And with her, we travel to three far-away places and experience different survival challenges. With humour and creativity, she uses what others throw away and through her positive outlook and magic touch anything is possible. Without any dialog, The Weightless Traveler speaks clearly in a universal human language. Bo's travels are captured in a unique mix of wayang kulit shadow projection and a touch of modern wizardry. The intriguing, indigenous music composition adds to the enjoyment of this little cinematic gem. More is not always better, and less is not always worse (my Grandpa's wise words which inspired this story)
