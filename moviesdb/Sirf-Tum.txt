Sirf Tum

 Sirf Tum revolves around Deepak, an ordinary young man with a big heart, and Aarthi, an attractive, middle class girl. While in Dehli, Deepak finds a lost handbag belonging to Aarthi. Returning it to her, Deepak begins writing her on a regular basis. Eventually, the two fall in love. While exchanging letters, the two meet each other at random times but both have no idea who the other is. The necessary plot twist comes in the way of Neha, Deepak's boss, who falls in love with him and tries to woo him. The rest of the movie concentrates on whether Deepak rejects the advances of Neha and meets Aarthi. Do-gooder Deepak Rai (Sanjay Kapoor) comes across a stolen purse that contains educational certificates belonging to a woman by the name of Aarthi. He mails them to her, and both start to correspond with each other. Even though they have never seen each other, both feel an attraction. Aarthi's sister and brother-in-law Nirmal (Tej Sapru) are encouraging to a certain extent. While Nirmal would prefer that Aarthi marry Prem (Salman Khan), his wife wants Aarthi to chose her own life-partner. Aarthi starts out on her journey to locate and meet Deepak. But how is Aarthi to find someone, who she has never seen, nor spoken to, nor even know his whereabouts, in a big city like Delhi? And then there is Neha (Sushmita Sen), who is Deepak's boss, but has some plans of her own for Deepak, that do not involve Aarthi at all.
