Staying Out

 Staying Out follows the troubled journeys of Christie and Terry, two people leaving prison to make a new start on the outside. Terry is a thoughtful and articulate man in his mid-forties. He is released after serving eight years for armed robbery, and his journey is one of discovery, disappointment and revelation as he battles his old demons and a nagging sense of loneliness. Twenty-five-year-old Christie is determined - this time - to succeed on the outside. A reformed heroin addict, she relies heavily on the emotional support of her partner Paul. Together they hope to win back their nine-year-old son Damien, who has always lived with Paul's parents.
