Rêverie

 An elderly woman is lying on a flowery bed. She is drifting off for her afternoon nap. A fly is buzzing around. Behind the woman a mountain ridge undulates across the horizon. The scene has a Mediterranean touch. A gate opens and sleep comes. Images begin to roll out. The sky. The sea. Fluttering laundry. Bleating sheep.
