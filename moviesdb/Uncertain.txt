Uncertain

 'uncertain' presents the drowsy-dream of a teenage boy who has taken an overdose of pills to end his life. Anson, our 11-year old protagonist, is driven on an open-field road and slowly wakes up to realize he does not know where he is or where he is being taken to. Only until he speaks with a stranger in the middle of a prairie does he recall his life-altering decision, cause by the social aggressions he's suffered at school.
