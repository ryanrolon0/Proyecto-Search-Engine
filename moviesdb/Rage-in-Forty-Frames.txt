Rage in Forty Frames

 In response to the arrest of a street vendor as well as the alleged abuse and racial prejudice of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) at Precinct 115 in Queens, several human rights groups marched on the streets on May 16, 2010 to express their grievances. The marchers demanded respect for human rights, the 'reclamation' of the streets and the parks for everyone's use, and the removal of several commanding officers at Precinct 115. RAGE IN FORTY FRAMES is a collection of forty digitally-manipulated images that interprets the rage stemming out of the alleged malpractices of the police.
