Queen's Speech

 With his sister stuck in the Christmas tree like an ornament, the Angry Kid sits on the family couch, wearing white gloves and a small crown. He's preparing to tape the Queen's annual Christmas message as 1999 comes to a close. It takes more than one take for the Kid to discard his usual demeanor for that of the Monarch even then, can he pull off the entire script, or will the director have to call central casting?
