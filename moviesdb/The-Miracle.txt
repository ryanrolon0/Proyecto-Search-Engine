The Miracle

 In confession to her priest, Tekki Lomnicki, a little person, reveals how she dishonored her mother on a trip to Lourdes twenty-seven years before. In Tekki's memory, her dramatic birth, her sometimes painful relationship with her mother, Sister Thecla (a storytelling nun), Saint Bernadette, her rambunctious family, little league baseball, high school musical comedy, the romantic Paris of her dreams, and the fateful trip to Lourdes, all live again. But if she is to win a chance at redemption, Tekki will need all her courage, humor and imagination to face the truth about her life and what happened at Lourdes.
