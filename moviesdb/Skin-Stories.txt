Skin Stories

 Tattoo is an ancient art that began as a rite of passage for Polynesians, which has become a vibrant form of self-expression for people worldwide. Skin Stories explores the roots of Pacific Islands tattoo traditions, from the full-face "moko" of Aotearoa/New Zealand's Maori, to the 2,000 year-old "pe'a" of the Samoan chiefs. "Tatau" has been rescued from the brink of extinction by a new generation of artists committed to cultural survival. The documentary features traditional tattooing ceremonies, compelling interviews, and a breathtaking collection of tattoo body art from around the world.
