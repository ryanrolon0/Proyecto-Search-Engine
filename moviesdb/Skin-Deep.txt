Skin-Deep

 Vain and shallow, all Ashley wants is a sexy guy who measures up to her high physical standards. She even agrees to meet Johnny, a stranger whose promising good looks are too enticing for her to pass up. And when Johnny doesn't quite satisfy her expectations, Ashley wastes no time in turning him down and finding a more suitable partner. While a jealous and enraged Johnny looks on, a handsome man approaches Ashley and uses his charm to lure her back to his place. But will Ashley's empty judgment of character prevail? Or is she destined to become the victim of her own superficiality?
