Shoreditch Sonata

 East London; the present. Twenty-something part-time actress Faye is introduced to Charlie, a handsome friend-of-a-friend, after a warehouse party. Charlie offers her a drink from his bottle of whiskey. The two find shelter in a run-down industrial courtyard, but the potentially romantic encounter is cut short by an unexpected phone call.
