Springtime in Texas

 Pete Grant controls the town of Pecos and it's Mayor and Marshal. When Jimmy, Denny, and Lasses arrive they soon find themselves in trouble. Already suspected of murder, Jimmy and Denny catch two of the three men that rob the Express Office only to find themselves framed for the robbery. Posing as a woman, Lasses breaks them out and they head after the third man who is the one that can clear them.
