The Old Grey Hare

 Elmer wonders if he'll ever catch the rabbit; the voice of God takes him through a flash-forward to the year 2000. Elmer is equipped with a rocket-launcher rifle, but he's no smarter. He shoots Bugs, who shows him a photo album with baby pictures. We see a sequence of Bugs and Elmer as babies. Elderly Bugs digs his own grave and tricks Elmer into getting in. Frustrated at never getting the rabbit, Elmer Fudd cries out to his God, who responds (much to Elmer's reply). God takes Elmer far into the future, to 2000 A.D. where Elmer is an old man chasing an old Bugs. With the new weaponry available, Elmer fatally wounds Bugs, sparking a trip down memory lane to when they were both children and the chase began.
