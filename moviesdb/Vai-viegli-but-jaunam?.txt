Vai viegli but jaunam?

 A documentary of numerous stories of young people, living in Soviet Latvia. These are mainly stories of different youngsters, viewed differed by Soviet society and local pro-soviet government - punks, those who demolished the train after the legendary local rock band 'Perkons' concert, for that being regarded as public enemies, a mortuary worker and more. Different lives, different expectations, for some lack of freedom and pressure from the government and fear. One of the rare documentaries that can be so touching, because it's so true.
