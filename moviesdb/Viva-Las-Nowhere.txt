Viva Las Nowhere

 Somewhere in Kansas, Frank operates the Middle O'America Motel and dreams of opening a club where he'll sing his country songs. His wife Helen is disparaging, so when a scheming chanteuse is dumped by her loutish husband on Frank's front door, Frank is bewitched. In short order, though, the visitor (Julie) has dispatched Helen, set in motion a con for Frank's money, called her husband to come get her, and taken Frank's army buddy (just arrived for a visit) into the bathtub for some fun. Soon Frank is in over his head, just as Helen's twin sister comes for a visit and Julie's husband arrives looking for his wife. Is there any way out of this situation (and out of Kansas) for Frank?
