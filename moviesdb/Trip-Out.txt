Trip Out

 Have you ever had a bad trip? In this stark black comedic tale, three adolescent boys and one sinfully attractive cheerleader will embark on a hallucinogenic journey that will lead them nowhere beneficial. Tommy, an unusually extroverted, exaggerated loner is pitted against his ridiculously popular older brother, Richard, while Richard's friend Colby buzzes around them both. Spicing things up at a rapid rate, Sasha, head cheerleader and domineering goddess, plans a party with the most sexual of intentions, unintentionally causing an insanely outlandish chain reaction in the process. From vindictive drug dealers and dreamlike scenarios, to the possibility of murder, anything is feasible. Functioning like a fever dream, with exaggerated archetypes, Trip Out shatters the mold of traditional high school films and reshapes it into something not easily forgotten. In a high school in the suburbs, the teenager Richard is very popular, good student and successful with the women. His younger brother Tommy is weird, outcast and jealous of Richard, and his best friend is the aggressive Colby Francis, who is hated by the other students and speaks like the rapper Eminem. When the slut cheerleader Sacha decides to have sex with Tommy, she invites the trio of friends for a party at her home. Colby buys mushroom from the drug dealer Brent and after sniffing cocaine with Richard, he prepares a cocktail with the dope. Richard, Tommy and Colby drink the mushroom and have a bad trip with tragic consequences.
