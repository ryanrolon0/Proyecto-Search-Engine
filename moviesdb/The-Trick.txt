The Trick

 A giant Rubik's cube sits ominously on a midtown Manhattan sidewalk. When a woman passing by investigates, a small Rubik's cube puzzle mysteriously pops out of the larger cube. As the woman twists the puzzle, reality warps around her and she finds herself trapped inside the giant cube with a strange magician. When she can't answer his bizarre riddles, the magician scrambles her body up among the faces of the cube using the smaller Rubik's cube puzzle. Hearing the woman's screams, a couple on the street approach and they too are sucked inside. The magician scrambles up all three strangers, their body parts intermingling with each other. They manage to steal the magician's Rubik's cube and attempt to 'solve' themselves and return to normal whole people. But when restoring their bodies doesn't do anything, they realize that the answer is to solve a different puzzle; only through collaboration and the merging of their bodies does the magician allow them to escape.
