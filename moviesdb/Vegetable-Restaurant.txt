Vegetable Restaurant

 A couple sitting at an Italian restaurant orders their meal. The film then switches to an animated segment about a pair of tomatoes sitting sitting in a restaurant staffed entirely by other vegetables. A dinner show begins, starring a motorcycle-riding squash who does stunts such as flattening a giant lump of dough and covering it in grated cheese. The tomatoes enjoyment turns to horror as they realize that he's making a giant pizza, and that they are about to become the next ingredient.
