The Panza Monologues

 Recorded in 2008 in front of a live audience in East Los Angeles, The Panza Monologues is an original performance piece based on women's stories about their panzas. Tu sabes - that roll of belly we all try to hide. Conceived from kitchen table conversations and chisme and compiled from interviews of Chicanas of all ages, places, and spaces, these stories create a quilt of poignancy, humor, and revelation. Performed in monologue format and riffing on Eve Ensler's play The Vagina Monologues, The Panza Monologues boldly places the panza front and center as a symbol that reveals the lurking truths about women's thoughts, lives, loves, abuses, and lived conditions. Featuring live musical accompaniment the super group Los Flacasos.
