Sharing the Light

 Sharing the Light documents the International Conference of Jewish Women held in Kiev, Ukraine in 1994. Project Kesher, founded by Sallie Gratch in 1989, organized this conference to "build a bridge between West and East, a bridge between two Jewish worlds...." Participants came from around the globe to share a common dream and to help rebuild Jewish life in the former Soviet Union. Through workshops and seminars, the women learned and explored their Judaism and Jewish culture so that they could return to their own communities and begin building a stronger sense of Judaism's rich heritage.
