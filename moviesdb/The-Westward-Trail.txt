The Westward Trail

 Ann and Tom Howard arrive from the east to take up ranching. But Tom wants to return and forges his sister's name to the deed and sells it to Larson. Eddie knows there is silver ore in the area and that Lawson, who killed the Sheriff, is out to get all the ranches. When Lawson appoints himself the new Sheriff, Eddie organizes the ranchers to fight Lawson and his men. Ann Howard and her brother, Steve, purchase a ranch in Prairie City, but unknown to them a rich vein of silver ore runs through the property and a gang of outlaws, led by the town's crooked sheriff, plot to get the land. Tom, the weakest character ever seen in a B-western, is none too thrilled with the wild west and wants to go back east. The sheriff talks him into forging his sister's name to a deed which he thinks he can sell to the sheriff. But the sheriff has other plans, takes the deed, refuses to pay Tom for it and is holding the forged document as a blackmail threat. Eddie Dean, an undercover federal agent, and his partner, "Soapy" Jones, learn of the underhanded deal and decide to straighten things out.
