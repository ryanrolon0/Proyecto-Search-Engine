 Norbert has worked for forty years in Africa. When he returns to Canada, it's despite himself and without papers. Now Norbert has only one goal be deported back to Africa at all costs. He plans to stow away on a cargo ship headed for Africa. But he must get rid of Trotsky, his pet monkey. He has no choice but to abandon the small primate in a park... and hope that someone will pick him up.
