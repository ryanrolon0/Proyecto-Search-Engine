That's My Wife

 Oliver stands to inherit a large fortune from his rich Uncle Bernal, with the condition that he be happily married. But when Mrs. Hardy walks out just before Uncle Bernal is due for a visit, Stanley is pressed into duty (and into drag) to impersonate Oliver's loving spouse. He's convincing enough to earn a pass or two from a drunk at a nightclub, but when a stolen necklace gets dropped down his dress, attempts to recover it disclose Stanley's true gender.
