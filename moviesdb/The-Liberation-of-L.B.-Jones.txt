The Liberation of L.B. Jones

 A gloomy vision of the possibility of decent relations between whites and blacks anywhere, including the South. Undertaker L.B. Jones, the richest black man in his county of Tennessee, is divorcing his wife for infidelity with a white policeman. Taking a stand against racism, he is greeted with a hostile bunch of Southern bigots and other various stereotypes. Written by Sterling Silliphant ("In the Heat of the Night"). Director William Wyler's final film. L.B. Jones is a well-to-do African-American funeral director who comes to Oman Hedgepath's firm in search of legal representation. Jones wishes to divorce his young wife Emma, but his grounds make the case a hot news-Jones has learned Emma has been having an affair with Willie Joe Worth, a white police officer who is the father of Emma's unborn child. Hedgepath fearing that the revelations of a public divorce trial will rock the race conscious town. He has a private conversation with Worth, hoping to settle the matter quietly out of court. In doing so, Hedgepath ignites a course of events more devastating than any divorce trial could have produced. Worth does not want his affair dragged into a court of law, so he and his fellow officer Stanley Bumpas violently take matters into their own hands.
