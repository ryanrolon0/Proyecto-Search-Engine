Shoenanigans

 A cobbler elf comes to a shoe shop late in the night to create beautiful footwear. Though his intention are good and his actions eccentric, he falls victim to a box of chocolates left out on the table. Unbeknownst to him, the chocolate sweets are alcoholic, and after indulging his sweet tooth he finds himself unable to continue his shoe-making, and instead makes a terrible mess.
