Vicente

 Vicente is a 17 years old teenager with Asperger's Syndrome (a neurological condition in the autism spectrum, but not as severe). Beacause of this, his life and his family's has been complicated. Today, more mature than he was in his troubled childhood, Vicente sees a pastime and a passion in video-gaming. Through the testimony of close family and immersion in his everyday life, we discover little by little Vicente's world. Guided by his brother--the director of this documentary--through a humane and intimate camera intent on seeking detail, we're able to see the real Vicente, the one that can't be seen from a distance. Will Vicente be able to see himself?
