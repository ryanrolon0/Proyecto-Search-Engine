 The story takes place in a retro-futuristic view of London where tin robots are commonly seen working with man. After a comet hits the earth all technology mysteriously stops working. London is plunged into the dark ages. With no machines, no robots, no electricity, not even working cars, the people flee the city in search of a place unaffected by the mysterious comet. London is left empty and quiet for many years until today, when the old tin robots suddenly wake up!
