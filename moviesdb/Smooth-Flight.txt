Smooth Flight

 Dreams of the Soviet Union dream of winning the lottery, working for the European Union, going to New York City and making tons of money. But for some, their dreams turn into nightmares and even the lucky ones find the streets of America aren't paved in gold. An entertaining look at work and travel abroad aimed at teens in the Baltic states who can make a choice and protect themselves from labor abuses. Top pop and rock musicians Linda Lean, Agnes and Gustavs, and The Hobos' Rolands Uldris lend music, wit and commentary.
