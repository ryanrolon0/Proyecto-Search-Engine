 Samuel is an arrogant skeptic who has been compiling his own book of wisdom all his life. After his girlfriend dumps him he travels to Asia to donate it to a Buddhist Temple. There he finds they already have old but identical books from previous generations. He realizes he's been reincarnated many times and cursed to re-live the same life until he learns the most crucial lesson that is never in his book.
