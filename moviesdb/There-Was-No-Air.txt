There Was No Air

 In a world where there is no landscape, only darkness, a tribe comprised of the last remaining humans discovers their earthly origins after unearthing an omniscient glowing orb. They present this creation myth as a dance to entertain a small group of children. Beginning with an interpretive dance about lava and the gasses of the early atmosphere, The Discoverer of the glowing orb proceeds to teach the children a lesson on illuminated jellyfish and funny-looking sea anemones. But The Discoverer is burdened with an overwhelming sadness at the loss of these natural wonders. In her exhaustion, she faints, and then travels back in time through her dreams to witness the destruction of the planet. She returns to small comforts from the tribe's resident Wise Man. This mytho-poetic story is a musical lamentation for losses suffered in humankind's delusional battle against the indifferent forces of nature.
