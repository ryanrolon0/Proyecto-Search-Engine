The Invisible Link

 The invisible link that power's Austria's industry, cities and farms is, of course, electric power. Ultimately that power means jobs for the nation's many unemployed. Kaprun Dam, in the mountains north of Salzburg - Austria's largest - and some 20 others will provide more electricity than ever before, thanks to Marshall aid. Stunning footage shows how one family farms in the high mountains, with and without benefit of electricity.
