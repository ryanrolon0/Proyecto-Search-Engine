The Violent Ones

 When a girl in a town that's populated by Hispanics is attacked, the only thing she says before falling into a coma is that her attacker is an outsider, a Caucasian. So the sheriff arrests the only outsiders there are. All he can do is hope that one of them will admit to being the attacker or that the girl can wake up long enough to identify him. But at the same time her father is preparing a lynch mob. So it's only a matter of time.
