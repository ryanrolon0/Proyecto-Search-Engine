Sister Sarah's Sky

 Sarah is a misunderstood 14-year-old from a conservative Connecticut family who rebels by secretly studying Marxism. She spends the summer in California with her Bohemian aunt, uncle, and their eccentric artist friends and gets a different perspective on life. Through a series of letters home, Sarah establishes the long-missing emotional connection with her parents. A movie filled with original music, dancing, and surreal dream sequences. The Orange County Register said in a review of the film "Although rated G, Sister Sarah's Sky delivers an artful and intelligent comedic look at everything from communism and capitalism to meditation and the music industry. The film also takes a surprisingly deep look at the forces that can divide and reunite families."
