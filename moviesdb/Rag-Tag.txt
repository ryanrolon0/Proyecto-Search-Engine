Rag Tag

 Raymond and Tagbo met when they were eight. Although from radically different worlds - Raymond/Rag is from a single parent West Indian home, while Tagbo/Tag is the only son of middle class Nigerian parents - they remain inseparable until the cusp of their teens, Social Services take Rag from London. Ten years later, Rag returns to find Tag. They still want to be together. But now twenty-three, their need has shifted into something more urgent and consuming. Other things have changed too. Tag is just finishing law school and discovering how hard it is to find a position. Tag also has a white girlfriend, and since her impressive credentials aren't even good enough for Tag's father, Rag doesn't stand a chance. Rag sees even less room for himself in Tag's life when Tag's friend Olisa flies into London. Young, rich and shady, Rag knows Olisa is trouble. When Rag and Tag are invited to Nigeria for Olisa's Chieftaincy ceremony, Rag is determined to save Tag from his machinations. In this tale of family, friendship and love, everyone has to discover a definition of what these things mean to them. Then stake their future on it.
