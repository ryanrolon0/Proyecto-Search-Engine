The Girl from Paradise

 Jack Hansen (played by Frank Luther) is an unappreciated chef in NTG's Paradise Restaurant. He thinks his sweepstakes ticket is a winner, so his boss (Mr. Granlund) promotes him to co-owner. Hansen's girl friend Sally (played by Miss Froos) steps in when the restaurant's star singer quits. It turns out Hansen did not win the sweepstakes, but he got to sing a few songs.
