The Call of the Hummingbird

 In central Brazil, a ragtag of group of 1000 permaculture experts, Rastafarians, alternative health practitioners, 13 Moon Calendar Followers and NGO executives work towards a do-it-yourself action plan to make the world a better place in 13 days. But who is going to deal with the garbage? Welcome to "Survivor" for social change addicts where consensus is the only way to make decisions. Anyone can speak. For as long as they like about whatever they want. And they do. Out of the 400 who volunteered, only a quarter actually show up to work. But despite the seemingly unwieldy process, consensus slowly builds, dialogue happens, the garbage is dealt with and attitudes shift. The film's fascinating characters take us on a journey that covers terrain from the practices of permaculture and consensus facilitation all the way to the meaning of the Mayan calendar, which mysteriously ends in 2012 - just a few short years away. In the process we are introduced to new ideas about politics, nature and even time itself. Call of the Hummingbird is a fascinating exploration of new paradigm thinking about organizing for social change.
