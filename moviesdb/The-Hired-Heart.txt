Despite the best efforts of her father in law to marry her off to the local eligible bachelors, she still remains so. The week-long county fair is approaching and her father in law traps her into an unfair deal involving the feeding of her bull and her attendance at the fair with a suitable escort. She decides to call his bluff by hiring a male escort to attend the fair as her lover. However, things don't go quite according to plan as he smells a rat and investigates the new boyfriend and even worse the escort starts to fall in love with her! Things come to a head at the Bison Hall dance, the highlight of the fair, when the girlfriend of the escort arrives in town and the escort forces her into making a choice between him and her dead husband Michael!
