The Elephant & the Dragon

 'All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.' Composed of a song, media headlines and photos, archive documents and images, and filmed sequences to underline the lyrics, this 'singing pamphlet' is a contemporary take on George Orwell's words from Animal Farm. It travels between the British Empire of old and the aging and assisted society that is Europe today. Between the exploited India and humiliated China of the 19th century and the global economic powerhouses they are now. And from America-Superpower to America-Soon-To-Be-Number -?. A cast of elephants, tigers, dragons, rats, pigs, eagles, sheep, and a host of other animals play out this allegory of a New World Order where a youthful and work-hungry Asia is taking over the Farm.
