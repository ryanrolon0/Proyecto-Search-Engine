The Mover

 The "Mover" is an off the radar courier for the underworld. No name, no home, no family or ties. He lives alone on the road transporting valuables around and out of the country in his car. When word comes down to partner up with the much less low profile and professional "Driver" for a high risk job the Mover begins to suspect he is being set up by his own bosses as the police and a mysterious hit man begin to take an interest in him.
