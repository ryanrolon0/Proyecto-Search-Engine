Wally and Zip

 Wally is happily conducting a very serious piece of music until Zip steals the spotlight with his baton and launches the orchestra into a ridiculous march. The film is a silly back and forth fight between these two characters for control of the orchestra. Wally is usually a very dignified walrus, but he becomes so angry at the take-over he breaks Zips baton. Zip uses his silliness and speed to win in the end.
