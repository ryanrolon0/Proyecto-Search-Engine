Rhodes nostalgie

 Rhodes Forever is a contemporary portrait, weaving imaginary family ties between the Jews of Rhodes and their offsprings. Despite the physical destruction of their community during World War II, they managed to transplant and recreate their unique sephardic Jewish culture elsewhere, notably in Africa, in the Belgian Congo, and later in Belgium.
