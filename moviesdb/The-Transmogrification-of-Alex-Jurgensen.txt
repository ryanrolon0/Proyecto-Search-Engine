The Transmogrification of Alex Jurgensen

 Alex Jurgensen does what any normal person does. He wakes up, he eats a meal, and he goes to work. His life is normal. Too normal, eerily normal... When one morning, as Alex is doing as any normal person does, he comes face to face with a mirror and encounters not his reflection, but his alter, who intends to drive him all the way through the looking glass.
