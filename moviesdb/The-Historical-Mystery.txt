The Historical Mystery

 A quick recounting of the coming of the Mormons to Utah and, more specifically, what would become Salt Lake City. The trials and tribulations of the settlers are shown, and after they have raised a bountiful wheat crop, a great horde of locusts sweep down and threaten to destroy the crop. Then, as if by a miracle, an enormous flock of seagulls appear, and devour the locusts.
