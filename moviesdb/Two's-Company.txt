 A woman has a relationship with a blind man, but is cheating on him. When the blind man calls he's coming back in 15 minutes, the woman tries to get David, her secret lover, out of the bed and the house before he is back. But David doesn't seem to be in a hurry. When finally she has worked him out of the door, he just simply returns by saying he needs to tidy up the house. Since time is running out, she has no choice but to let him in. When the blind man has returned and the woman is out for some groceries, David decides to start teasing the blind man.
