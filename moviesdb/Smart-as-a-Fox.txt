Smart as a Fox

 We watch a fox cub's early life still small and its mother away looking for food, it has a close call with an attacking raven. Another day, a dog attacks and the cub's mother draws the dog's attention to her own peril. The cub is saved from starvation by its father's return to the burrow. Again, dogs attack and the fox father draws them away; how can he escape? Later, the cub gets lost and spends a night in the woods. Has an owl found prey?
