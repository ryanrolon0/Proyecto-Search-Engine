The Facts of Life Down Under

 Blair, Tootie, Natalie, Jo, Beverly Ann, and Andy visit the land down under. Blair and Jo are warned of a planned jewel heist; Beverly Ann visits a beau from many years ago; Natalie is stranded in the outback; and Tootie meets a Yale student who pretends to be a young Aborigine. Blair, Jo, Tootie, Beverly Ann, and Andy accompany Natalie to Australia, who is going to make a speech in the Australian counterpart of their school. Blair and Jo meet a guy who claims to be a policeman and entrusts them with something that he says is evidence against a criminal whom he says is approaching them. Later that guy breaks into their room and they knock him and they discover that he is a policeman and he tells them that the man they were talking to is a jewel thief who stole an opal but did not have it with him when they searched him. So he suspects that he gave it to them. While they are skeptical as to who is telling the truth, they play along until they can find out who is telling the truth. And besides they don't have it, it's in Natalie's backpack, who went out into the bush and is lost but a guy finds her and takes care of her. Tootie meets an Aborigine or so she thinks. And Beverly Ann meets an old love.
