Summer of the Sharks

 Summer of the Sharks is an inside look at the lives of professional shark divers on the road, doing what they do best; chasing sharks and having fun. Along the way they face the harsh and exciting realities of this sport; ocean storms, aggressive sharks, close quarters, and the startling discovery of their beloved sharks being brutally killed - with a first ever, up-close look at shark fisherman. Summer of The Sharks was made to help promote eco-activism by showing a positive side to sharks and showing what's happening to them rather than "preaching" from an interview stand point. The road trip was a simple idea; dive the best shark spots in the world, and live out their own endless summer.
