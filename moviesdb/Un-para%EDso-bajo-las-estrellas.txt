Un paraíso bajo las estrellas

 Like her mother before her, beautiful Sissy wants to be a dancer at the Tropicana, Havana's famous cabaret. But her truck driving father, Candido, forbids her to do so because of his ongoing grudge against Armando, his former rival and choreographer at the nightclub. When Candido and his friend Promedio accidentally run Sergito over, Promedio sees the star-shaped mole on the boy's buttock, identical to Candido's. Much to Sissy's delight and to Promedio's dismay for fear of incest, Candido takes the boy home, unaware that Sergito is his son and therefore Sissy's brother. Promedio's worries are confirmed when the two youngsters fall madly in love.
