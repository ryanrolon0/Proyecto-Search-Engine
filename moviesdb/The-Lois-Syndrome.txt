The Lois Syndrome

 While investigating the evil Baroness, a lovely reporter is captured after discovering the villainess' evil plans. The Baroness leaves the reporter bound and gagged, kidnaps three other lovely ladies and orders a secret operative known only as "The Enigma" to join forces with her, or the hostages will come to a horrible end.
