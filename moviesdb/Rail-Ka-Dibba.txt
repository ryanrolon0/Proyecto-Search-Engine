Rail Ka Dibba

 A heart-warming tale of good samaritanism. A poor but large-hearted young man gives shelter to three helpless, forlorn people in his home - an abandoned railway coach. However, tensions arise in the group when he marries one of the inmates, a young, destitute girl, since his friend (one of the other inmates) loves her too. The group breaks up and the coach is abandoned. Time passes, fortunes turn and penitence brings the group back together.
