Terminal Interface

 After one night of drunk driving on the information superhighway, hot shot journalism grad student Byron Thaxter gets in over his head. He witnesses a murder, finds horrifying truths about his university's financial aid program, and becomes the focus of a web based conspiracy to keep him silent. The more he learns, the more mysterious forces torment him by cancelling his credit, his utilities, and now cable will only send him C-span II. Then, they get vicious. Perhaps the answer lies in the mysterious man in black who has been following him for days, or the strange informant known only as MooseCap, or perhaps it lies in the secrets of a mysterious and beautiful redhead who sweeps into his life just as it is collapsing around him.
