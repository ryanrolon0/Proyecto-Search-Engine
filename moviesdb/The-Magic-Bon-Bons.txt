The Magic Bon Bons

 A Boston girl, Clairbel Sudds, laments that she has no talents and goes to Dr. Daws, something of a wizard, for help. He gives her five magic bon bons, each a different flavor for a different talent. They are accidentally sold to a 12 year old girl named Bessie Bostwick, whose family eats them with bizarre results.
