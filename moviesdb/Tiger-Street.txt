Tiger Street

 After Tae Kwon Do master Tiger Sun escapes from his unjust prison sentence in Korea, he travels to Denver, Colorado, where he meets with old friend, Ray Carver. Carver is a science teacher at an inner-city high school where excessive drug use, gang activity and violence plague his students on a daily basis. After one of Carver's students commits suicide in the classroom, Carver realizes that he must try something new. He reaches out to Tiger Sun and convinces him to teach a Tae Kwon Do class at the school. Though Sun struggles with the memory of his Korean students, many of whom were tortured and killed for their study of the martial art form, he decides to teach again after he and Carver are confronted with opposition from local gang lords. When one of the school's major drug dealers takes Tiger Sun's class and changes as a result, his drug dealing partner becomes extremely upset and persuades the drug lord to eliminate Tiger. After the drug lord makes several attempts to kill Tiger, he finds himself face to face... in the ring. Will Tiger beat the drug lord and maintain the progress made against the school's war on drugs, or will the evil drug lord prevail?
