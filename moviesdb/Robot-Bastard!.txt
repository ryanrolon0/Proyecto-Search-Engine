Robot Bastard!

 Robot Bastard is a robotic government operative with a bad attitude. His latest mission is to go into space rescue the President's daughter Catherine from the clutches of a sinister kidnapper on his heavily guarded satellite. When he gets there, he encounters the usual action-adventure foes and thrills, relying on his intellect and multiple gadgets to make it through the maze-like satellite and rescue Catherine, but even he's surprised at the challenges he didn't expect.
