The Russian Bride

 Christopher, a middle-aged man who is obsessed with repairing old radios, marries the Russian bride Natasha. She comes to live with him and his mother Dora in his London house. Dora instigated the marriage in order to have someone look after her son when she dies. Natasha is bored as Christopher takes no sexual interest in her, and she is treated as a servant. Eddie, an out-of-work actor, stirs up the household when he befriends Christopher and Dora, in order to seduce Natasha.
