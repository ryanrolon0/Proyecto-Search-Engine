Small Killing

 Ruth is fifteen. Unlike her best friend Donna she doesn't like to party much. To her Life doesn't seem to offer as much excitement as one would expect. When she meets Edwin, a new fellow student at her school, that is about to change. After having stolen a gun from his father, the two imagine what it would feel like to kill someone. Ignoring every warning Ruth takes her fantasies further and further until even Edwin doesn't want to keep up with her anymore. Only after acting out in violence against her best friend and (almost) killing someone she finally makes a decision for life.
