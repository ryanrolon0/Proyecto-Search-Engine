Therapeutic Justice

 The film focuses on the drug court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, a remarkable program that has rehabilitated hundreds of non-violent drug offenders. It is one of the most successful drug courts in the U.S. and the only one with a regular TV show. The film tells the story of drug court from the perspective of Judge Mary Ann Gunn, the program's charismatic leader, and from the perspective of several participants, including former NFL player Matt Jones. The audience sees the inner-workings of drug court and even witnesses one drug court session held inside a middle school. Despite its success, the program is in danger of being terminated if it does not receive much-needed funding from the state.
