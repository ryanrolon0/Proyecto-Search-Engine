 Life changes like the tide, in accordance with the whole universe but you. It only takes one second, one place, one person, it can happen anytime, even now, the 4th of April at 5pm. Smile of April, it's five stories, fives lives, five destinies linked by this specific moment. ANGIE & ADRIAN; She pinky-swore with her best friend that she would never get married. ANN, PAUL & CHARLY; She just wanted to buy new plants, when everything went black. SARAH, JACK & LORI; It was a simple science project... if only she had asked someone else for their help... HELEN & JOHN; He needed milk. VICKY & KYLE; It happened the 4th of April, the day she changed their lives.
