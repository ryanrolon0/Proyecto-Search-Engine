To Have & to Hold

 Jack lives in the jungle of New Guinea where his woman, Rose, gets killed. After two years, he meets the author Kate in Melbourne who looks very similar to the late Rose. They fall in love and he persuades her to follow him into the jungle. Their relationship gets worse as Jack is haunted by Rose while he drinks a lot and watches old video films about her. Kate asks the locals about the mystery around Rose but gets no satisfying answer. Jack begins to project Rose on Kate by making her wear one of Rose's dresses and copying Rose's hair style. Kate wants to flee but can't find her passport which Jack has taken away from her. The struggle becomes a matter of live and death.
