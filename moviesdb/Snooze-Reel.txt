Snooze Reel

 A burlesque of a movie newsreel as it kids some typical events that were happening at the time; Gloria Gorgeous christens a new ocean-liner which promptly sinks; and a 200-foot high statue of Longfellow is unveiled. It winds up by introducing a new singing cowboy, who promptly tells the audience to 'follow the bouncing ball" and sing "Jimgle, Jangle, Jingle" along with him. Some audiences did, and some didn't.
