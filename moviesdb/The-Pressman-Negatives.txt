The Pressman Negatives

 A narrative film that explores issues of time and memory. It is the story of jewelry thief Sidney Pressman, his cohorts in crime and the dark world they inhabited in a Midwestern city during the 1970s. Through photographic snapshots -- allegedly taken by him -- it documents the final days of Pressman and his criminal colleagues, brought together for one last heist.
