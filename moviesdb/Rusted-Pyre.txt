Rusted Pyre

 In an abandoned car on the outskirts of town, 15 year old and straight laced Ginny watches Sally burn herself with a cigarette. She tries to save her from the downward spiral, but things go awry when she discovers how far lost Sally already is to the abyss and must get out before she gets caught for the same ride.
