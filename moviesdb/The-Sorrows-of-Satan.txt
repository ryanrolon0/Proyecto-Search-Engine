The Sorrows of Satan

 Geoffrey, a young and impoverished writer, is desperately in love with Mavis, who lives at his boardinghouse and is also pursuing a writing career. Unable to marry her because of his poverty, in his anger he curses God for abandoning him. Soon Geoffrey meets Prince Lucio de Rimanez, a wealthy, urbane gentleman who informs Geoffrey that he has inherited a fortune, but that he must place himself in the Prince's hands in order to enjoy the fruits of his inheritance. What Geoffrey doesn't know is that Prince Lucio is actually Satan, who is using Geoffrey as an experiment to show God that he can corrupt anybody. Satan is flung from a high rampart of Heaven by the Angel host, headed by Michael with his flaming sword, and sent hurtling to earth and bringing temptation to the sons and daughters of men. In the modern day he appears as the polished, witty, elegant Prince Lucio de Rimanez,working his evil in great English baronial castles, London's wild Bohemia, the fashionable night clubs of Piccadilly, in the artist's garrets, and the revelry resorts of the rich. And uses struggling-writer Geoffrey Temptest to exhibit his power to show he has the ability to corrupt the incorruptible.
