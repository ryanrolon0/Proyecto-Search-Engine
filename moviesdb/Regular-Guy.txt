Regular Guy

 Bill Rubin is a lonely New York bachelor who refuses to believe that his chronic intestinal issues are serious. At the behest of his girlfriend, Anne, he begrudgingly visits a proctologist, whose bedside manner is less than compassionate. Rather than use the doctor's visit to wake himself to reality, Bill launches into a frenzy of escapist behavior. He deludes and distracts himself with ideas for useless inventions and wild fantasy road trips. Ultimately Bill is left to decide between facing the reality of his terminal prognosis with Anne at his side or be left alone with his delusions.
