Stick It

 Haley Graham is a former gymnast-turned-juvenile delinquent whom, after one too many run-ins with the law, is forced to enroll at an elite gymnastics academy, the VGA in Houston, Texas which is run by the legendary Olympic gymnast Burt Vickerman. But the rebellious Haley is not welcomed into the academy by the other teenage gymnasts whom despise her for walking out on her Junior Olympic team years earlier during a competition which cost them the gold medal. But Haley is not a docile person either and makes every effort to provoke conflicts with the other girls. Vickerman takes it upon himself to coach Haley in his own way to make her regain her self respect for the VGA's coming spot on the Gymnastic Nationals. Haley Graham is an ex-elite gymnast who, after being on the wrong side of the law just one too many times, she is sent to her idea of juvy - VGA, a.k.a with lots obstacles including, soda throwing Haley-haters, up-tight ex-fellow gymnasts, EXTREMELY pushy parents and a whole bunch of wedgie causing leotards. Along with her crazy, skater friends, Frank and Poot, she turns the gymnastic world upside down with her rebellious ways and rockin' routines. The film tells you that anyone, I mean ANYONE, can bend the rules just a little bit. (cough cough.)
