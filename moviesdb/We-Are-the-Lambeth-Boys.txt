We Are the Lambeth Boys

 Part of the British 'Free Cinema' movement, which included Lindsay Anderson's 'Every Day Except Christmas' (daily life at Covent Garden fruit/vegetable market) and 'O Dreamland' (a working-class trip to Margate amusements), and Reisz and Tony Richardson's 'Momma Don't Allow' (about a London jazz club) all made in the mid to late 1950s, before the three went on to direct features in the British 'new wave' social realist genre that drew from their experiences in Free Cinema. Seminal piece of documentary film by New Wave director Karel Reisz follows the daily activites of members of the Lambeth Youth club in late 1950's London.
