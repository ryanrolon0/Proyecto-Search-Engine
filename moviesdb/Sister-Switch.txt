Sister Switch

 Sister Switch is the story of what happens when a shy, prim and proper 11 year old brainiac switches bodies, through the use of a scientific potion created by her father, with her outgoing 18 year old sister who happens to be the reigning princess of R&B music. And to make matters worse, her mother is a former teen star pushing the older sister into the music business. Needless to say the results are hilarious.
