The Lonely Lights. The Color of Lemons.

 A visual study of a young jogger who is shown a series of inkblot paintings that propel him into a collection of stories and memories centered on childhood, questions of sexuality and an enigmatic girl. The film is structured around eight of these painting each paired with a single word. It is based on a similar structure in which filmmaker Su Friedrich built her film 'Sink or Swim' around. In this, she took words starting with the backwards alphabet, (Z)ygote, (Y)Chromosome, (X)Chromosome, (W)itness, etc. This lead the film into a relationship with her father that after viewing was completely real and understandable, but indescribable. 'The Lonely Lights...' is the study of a character that has no discernible arch or event in which changes him dramatically, but rather a series of experiences that has created a person from nothing. The form of cinema is false, but this character is real. It works with the theme, 'who we are is who we were.'
