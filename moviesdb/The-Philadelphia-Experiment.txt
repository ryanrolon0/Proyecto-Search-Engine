The Philadelphia Experiment

 Reportedly based on a true incident during World War II involving an anti-radar or invisibility experiment that caused a US Navy Destroyer Eldridge to disappear from Philadelphia Harbor. A sailor finds himself thrown into the future (1984). During World War II, the government was trying to develop a way to render their naval vessels undetectable to radar. When the scientists in charge of it think they have done it, they try it out on one of the ships in the Philadelphia harbor. When they turn it on, the ship disappears. Two of the ship's sailors find themselves in 1984. While they try to find out what's going on. The scientist who developed the technology in 1943, is now involved with a project that somehow brought the two sailors to 1984. And it seems that a black hole has emerged and he thinks the sailors can help. So he tries to get them.
