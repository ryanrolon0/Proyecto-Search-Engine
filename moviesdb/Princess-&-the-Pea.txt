Princess & the Pea

 A prince is trapped in a castle full of surveillance cameras and a bizarre troop of bejeweled princesses competing for his hand as this beautiful yet sinister tale unfolds. Dreamy, languid sequences shot on 16mm film are cut with grainy video create a baroque contemporary vision of the classic fairy tale by Hans Anderson.
