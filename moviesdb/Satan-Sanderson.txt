Satan Sanderson

 The story of Reverend 'Satan' Sanderson, Hugh Stires and Jessica Holmes, a beautiful and romantic blind girl and ward of David Stires, father of Hugh. The latter is signing his will, making Jessica his sole heir, thereby disinheriting his dissolute son. Jessica protests and Reverend Sanderson protests to David on behalf of Hugh. Sanderson acknowledges that he himself was a wayward youth in college, the leader of a fast-set and looked favorably upon by Hugh, and he feels responsibility for Hugh's downfall. David Stires is obdurate and Jessca's sympathy goes out to Hugh and she blames Sanderson for Hugh's troubles. Sanderson, though, is in love with Jessica. Hugh returns home, gains his father's forgiveness, and weds Jessica, whose eyesight had been restored by a medical operation. And then David learns that Hugh has forged his name to a check. Davis threatens his son with jail and Hugh runs away and seeks Sanderson's help, again. From there the story takes a few turns.
