Surveillance 3

 'Surveillance 3' places us in New York City on the final night of the 2004 Republican National Convention. Amid a sea of both protestors and police awaiting the acceptance speech of President George Bush, young workers prepare for the launch of new Diesel clothing store. A young man cleans the interior surface of the store's window, sealed off from the tumultuous events occurring just outside, safe within a hermetic, commercial universe. The quiet dignity of simple labor, sensual and elegant, is juxtaposed with the edgy standoff between fiery protestors and dutifully stoic police officers.
