Reformasi Luar Angkasa

 The citizens of a small country become ecstatic upon learning that their country is building its first-ever rocket ship, and a missile to destroy a newly discovered space object that has been identified as the source of all major problems in the country. They wholeheartedly contribute their time and energy to support the space program, and cheerfully root for their new hero, the country's first ever astronaut, who will fly the country's rocket ship to deliver its one and only missile to the final target. Of course, the biggest question in everyone's mind is, will the mission succeed?
