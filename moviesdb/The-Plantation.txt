The Plantation

 In a not so distant future, society is split into two factions. The wealthy live on Mars and force everyone else to live on what is left of Earth to harvest food. Martian law rules and the people of Earth are always being watched. This is when Telford Bishop decides to take a stand. He hordes his crops until he is turned in by his friend Stan Tresden and taken to Mars to be made an example of.
