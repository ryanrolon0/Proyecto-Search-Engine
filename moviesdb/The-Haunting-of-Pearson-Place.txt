The Haunting of Pearson Place

 THE HAUNTING of PEARSON PLACE, In hopes of rebuilding their once-storybook marriage, Gwen and Steven (a young, attractive and successful couple) purchase a vacant Victorian house in a small town, intent on rebuilding the once beautiful house along with their marriage. The house at Pearson Place was once used as a hospice for returning soldiers from World War I. The now long-dead veterans were expecting kindness upon arrival at Pearson Place only to find that the war was Heaven compared to the house which is truly Hell. Our modern day couple intend to use the house as a B&B but - Pearson Place and its previous tenants have their own ideas.
