Teri Meherbaniyan

 Ram (Jackie shroff) is an honest young man, who comes to the village of the powerful and corrupt Thakur Vijay Singh (Amrish Puri). On the way his vehicle breaks down and he meets with beautiful Bijli (Poonam Dhillon), and both fall in love with each other subsequently. Thakur Vijay Singh's men, especially Munim Banwarilal (Asrani), and Sardari (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) clash with Ram, and retreat, beaten, to their boss. Ram helps Gopi (Raj Kiran), who is dumb, and Sharda Devi (Swapna), and assists them in their life, and encourage to marry. Thakur Vijay Singh has his eye on Sharda, and has Ram killed by his men, and frames Gopi for the killing. Gopi is arrested by the police and is jailed. The only one who witnesses the killing is Ram's dog, Moti. Bijli also passes away, leaving her father (Satyen Kappo) distraught and close to insanity. Who will bring now help bring justice to Gopi; and who will avenge the killing of Ram?
