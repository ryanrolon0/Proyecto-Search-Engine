Rave Against the Machine

 Rave Against the Machine tells the tragic and uplifting story of a troubled group of young musicians who strove to keep their sanity during the four year siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s. Ducking and twisting to avoid shellfire and snipers bullets, the film colorfully describes the music they made; parties they organized and the radio they broadcast.
