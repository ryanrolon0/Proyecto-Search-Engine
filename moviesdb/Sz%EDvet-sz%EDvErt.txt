Szívet szívErt

 The Lajos Zilahy story tells of an impoverished Hungarian noble family that lost its money during the war and has come upon hard times in the post-war World War I days. Eva Szorenvi, the oldest daughter, is involved in an automobile accident near the estate of the non-impoverished family of Antal Pager, and is taken to the home to recover. While recovering she manages to get all of her family jobs as domestics on the Pager estate, and is headed for the altar with Pager as the film ends.
