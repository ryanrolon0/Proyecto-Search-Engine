The Lion King 1½

 Timon and Pumbaa start to watch the original Lion King movie, but Timon keeps insisting to fast forward to when they come in, because they weren't seen in the beginning of the story or anywhere until halfway through. Pumbaa suggests telling the audience their story, which begins before Simba's journey begins. Through this, we meet Timon's mother and Uncle Max, discover why he left his meerkat colony, where he learned Hakuna Matata, how he meets Pumbaa, and the perils they encountered while searching for their dream home. Imagine a cross between _Lion King, The (1994)_ (qv) and _Back to the Future Part II (1989)_ (qv). This is a separate story thread, that of Timon and Pumbaa, intertwined with the original story. Thus, along with seeing new events (e.g. Timon's departure from the meerkat colony, Timon and Pumbaa's first meeting, the origin of "Hakuna Matata"), we get to see a new perspective on (and some previously unseen causes for) some of the events in the original film. Oh, and the whole thing is told in a _"Mystery Science Theater 3000" (1988)_ (qv) framework, with Timon and Pumbaa narrating and interacting with the "onscreen" movie.
