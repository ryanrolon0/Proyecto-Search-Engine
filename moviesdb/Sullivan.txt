Sullivan

 The day to day life of Canadian painter and choreographer Francoise Sullivan, filmed in her studio in Pointer St-Charles (near Montreal, in Quebec province) during the winter and spring of 2009. Gestures tirelessly repeated. Moments of silence. Questions asked movement, dancers, in a choreography. A few words. An encounter.
