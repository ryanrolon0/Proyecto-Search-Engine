But soon after a woman's successful husband returned from the war, he was murdered. His unsolved murder left his widow, Karen Brody, financially and emotionally struggling. Losing her husband was painful enough. But working for his sleazy ex-business partner was almost unbearable. Then an unexpected lesson, led to a life-changing revelation, and a new life.
