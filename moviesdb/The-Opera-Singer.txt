The Opera Singer

 Comic short about an opera singer's ill-fated attempt at the performance of her life. The film is in part a satire on the commercialisation of the arts, but is all about the humour. It was originally part of an interactive performance in which the audience became an unwitting part, but now works as a standalone piece.
