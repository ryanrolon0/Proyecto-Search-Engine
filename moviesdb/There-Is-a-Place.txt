There Is a Place

 The Studio BAYCAT Internship Program employs three aspiring digital media producers from the Bay Area community each term, a Cinematographer, Graphic Designer and a Video Editor. The three interns worked with their mentors and the program directors to develop and produce the short movie, There is a Place. The film takes us into the life of an 11 year old girl living in foster care in San Francisco's Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood. When her birth mother suddenly appears in her living room she is faced with having to decide to stay with her new, welcoming foster family, or leave with her possibly unstable mother. Her mom swears she's changed, but can she believe her?
