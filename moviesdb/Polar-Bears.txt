Polar Bears

 These fellows are good on the squeeze, too. They are particularly interesting in that their coat is snow white. They live in the far North amid snow and ice, and do not easily become thoroughly acclimated in this part of the country. The picture is bright and distinct, and any one seeing it will ask for a repetition. An excellent subject.
