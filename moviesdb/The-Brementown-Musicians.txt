The Brementown Musicians

 A farmer lashes out at his livestock after the animals disappoint him in a variety of ways. The animals are upset at the farmer's frustration and run away. When they see a quartet singing for change on the street, they decide to start a band of their own. When they do poorly, they dejectedly return home to see the farmer being burglarized by three criminals. They save the farmer and find themselves in his favor once again. A dog, a mule, a cat, and a rooster incur the wrath of the old farmer and he cats them out of the barnyard. They wander away dolefully, as they have no job skills beyond being a dog, a mule, a cat and a rooster, and see four street minstrels sing in front of a house and collecting a lot of money. They try to follow suit, with disastrous results as they harmonize with their natural voices (sounds.) But they see their former farmer-owner being threatened by robbers, and go to his rescue. He re-installs them at their former positions as...a dog, a mule, a cat, and a rooster.
