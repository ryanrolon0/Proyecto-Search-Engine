The Sandman

 The Sandman's main character is Dream who is essentially the anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At the start of the series, he is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Sandman escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence.
