The Road Less Travelled

 Middle aged Chrissie is bored. Stuck at home with her husband's laundry, she begins to realize that her life is not all it's cracked up to be. While cleaning her apartment, she reads a flyer that's put under the door for an intensive driving course. She can almost taste her independence. Unbeknownst to her husband, she embarks on the course taking back control of her life. The freedom fills her with a new thirst for life. On the last night of her course, she goes home to a barrage of verbal abuse from her husband. The next day she tapes an anniversary card to the refrigerator and hits the road. Her suitcases neatly packed in a shiny new car.
