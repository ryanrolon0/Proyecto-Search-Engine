The Gilded Spider

 An unusual story about the crossing paths of the poor Italian family of the sculptor Giovanni (Lon Chaney) and a reckless American millionaire, Cyrus Kirkham (Gilmore Hammond). Louise Lovely plays two parts - Giovanni's wife Leonita, who comes to grief when Cyrus falls in love with her, and Giovanni's daughter Elisa, whose beauty brings a horrific resolution to the two family's woes.
