Shards of Glass

 A rock musician with a message performs in a seedy bar with patrons that could care less about her and her music. Meanwhile, on the television, a world event reflecting the musician's message unfolds. As frustration in the bar grows, the musician loses her temper and things in her life start to fall apart, but nothing could prepare her for what occurs during the evening news.
