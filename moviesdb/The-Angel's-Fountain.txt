The Angel's Fountain

 A dark urban fairy tale that follows a brief but pivotal encounter between a bi-polar vagrant, a desperate hooker, and her deranged pimp. On the verge of collapse from malnutrition and hunger, a homeless Billy (Patrick Dean) scours for change at the bottom of a supernatural fountain holding the hopes and dreams of those who cast their wishes there. Worn thin from the seedy and violent lifestyle that comes with being a prostitute, a kind hearted and lonely hooker named Angelina (April Perry)casts her wish for love and an escape from the cold, dark world she remains bound to. As Angelina and Billy cross paths at The Angel's Fountain, each believes they are the answer to each others prayers. In a world where one's blessing is another's curse, Angelina's pimp (Damien Colletti) adds a very dangerous fuel to this already volatile cocktail of lust, greed, loss, and violence.
