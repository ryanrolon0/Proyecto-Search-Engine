Punk Rock Holocaust

 Set one year after the original Punk Rock Holocaust, the demonic Executioner's headless, undead corpse is back on the 2004 Vans Warped Tour and it's looking for its head! The killer's body is tearing the heads off of various band members and sticking them on the jagged spinal cord where his neck used to be, using them to look for his own head. The heads retain the personality of the band member but the body is pure evil and is still carrying out the killings. The heads aren't on too good and keep falling off. On the tour there is total "Holocaust Denial" as all of the tour production staff refutes the reports of carnage that happened in the previous year. One precocious, nubile "Holocaust Survivor" has become a reporter for a small independent magazine. She is determined to get to the bottom of the story and reveal the truth to the world. Kevin Lyman is hiding something, but why? And what?
