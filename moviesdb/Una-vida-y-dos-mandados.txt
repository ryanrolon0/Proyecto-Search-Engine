Una vida y dos mandados

 The story of Romer, who on his 50th birthday, returns to the Andes where he grew up after he has a premonition that his mother has died. On his journey he comes to a fork in the road, and takes a path which leads him to revisit his past--an upbringing in a remote traditional community which fiercely protects its ancient customs from modernity.
