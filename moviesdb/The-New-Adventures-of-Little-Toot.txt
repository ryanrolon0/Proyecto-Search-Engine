The New Adventures of Little Toot

 Captain Dogwood has been lost at sea, and now it's up to his two puppies, Tina and Andy. Aided by Salty the Pelican and Echo the Dolphin (and avoiding a nasty gang of cats and a living storm called Typhoon Tessie), they journey on the talking tugboat Little Toot--eventually finding their father, and rescuing him from the soon-to-erupt volcanic island, Krackaninja!
