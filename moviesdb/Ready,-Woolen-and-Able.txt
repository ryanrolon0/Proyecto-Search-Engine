Ready, Woolen and Able

 A hungry Ralph Wolf wants to swipe and eat some of the sheep in Sam Sheepdog's flock. Not only does Sam foil all of Ralph's schemes, but he turns up everywhere Ralph goes, even on a nearby beach and inside a whale's mouth! Ralph goes bonkers and has to be driven away in a straight jacket.
