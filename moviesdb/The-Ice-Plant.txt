The Ice Plant

 Emotionally challenged Ida works happily alone at an Ice cube factory until her perfect world is disrupted by the arrival of Howie, an impulsive dreamer. Shadowed by monotony Ida exists in a world she thought she controlled, but now that world is slowly freezing her. Packing ice is not Howie's dream vocation, he is clumsy and hates routines. Howie's warmth and spontaneity interfere with Ida's steady struggle to survive the cold and she must face the realization that her cold cover is dangerously close to melting point.
