The Body of Work

 A fabulous party girl-artist can't pay her rent. She needs a muse for a new show. She roams seedy streets at night in her van and seduces and then kidnaps 3 homeless, hustler boys...She shuts the party down and keeps him, but soon enough, she will face the consequences of her twisted, new body of work...
