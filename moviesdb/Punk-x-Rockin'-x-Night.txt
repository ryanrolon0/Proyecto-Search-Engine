Punk x Rockin' x Night

 The end is coming. A couple of punks are waiting for the time of the arriving of police at the sea side. They don't care about getting arrested. Woman talks about the end of the world and man just plays around. According to woman, we all live in the signal. When something has ended, that something transmits a signal of an end. But, until the signal gets received by someone or something, that something keeps living in the signal, the end of the world. Man put out a ghetto blaster, but it's out of juice. Police siren howls. The light gets brighter. Woman starts dancing. The blaster begins to receive something. Radio noise and siren gets louder and louder. When the chaos reaches at the peak, suddenly, all the noise goes off. Woman keeps dancing in a silence with a smile.
