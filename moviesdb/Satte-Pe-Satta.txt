Satte Pe Satta

 After the passing away of their parents, Ravi Anand, the eldest of seven brothers, takes it upon himself to raise them - albeit a little wild and kinda animal-like. The brothers all sport long beards, hate taking showers/baths, and above all hate Ravi bossing them around. When Ravi tries to convince Nurse Sheela to marry his friend, Shekar, he mistakenly lectures the wrong girl, Indu, and as result Ravi falls head over heels in love with her. But Indu is not available to marry any stinky creep, who has not washed himself in weeks, so Ravi shaves, washes, dresses up smart, successfully woos Indu and marries her. After the marriage, Indu is shocked when she gets to meet the rest of his terrifying brothers, all the more when Ravi did not even mention that he had more than one brother. Nevertheless, Indu decides to make a go of this marriage, instills some sense and responsibility amongst the brother and soon becomes pregnant. Then her wheel-chair bound friend, Seema Singh, and five of her girlfriends come over to stay with them, resulting in some more changes taking place, this time with the rest of the brothers - who too smarten up like Ravi and start wooing Seema's friends. Then one day Ravi is abducted by Seema's paternal uncle, Ranjit Singh and his men, and held in an underground cellar on an isolated island. The person who takes Ravi's place is his look-alike, an ex-convict, Babu. His mission to find Seema and kill her so that Ranjit can claim her inheritance, and if necessary, kill anyone else who dares to oppose him.
