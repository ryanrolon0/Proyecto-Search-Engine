The Grey Hounded Hare

 Bugs Bunny ends up at a dog race and decides to take in the show. However, the mechanical rabbit is released (for the dogs to follow), and Bugs falls head over heals in love with the "light brown hare"! Unfortunately, when Bugs sees all of the dogs chasing "that cute little bunny", he valiantly runs onto the track and starts to take down the dogs one by one! Things seem to be in the bag, unless you count a huge grey dog that isn't going to let Bugs stand in his way of winning!
