The Revenants

 Multicultural teens Joo-Eun and Michael are on a lonely search for their place in the world. When the two are introduced by Joo-Eun's nihilistic boyfriend Zach, a mutual interest is sparked. As they begin covertly growing close, it becomes clear that there is much more at stake than simple crises of identity. The relationship quickly becomes a catalyst for disturbing events, yet brings about powerful change. The Revenants is a fresh and insightful look at the struggles of people to cope with the brutality of life, and find a way to feel whole and alive. A drama set in high school, the movie deals with issues that transcend age.
