Te Whare

 A modern parable looking at the relationship between Maori, the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, and the British colonisers. Set in a modern house, Hone invites his friend to stay when things go bad. He then finds his home taken over and his rights suddenly removed. How will he deal with this?
