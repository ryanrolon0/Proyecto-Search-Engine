Rusalka

 Rusalka is a young girl mysteriously imprisoned in a tower, whose future is thrown into question when she uncovers her tragic past. A tale of self discovery and indecision, Rusalka has the feel of a well-loved bedtime story, albeit a sad one. This experimental fairytale uses stop frame animation, live action and illustration, features an emotive, original score and is written with a poetic flourish.
