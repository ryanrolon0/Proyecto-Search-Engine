The Robber Bride

 The facts with three pints of her blood splattered inside, and one of her fingers severed from her body is found close to the car. From these facts, the authorities believe there is no way she could have survived what looks to be a brutal slaying. Henry Kelly, her police officer secret boyfriend, believes he will be implicated as the murderer. Henry goes to his old friend John Grismer, an ex-police officer now insurance investigator, to help him uncover what happened to Zenia. In his search for the truth, John finds that Zenia's three supposedly closest friends - magazine editor Roz Andrews, university history professor Tony Fremont and yoga instructor Charis White - are all less than sad at Zenia's death, their lack of remorse which they are open about when questioned by John. Apparently, Zenia came unexpectedly and independently into each of their lives, made it great for a while before she did something intentionally to ruin their friendship. As John uncovers some of the information regarding Zenia's relationship with these three women, he finds that the bonds of friendship go deep. Journalist and seductress Zenia Arden has disappeared. When her finger turns up on the shores of Lake Ontario -- next to her blood-soaked car -- the police believe they've uncovered a homicide. The prime suspect is Zenia's lover, a young cop named Henry but John Grismer, cynical ex-cop turned insurance investigator, believes his friend is innocent. In an effort to prove it, John begins to question Zenia's three closest friends Tony, Charis and Roz. Their stories about the mysterious Zenia quickly reveal that nothing about this woman is as it seems, and that all three women have good reasons to want her dead and gone forever.
