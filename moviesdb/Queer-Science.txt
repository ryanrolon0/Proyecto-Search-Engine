Queer Science

 A look at several of the studies under way at the UCLA Center for Gender Based Biology. One studies looks at the DNA differences between identical twins where one of the pair is straight while the other is gay. Another study involves the MRI analysis & comparison of the brains of trans-gendered men with the brains of straight identified men and women. While the scientists involved state that their scientific curiosity is legitimate, others question whether they are influenced by societal stereotypes and question whether eugenics be an influence.
