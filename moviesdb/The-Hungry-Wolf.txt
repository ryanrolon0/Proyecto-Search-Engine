The Hungry Wolf

 Winter. A wolf is out of food, and begins hallucinating, seeing a rope as sausages and a rolling pin as an ear of corn. A young rabbit, lost in the snow, comes in, and the wolf eyes him hungrily. The rabbit is amazingly polite, and just before the wolf is about to cook him, asks the wolf to be his daddy. The wolf can't eat him, and sends him away. But the hunger will not stop, so he sets out in search of the rabbit.
