The Nutcracker Family

 Across the country every fall, ballet companies big and small rehearse many versions of the annual favorite, 'The Nutcracker.' This film is about the children who enter the stage door to rehearse and perform today, and about those who performed during the last fifty years in George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, as presented by the New York City Ballet at the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center.
