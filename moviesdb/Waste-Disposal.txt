Waste Disposal

 In a gory homage to the 80's teen-slasher flicks, Waste Disposal is a scary urban legend. Emma (Julie Grant - Solitude) is getting ready for a wild night out with the girls, but the far from normal friendly-neighbourhood serial-killer Mr X (Rob Talbot - Season of the Witch; Dementia) is about to change all that. Taking advantage of an opportunist moment, he attacks Emma and uses his new waste disposal unit to dispose of the evidence in a way that is sure to void the Warranty. WASTE DISPOSAL is a dark, disturbing little shocker with a brutal twist in the tale that will have you sleeping with the lights on - and never be able to have a bath by yourself again.
