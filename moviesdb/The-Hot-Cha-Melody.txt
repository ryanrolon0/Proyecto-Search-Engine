The Hot Cha Melody

 Krazy's a Tin Pan Alley songwriter with writer's block. The devil has a solution 'Robert Schumann' (qv). Krazy resists for a while, but the tune is irresistibly catchy, and soon becomes a hit. This drives a statue/spirit of Schumann crazy, and he's soon seeking out Krazy to get his revenge.
