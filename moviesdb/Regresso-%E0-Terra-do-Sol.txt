Regresso à Terra do Sol

 A realistic view of street scenes of Luanda, with no racial segregation, and just a hint of the colonial war by the presence of some soldiers in the esplanades. Some historic monuments, the grandeur of nature, the calm bay on the coast to the magnificent waterfalls in the interior are a silent appeal to peace and tourism. The contrast of a past grandeur and some buildings in decay is made more sharp with the lavish skyscraper facade and busy interior of a modern bank headquarters.
