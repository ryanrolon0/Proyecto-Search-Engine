Sekundenfalle

 Sekundenfalle can, with simplification, be reduced to a film on the theme inside/outside. The treatment is located especially on the cuts such as the window in the wall, the TV as a window into an imaginary room, the surface of the skin with a wound as an entry point as well as the "actor" who represents a thermal frontier. Even so, the images in Sekundenfalle do not serve to illustrate a theme. Much more important is that Brehm shows what he shows. (Peter Tscherkassky)
