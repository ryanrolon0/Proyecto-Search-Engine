Solito

 The major impact of pornography on our society is portrayed in a comical manner through the story of Enrique Choval, a young Spaniard who suffers from an addiction to pornography which gets in his way in forming relationship with women. The storyline casts a critical eye for the responsibility of society, and mainly of the porn industry, for Enrique predicament. With the help of Imagine Wilcox, an experienced feminist lawyer, Enrique leads a collective lawsuit against the porn industry for its share of responsibility for the state of his mind - and that of many others - which has become perverted.
