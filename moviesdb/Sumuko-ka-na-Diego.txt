Sumuko ka na Diego

 Sumuko Ka Na Diego (Surrender Now Diego) is an homage to the dying Filipino children's game called 'teks' told as a coming of age story set in the slums of Metro Manila. Twelve-year-old Nel is obsessed with playing teks as he helps his parents augment their meager income by selling cigarettes. Surrounded by vice, gambling and random violence, Nel finds comfort playing this seemingly innocent game with his friends. He also escapes reality and immerses himself into the action-filled world created by the fictional film (Sumuko Ka Na, Diego) depicted in the teks cards. Nel's world comes to a head when violence hits home and his favorite game becomes passe.
