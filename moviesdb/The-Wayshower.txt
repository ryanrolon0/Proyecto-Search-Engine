The Wayshower

 Running from mistakes of the past, a man finds a secret book with ancient powers - a tool that can give him the answers he seeks. But a Dark Force has been awoken... one that will stop at nothing to reclaim the sacred text. When the book is stolen, an age long batte resumes. But his teacher a "Wayshower", can only show him the path to victory, for only he can win this epic battle on his own. Running from his mistakes, Jesus heads to Helper, Utah to reconnect with his mentor/teacher's past. Through dreams and a Mystical book, he learns from his mentor's past-life mistakes. He realizes he must confront his own inner conflict, forgiving the past and self examining himself, he finds peace and reunites with his Mentor/teacher.
