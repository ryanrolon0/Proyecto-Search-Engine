The Learning Lab

 What kind of leadership does the future need? Can it be taught and if so, how? In 2010, a group of 20 students enrolled in a course by the University of Amsterdam, with the vague description 'Pioneering in Leadership Learning'. The outcome was a group of young pioneers who are now, according to the president of the university 'defining the modern educational landscape'. This documentary shows their adventures as they progress from talented students to inspired entrepreneurs and ultimately, directors of their own education. Through their development, the film tries to give an answer to the question, how can an educational system provide the opportunity for tomorrow's leaders to emerge?
