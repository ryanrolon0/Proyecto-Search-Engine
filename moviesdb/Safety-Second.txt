Safety Second

 It's Independence Day, and Jerry's little nephew, Nibbles, wants to celebrate with fireworks, while Jerry reminds him to "keep it safe and sane." Initially, this backfires against Jerry, as his attempts to dispose of the firecrackers Nibbles lights explode in his face, but ultimately, Nibbles saves Jerry from Tom with the usual cartoon uses of black powder.
