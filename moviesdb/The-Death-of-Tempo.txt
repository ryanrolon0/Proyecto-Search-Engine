The Death of Tempo

 Mike Freeman (David Haverty) was a happy, carefree musician with a part time job at a local taco stand until things took a turn for the worse! Losing his job forces him into a life of permanent-temporary employment. He becomes a shell of a man who relies on self medicated prescription pills and other vices. Soon he finds himself in a mind numbing; never ending routine which he cannot escape and becomes trapped in his own world of despair, fighting a constant daily battle between himself and his life's surroundings.
