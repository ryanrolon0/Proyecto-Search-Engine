Sunday in New York

 Eileen is 22 and is smarting from her breakup with Russ. She comes to New York to visit her brother, Adam, who is an airline pilot. Eileen confides to her brother that she thinks she may be the only 22 year old virgin left in the world. Adam assures her that sex is not what all men look for and insists he hasn't slept around. Of course, Adam is lying and is in hot pursuit of a tryst with his occasional girlfriend Mona. However, Adam's date with Mona has a series of job related interruptions. Meanwhile, Eileen decides to see if she can have some fun for herself in New York, and seems to find the perfect candidate in Mike, a man she meets on the bus. But things get complicated when Russ pops in with a proposal and a mistaken assumption. Eileen is 22 and engaged to Russ. She comes to New York to visit her brother, Adam, who is an airline pilot. One of Eileen's concerns is that she may be the only 22 year old virgin left in the world. Russ assures her that sex is not want all men look for and that he does not, in fact, concern himself about different women every time. Of course, Adam is lying and is hot on a date with his occasional girlfriend Mona. However, Adam's date with Mona has a series of job related interruptions. Eileen is unsure about marrying Russ, and decides to see if she can have some fun for herself in New York. But can she have that kind of fun with Mike who she meets on the bus?
