Rihaee

 The men in this town are away to work, leaving the women to fend for themselves and their respective children, until they return. While the men patronize various courtesans and prostitutes while away from their wives, their wives have also figured out a way of satisfying their sexual pleasure. And then one day, one of the wives, Shaku, declares that she is pregnant, and that the child is not that of her husband, Amarji. There is furore all over the small town, and there are demands that Shaku be expelled, and the matter is left to the town panchayat to decide her fate. It is then the women, who have been silent, speak up. But will their voices be heard and taken note of?
