Room Zero

 Wayne Adam Ford is a convicted serial killer on Death Row. Victoria Redstall is a model who trained to be a cop. Together, and against all odds, Ford and Redstall take us on a roadtrip into the mind of a serial killer and attempt to find the identity of his first victim. All that remained of her was a dismembered torso.
