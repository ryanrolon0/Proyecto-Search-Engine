The Actress and the Cowboys

 Mr. and Mrs. Richards, traveling in stock, in the West, are stranded in Bowie, Texas. Over a thousand miles from home, they have but a few dollars between themselves and starvation. After a conference at the depot, they decide to sell the stage jewelry of Mrs. Richards, and Mr. Richards, going up the street, attempts to sell the "bangles," etc., to the cowboys; they laugh and shout in derision, and cause him to dance to the music of their guns. It is up to the "actor people" to find a job, and Mr. Richards goes to work upon a truck farm and learns to feed the pigs. Mrs. Richards is more fortunate, and obtains a job feeding cowboys. As a waitress she is an immediate hit, and the cowboys all fall in love with her. Desiring to give her a token of their regard, they hunt up the actor in the pig pen vicinity, and purchase his stock of jewelry. They return to the fair charmer in the restaurant, presenting their gifts, and they are also made happy when she requests them to meet her at the depot in an hour. Hurrying to the depot, she finds her husband and shows him the jewelry given her by her cowboy admirers. Mr. Richards becomes angry, thinking she has been indiscreet, and she experiences some difficulty in convincing him otherwise. The cowboys arrive in time to be introduced to the husband of the fair charmer, where the happy couple return to that "dear Broadway," and it is a crestfallen bunch of "punchers" they leave behind them.
