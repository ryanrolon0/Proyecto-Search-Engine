She Wrote the Book

 A plain-Jane math professor (Joan Davis) at a small midwestern college is talked into journeying to New York on behalf of a colleague who has written a steamy bestseller under an assumed name. While in the big city, the math prof receives a bump on the head which brings on a form of amnesia. She begins to believe she is the author of the sultry book, and has actually lived its story. Now freed from her inhibitions, the lady professor sashays about with abandon. With a PR man (Jack Oakie) in tow, she crashes a party of swells at the home of a wealthy industrialist (Thurston Hall) and pressures him into making a large contribution to her tiny college back home.
