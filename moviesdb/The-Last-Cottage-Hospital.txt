The Last Cottage Hospital

 The Last Cottage Hospital leads a young couple on a frightening journey to diagnose a mysterious medical condition in Newfoundland's last operational cottage hospital.

Now the resident ghost is on the case! A trip to an anachronistic emergency room that will make you open your mouth and scream AH!
