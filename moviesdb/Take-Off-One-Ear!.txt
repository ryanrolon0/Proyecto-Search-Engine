Take Off One Ear!

 An experimental music documentary based on SARMATICA's recording sessions in Kiev, Ukraine, in early 2010, and a meditation on the process of representation in general and music recording in particular. The music featured is a crossover project between early music (from the Lviv Lute Tablature) and Ukrainian folk styles. Thoughtful and poetic, it offers great music and engaging cinematography.
