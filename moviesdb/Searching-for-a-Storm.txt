Searching for a Storm

 Searching for a Storm debates the question of whether the United Nations was correct in treating the war in the former Yugoslavia as a civil conflict rather than a war of aggression by Serb president Slobodan Milosevic. The film examines the UN war crimes case of Croatian general, Ante Gotovina and asks if he has been made a political scapegoat by the court in order to justify UN policies during the war.
