Simply Human

 Simply Human tells the story of Mrs. Hans Snoek, a 90-year old Dutch dancer. Famous in the Netherlands for being the creator of the Scapino Ballet, the Krakeling Theater and many more artistic and humanistic activities, including the creation of the Toverbal, a foundation dedicated to help refugee children overcome trauma through the arts. There's one facet of Snoek's life, however, that was little known. During World War II she hid Jews in her Amsterdam home.
