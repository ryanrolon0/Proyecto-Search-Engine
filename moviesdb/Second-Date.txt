Second Date

 Diane had a one-night stand with Jason. She realizes she forgot her glasses and a week later she drives back to Jason. He's poking some worms with a stick. Diane only wants her glasses back, but the surprised Jason tries to invite her for a coffee. Diane gives in and they get a coffee from a shop down the street. When they come back, the worms are dead. Discussing the sexual relations of the female worm, they soon start talking about their own relationship.
