Silence! On voudrait bien s'aimer...

 A cyclist restlessly talking to his cellphone; a young pest of a child and her old-fashioned nanny; a cartoon-like policeman sticking to the rules and rather strange public gardener; a Fellinian ogress; some Japanese tourists; a bunch of puzzling characters "a la Jacques Prevert" who happen to disturb Jeannot - a young and dreamy student - and his ecologist dog during their daily walk, thus thwarting his plans for meeting with the beautiful young Julie. Or is this world pure imagination ? After all, can dreamers make their dreams come true ?
