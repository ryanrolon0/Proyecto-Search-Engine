The Serpent and the Eagle

 The story of how Spanish conqueror Cortez, one of Mexican history's most controversial figures, flattened the Aztec nation and plundered its riches with the help of an Aztec princess-turned-slave. Cortez is, in some quarters, considered to be a traitor. Malinali, a slave woman given by an Aztec tribe as a peace offering to the Cortez, became highly valuable to the conquerer when he realized she spoke Spanish as well as the Aztec languages. She became his translator, lover and adviser.
