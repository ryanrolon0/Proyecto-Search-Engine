Small Medium at Large

 At four feet tall, Anne Morse is a medium with extraordinary powers that reach beyond the grave. By using an ancient Chinese meditation ritual known as Chi Gong, Morse speaks with spirit guides by moving and receiving energy like a transmitter. In Small Medium at Large, Morse seeks out the answers to questions the dead have left behind. From celebrities to politicians- famous and infamous - each week Anne will travel to grave sites, homes and favorite haunts of famous people who have died inviting the dearly departed to tell their stories and secrets - to go on the record using their own words one last time. Along the way personal stories and unexpected twists and turns will introduce us to family members, friends and strangers who may have never realized their personal connections with the dead.
