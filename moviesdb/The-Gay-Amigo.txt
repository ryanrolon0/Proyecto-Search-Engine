The Gay Amigo

 Chasing Mexican bandits, the Captain sees Cisco and Pancho ride away. Assuming they are the bandits he captures them and then lets them go. He has them followed figuring they will lead him to the entire gang. Cisco learns the editor and the blacksmith are the leaders. He makes the blacksmith think his partner double-crossed him and then joins up with him as his new partner planning to lead the entire gang into a trap. Bandits are raising havoc on the Mexico/Arizona border and The Cisco Kid ('Duncan Renaldo' (qv)) and his pal Pancho ('Leo Carrillo' (qv)) are tagged by the U.S. Cavalry as leaders of the gang because they had been seen with one of the bandits who has fallen from his horse just across the border where the American troops can not follow. Cisco discovers the dead bandit is not Mexican but disguised as such. He and Pancho cross into Arizona to clear up this masquerade and to find the real culprits. This involves Sergeant McNulty to has been ordered to capture the pair. Cisco, always able to mix a little romance in his adventures, finds the barmaid, Rosita ('Armida' (qv)), very handy for that and also using her to get his first lead on the outlaws and their leader. The Cisco Kid and Pancho are mistakenly identified as leaders of an outlaw band. While the cavalry runs them down, they must hunt down the real bad guys.
