The End of the Road

 It's a wet summer day on upstate New York's Route 90. A serial killer is loose from the local penitentiary. A hymn-singing grandma picks up a shadow-boxing hitchhiker (she's Helen, he's John Thomas). She offers him a ride to the end of the road, where Route 90 hits the Interstate. He jumps in. They chat "needs to, you know, get away." She turns on the radio, and he observes that music calms the savage beast. He's carrying a large knife and asks her to pull over so he can answer nature's call. He's back quickly, inviting her to see a beautiful sylvan scene just off the road out of sight. Will she follow? What lies in store?
