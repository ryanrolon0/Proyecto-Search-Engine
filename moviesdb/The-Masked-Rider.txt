The Masked Rider

 Every previous shipment of silver bullion from the "Mina de Plata de la Compania Valdez" has been held up by a mysterious bandit known as the Masked Rider, despite the best efforts of mine owner Don Sebastian Valdez and his foreman Douglas. Jean Malone, whose late father was the Don's partner, and Margarita Valdez, the Don's daughter, ask Larry Prescott and his sidekick, Patches McQuilt, for their help in putting an end to the raids of the Masked Rider and his gang. An outlaw known as the White Mask is robbing the silver shipments from Don Sebastian's mine and Larry Prescott has been called in. Larry soon suspects the Don's foreman Douglas who stands to gain if the shipments don't get through. So he sends out a fake pack train planning to get the White Mask when he attacks. But Douglas learns of the hoax, puts on his white mask and he and his men go after the real silver shipment.
