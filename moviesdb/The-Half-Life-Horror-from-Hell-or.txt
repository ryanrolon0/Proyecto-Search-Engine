The Half-Life Horror from Hell or

 A mysterious glowing monster is savagely attacking citizens of a small town on the eve of a huge televised metal concert. But what connection does this creature have to the old nuclear plant? And the band, Irradiated Satan? And the local crime boss? And... the Mayor? HOW HIGH DOES THIS THING GO???? A low-level crook and his hot, recreational drug enthusiast hippie chick friend aim to find out! With the help of the drunken town Sheriff and an eccentric Native American Shaman, they'll encounter Satanic priests, Voodoo hoodoo, scheming incestuous step-siblings, and a radioactive menace as they seek to uncover the truth, and save the very fabric of society as we know it in the process!
