Sex! With Hot Robots

 SEX! With Hot Robots is a 10 minute comedy that takes place 30 years in the future, a time when hot robot 'maids' have permeated suburban North American homes. The film documents the rise of these 'hot-bots', from their vacuum cleaner origins, to the impact made by their top selling models such as the Lisa 400 and Roger 350.
