 Perpetual-optimist "Dreamy" Smith aspires to quit his job as newspaper publicity drudge and sail the world. But life--and his editor--conspires against him. Not only does the car he intends using as the boat's downpayment roll into the bay, but his boss starts to claim "Dreamy's" better publicity ideas as his own.
