Strips Around the World

 A performer goes to a travel agency with hopes of visiting foreign countries. After seeing the performer's juggling act, the travel agent agrees to letting him work his way over to Pamonia, a mythical oriental country where the agent's brother is a Pasha. The performer exchanges words with the Pasha in a comedy routine; watches the Pasha's dancing girls perform and do a series of suggestive dances; performs his juggling act while riding a miniature bike; watches the harem dance and strip; does a comedy-eating routine; watches some more dancing and stripping...and becomes the new ruler of Pamonia.
