Smile, Buttercup, Smile

 This film was one in a series of Shorts made by FBO in 1927-28 based on the "Toots and Casper" comic strip created and drawn by cartoonist Jimmy Murphy. The strip ran for over 40 years, and is not far removed from the "Blondie" strip created by Chic Young many years after Murphy's King Features strip first saw print. Toots was a "dish" with brains, and Casper was a pint-sized drone of a husband with ideas that usually required him to be bailed out by Toots. They had an infant boy named "Buttercup", who was the centerpiece of attention in a great many of the Sunday strips, but wasn't that involved in the dailies. The characters were played by Thelma Hill and Bud Duncan in this series of films.
