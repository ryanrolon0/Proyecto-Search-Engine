The Peel River Indians with Their Dog Teams and Toboggan Sleighs on the Trail

 The Peel River Indians are going to Dawson to see civilization for the first time. They have traveled 1,000 miles over the ice and snow. They have six toboggan sleighs which are loaded with moose and caribou meat. Scene shows them coming down the trail in the winter with the thermometer sixty degrees below zero. This picture was taken at a great risk as these Indians are uncivilized, not having before been in contact with civilization.
