The Heavenly Twins at Lunch

 Two little baby boys, who look so much alike that they have to be marked to tell them apart, are seated in high chairs enjoying their morning meal of mush and milk. Their expressions, while racing to see who will finish first, are very amusing. After the meal they are both given corncob pipes and start smoking, but blow the smoke through the pipe. Very interesting and sure to amuse.
