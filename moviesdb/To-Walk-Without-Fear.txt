To Walk Without Fear

 "To Walk Without Fear" is an uplifting story about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. At the heart of this film is the transformation of deep tragedy into an opportunity for love and understanding to flourish between people, and the hope that this love offers a world in the face of mounting crisis. It is a film which reveals the effects of landmines on people, especially children, who reside in crisis and post-crisis areas of the world. It profiles triple amputee Kenan Malkic, who at twelve, stepped on a landmine and became the most injured civilian to survive the Bosnian war. Kenan now lives and works with Elissa Montanti, the woman who single-handedly brought him to the United States for prosthetics and founded Global Medical Relief Fund, an NGO in his honor. Together, Kenan and Elissa have provided hope, dignity, and empowerment to children the world over.. More information about the Global Medical Relief Fund can be found at www.globmed.org .
