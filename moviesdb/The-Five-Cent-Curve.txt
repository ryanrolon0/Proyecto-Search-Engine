The Five-Cent Curve

 In the Five-Cent Curve, three different perspectives, a troubled mother, a young boy, and a pregnant teenager, overlap and occur at the same period in time. Seemingly random and trivial events crisscross, allowing us to watch each person's experiences unfold through their own eyes. As each character fails to clear his conscience and is left sodden with guilt, the narratives fold together and reveal a surprise outcome that no one person could have ever seen.
