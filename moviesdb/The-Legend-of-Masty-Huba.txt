The Legend of Masty Huba

 Enter the world of Masty Huba, a hobo legend. Amongst the decaying landscape of Binghamton, NY the stories of Masty remain. A fixture on the streets and in the barrooms of this small upstate city, he was kept alive - with plenty to drink - in exchange for his outrageous stories, songs, and his cheerful company. An unlikely hero, and yet over forty years later his image still dots the walls of every old bar in the city. And ask anyone sitting there long enough, and someone will have a story to tell of old Masty Huba. Depicted in photographs and paintings, these beer-stained artifacts capture the only history of one of the most famous men to ever walk the streets of Binghamton.
