The Worried German

 A Dutch workman is in the habit of eating his dinner on a barrel in a back yard adjacent to a new house. Two mischievous boys appear on the scene. One of them, arming himself with a hose, goes under the barrel. The Dutchman comes along, places his basket on the barrel and begins eating his lunch, when the nozzle of the hose is stuck through a hole in the head of the barrel and the Dutchman is soaked. The boy under the barrel is captured and severely spanked. After rearranging his dinner on the barrel, the Dutchman walks away for a pint of beer, and the two boys again appear, and quickly turning the barrel upside down, they place the cloth over it and arrange the Dutchman's lunch around the edge of the barrel. The Dutchman returning, takes a glass of beer from the pail and places the pail on the barrel, and it quickly disappears. In his excitement in reaching for it, he falls into the barrel and gets badly tangled up. Very laughable.
