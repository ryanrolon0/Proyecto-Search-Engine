Walking to Maryland

 Walking to Maryland is the latest addition to Ascension Entertainment's collection of motion pictures. Join us as we follow two people through life, a life where anything is possible and at any given second, it all can change for the better or the worse. Sometimes we have to lose it all before we can really have anything. This is a story of the love two people can share, yet illustrates how we as humans find a way to destroy everything that is beautiful. Everyone has dreams, and we have no idea which path our lives may lead us on. Riley Anderson and Matthew Fox make a decision to not let their circumstances hold them back, but allow their ambition to reinvent their lives; To allow their dreams, rather then fear and convenience, shape their future.
