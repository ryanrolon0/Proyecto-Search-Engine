Untitled Richard Brautigan Project

 For Richard Brautigan is a look at the life and literary output of one of the century's most unique and influential writers. Richard Brautigan rose to international fame in 1967 with the publication of his novel, Trout Fishing in America, which linked him, for better or worse, to the Beats and emerging counterculture. Largely dismissed or ignored by American critics, his work has since been translated into over twenty languages and continues to demand reprinting around the world. At the time of his suicide in 1984, he had produced eleven novels, ten collections of poetry, a collection of short stories and several works of non-fiction. Defined by its' accessibility, immediacy and magic, Richard's writing offered, in nearly every way, what he could not. For Richard Brautigan brings together family, friends and readers spanning 75 years and over a dozen countries to bridge the writer with his work and to remember the life that made it possible.
