To Ride a Tiger

 Billed as a documentary, but is a story presented as documentary. However it appears a true story of Monique's philosophy and technique. Monique appears quite old in this film. Story line explore her interest in pain, and in humiliating men. She visits the dungeon of famed Dutch dominatrix Monique Von Cleef. She shows her art to Monique, which reveals her fantasies. In several conversations Monique reveals her philosophy. This alternates with The Girl undergoing several sessions of domination, bondage and mild torture, and in trying the same on a man. It very matter-of-fact and boring. The Girl leaves having satisified her urge "to ride a tiger".
