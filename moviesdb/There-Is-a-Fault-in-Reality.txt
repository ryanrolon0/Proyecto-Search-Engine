There Is a Fault in Reality

 Mention Schizophrenia and what comes to mind? Benign oddballs, locked wards, or maybe axe-wielding psychos and mind-numbing medication? The word conjures up more cliches and myths than just about any other. Why then, in the light of recent breakthroughs like the much-heralded 'schizophrenic gene', do we still know so little about something that affects one percent of us in the UK? This film explores the stories of three people whose experiences help answer this question. Through them, we enter an insider's view of schizophrenia. As their stories unfold, what begins to emerge is the true identity of the voices they hear and the horrific experiences from where they first appeared. A moving, inspiring, and often shocking story, which challenges myths and orthodox holy cows alike.
