They Are Cuban

 Most Americans know nothing about what it means to be Cuban. We are not allowed to legally visit this island that is only 90 miles away. This video was conceived and produced as a companion to the photography book 'The Cubans', offering the experience of both still and moving pictures to communicate what Cuba is all about. 'They Are Cuban' is movie that offers a chance to meet many every day Cubans and get a glimpse into what their lives are like. From art to boxing, each meeting is brief while offering insight into this rich and varied culture. You will be surprised at how familiar, warm and welcoming Cubans are.
