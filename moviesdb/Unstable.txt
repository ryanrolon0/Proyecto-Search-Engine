Unstable

 A working woman recovering from an abusive relationship and its self-destructive repercussions meets a seemingly charming, friendly bank teller, whom she marries. Almost as soon as the marriage begins, she begins losing things and events begin occurring that she cannot remember, which all seem to be the fault of her husband. Whether she is actually insane from going off her medication or if her husband is inexplicably toying with her remains to be seen.
