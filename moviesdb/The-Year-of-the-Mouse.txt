The Year of the Mouse

 Jerry, with the help of a mouse friend, is lowered on a fishing line, abuses the sleeping Tom in various ways, and is yanked away before Tom sees him. First, he hits Tom with a fireplace shovel and plants it in Tom's hand; next, he puts a gun in Tom's hand and pulls the trigger; he puts a noose around Tom's neck; positions a ketchup-covered knife (complete with ketchup "wound"); and finally puts Tom into an archery bow. Tom finally gets his revenge, though.
