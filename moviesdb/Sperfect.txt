Sperfect

 There is nothing more important in life than love. When Gerry loses Monica to their handy plumber, it does more than break his heart, it drives him right over the edge. Now, with nothing left to lose, he will do anything to get her back, including kidnapping, robbery, and other federal offenses. Sperfect has a great emotional connection to the audience, since all of us have been through a rough break up in our lives. Sperfect is a film that not only proves love is blind, but also deaf, crippled, and mentally unstable. Sometimes when you follow your heart, you end up in front of an oncoming train.
