 Ash Singer is an ex-gang leader who arrives back in the city he once called home - Orlando. Looking to start his life over and repent for his past sins he finds many obstacles in his path, one of them being an old friend who is looking to control the streets herself... Waed Collins. And as Waed gets closer to reaching her goals it seems as though Ash will have to put his plans for a peaceful life on hold in order to save the life of the woman he loves, from the woman who wants them both dead.
