V.O.S.

 A game between four characters. A comedy about love and friendship. A film about the great lie of story telling that moves between reality and fiction. "Successful couples are a question of luck. It's something that's totally beyond our control. Only by happy accident can two people who love each other manage to fit perfectly so as to enjoy the rest of their lives together." Woody Allen
