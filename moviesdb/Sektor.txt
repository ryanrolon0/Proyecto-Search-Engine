 A young married couple inspects a deserted house, supposedly on sale. Inside the walls of decaying mansion resides a dark secret revealed to them by a mysterious old man. Why is it that, with the best of intentions, we do horrible things to those we love the most? Does evil haunt the souls of lovers or does possessiveness poison their blood and paralyze the mind? A fateful decision leads to sacrifice.
