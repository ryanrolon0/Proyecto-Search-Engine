The Time of the End

 Paul the taxi driver's day gets worse when he picks up a woman who claims to be The Messiah, The Second Coming. At first dismissive, he soon finds himself engaged with her stories of growing up in London, and the moment she realised who she was, and he begins to relate his own youthful tale. When they arrive at the destination the woman leaves Paul with a dilemma, perhaps a matter of life and death.
