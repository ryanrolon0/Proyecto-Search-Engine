The Flamingo Lamp

 When an antiques collector learns that a beautiful blonde possesses a valuable lamp he dispatches an beautiful crook to steal it. She captures a saleswoman and, leaving her bound and silenced, poses as a cosmetics expert to gain entry to Nicollette's house. Unfortuately a burly thug who is also intent on stealing the lamp breaks in and leaves the two ladies writhing in tight ropes and gags. In the second story, two prisoners break out of jail and decide to kidnap their former girlfriend and hightail it to friendlier climes. Connie doesn't want any part of either of her former beaus, but is kidnapped, bound and gagged by the rival crooks
