The Final Solution

 Since ancient times humanity attempted to comprehend the laws of beauty by means of art. In recent history such inquiries were almost completely suppressed by the self appointed art critics and Art Selectioners, who unwillingly created the necessity of an objective evaluation of art. In 1998 this ancient quest was finally fulfilled through the creation of the Apparatus for Measuring Beauty and Determining Healing or Harmful Energies of Works of Art. This historic breakthrough led to the Final Solution of the question on the nature of art - what is art and what art should be.
