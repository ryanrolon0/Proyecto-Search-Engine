Voices from the High School

 "Voices from the High School" takes a candid look at teenage life and the everyday struggles of high school students, capturing a frank and honest view into the frailty of our youth - from the innocence of a first kiss and petty gossip to the controversial issues of sexual exploration and the hard reality of teen suicide and abuse. Based on the Play by Peter Dee.
