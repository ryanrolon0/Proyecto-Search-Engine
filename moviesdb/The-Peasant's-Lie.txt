The Peasant's Lie

 Bribed by a jealous rival, the guardian of a young girl tells a lie which separates her from her humble lover and gives the rival an opportunity to press his suit for her hand. But the move brings into the girl's life another man, whom the schemer has cause to fear even more than her former suitor, for he, too, has wealth and manly graces. Each believes himself favored, but fate brings the truth to light, and the girl is placed out of their reach forever.
