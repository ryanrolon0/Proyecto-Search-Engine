The Footloose Heiress

 A spoiled rich girl tries to elope with a ne'er-do-well, but they are stopped by a charming hobo, who thwarts the mismatch. The girl's father, an embattled ad executive, rewards the hobo with temporary room and board. It turns out the stranger is no hobo after all, but an educated young man who then comes to his host's rescue by composing a hit advertising slogan. The girl resents the stranger at first, but eventually she realizes she has fallen in love with him.
