Surprise Vacations

 There are people in every community who unconditionally give their time to causes that are close to their hearts. And because they're so incredibly devoted and focused on the task at hand, the last thing they expect is recognition. FLN surprises these amazing volunteers with their own special trip to Walt Disney World. You'll meet those who've been selected for recognition at Walt Disney World's "Volunteer Day" and experience the excitement from the time they find out about this trip-of-a-lifetime through their arrival at the parks, accompanied by the family and friends who nominated them. Watch as Walt Disney World roll out the red carpet for these individuals who deserve to be recognized in FLN's one-hour special Surprise Vacations
