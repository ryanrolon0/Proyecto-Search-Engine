Stand-Up Morales

 On the eve of his 40th birthday, as he copes with an ugly divorce and a slew of addictions, Carl Morales, an ordinary restaurant working guy, decides at last to give his lifelong dream of becoming a stand-up comic a shot. As he mines the ironies of his past for material, he rediscovers the people in his life who've shaped the man he's become and exposes the old wounds lying just beneath the laughs.
