The Eagleman Stag

 Voiced by the cult British actor David Cann, The Eagleman Stag is a dark, cerebral comedy about a man's obsession with his quickening perception of time and the extreme lengths he goes to in order to counter the effect. Each unfolding scene is a key moment in the life of Peter, another piece in the puzzle. Realised in monochrome stopmotion, the haunting and surreal settings create a sense of contemporary film noir.
