Rodeo

 Nancy Cartwright is determined to collect an $1,800 feed bill owed to her father Harry Cartwright by a rodeo association. Instead, she is talked into assuming management of the rodeo by Slim Martin and the other performers when they learn the promoter has run off with the cash receipts. Slim and Nancy fall in love and the rodeo is beginning to prosper under her guidance. A thoughtless remark by her to Barbecue Jones, a one-time champion, now an old man, forces him to prove his fitness as a rider, with the result of being badly injured. All of the performers, including Slim, refuse to be associated with Nancy and the rodeo breaks up. Barbecue recovers and tells the hands that Nancy paid for his hospital bills with monies accumulated for her father's feed bill. The crew is rounded up and Nancy is once again prevailed upon to return as manager. She succeeds in placing the rodeo into the big time circuit, proving mostly that the writers of this had not an inkling of how rodeos actually work... then or now.
