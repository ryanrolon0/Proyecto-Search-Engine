The Last Mooseskin Boat

 A documentary about the making of the last mooseskin boat, honouring the history of the Dene people of the Mackenzie River area in the Northwest Territories of Canada. These boats, made of dried moose hides stretched over a wooden frame, were used for generations to transport people & trade goods from the mountainous regions, down to trading centres such as Fort Norman. The boat is now an exhibit at the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife.
