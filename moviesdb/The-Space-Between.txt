The Space Between

 Lisa (Vivien Reid) spends her days numb, isolated, alone in a comfort-less flat, her only respite being work at an observatory bringing her close to the stars. In London Steven (Tim Barrow) loses everything and heads for sanctuary to the city he grew up in. At dead of night, at their darkest hour, Lisa and Steven find one another, discovering kindred spirits and a chance to turn their lives around.
