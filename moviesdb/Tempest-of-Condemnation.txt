Tempest of Condemnation

 The American expatriate wife of a French banker, Madame Pierre Gautreau (Amelie) was the toast of Belle Epoque Paris for her beauty and her many infidelities. Renowned artists and sculptors pleaded for her to be their next subject. American portrait painter John Singer Sargent was the chosen one. But despite the suggestions of a notorious sex life, his interest in this exotic and intelligent woman, a kindred spirit of sorts, grows beyond the aesthetic, then beyond the physical. On May 1, 1884 an anxious crowd waits impatiently to preview Sargent's new work of art. When Gautreau is shown with the diamond-studded strap of her black gown fallen off her pale, almost lavender-toned shoulder, high society is mortified by the eroticism; the public revels in the news of this fiasco, which spreads like wildfire. Sargent is weak and flees to London; Amelie Gautreau, still believing the painting to be a work of genius, withers in abandonment and humiliation.
