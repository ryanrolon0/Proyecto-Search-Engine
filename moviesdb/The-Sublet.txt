The Sublet

 WALTER is lonely. He is 71 and has no friends. He lives in a small apartment in Upper West Side in Manhattan and every morning he goes through the same monotonous routine the book with all his expenses. His apartment is very quiet until today when his phone rings, which really surprises him. It's a wrong number, someone was looking for a sublet. However, it gives him an idea, a fake ad.
