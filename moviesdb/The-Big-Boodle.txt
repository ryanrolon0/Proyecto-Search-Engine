The Big Boodle

 Ned Sherwood, dealer in a Havana casino (pre-Castro), gets 500 counterfeit pesos from an anonymous, attractive blonde. Then he's beaten and wounded by two thugs trying to retrieve the bills. Then the police suspect him of being the counterfeiter. Then the real counterfeiter suspects him of having the missing plates. And someone is trying to kill Ned, who has little choice but to pursue the case himself, through a Cuban underworld where no one is what they seem.
