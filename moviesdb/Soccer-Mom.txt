Soccer Mom

 Absolutely nothing is sacred in the lives of two best friends forced into domestic duties. Mark Smith and Jim Jones have been enjoying life as corporate execs and next door neighbors. Their lives are about to change as they take a ride in the fast lane as Soccer Moms! The sun rises on a cool, Fall morning in a small West Texas Town. All seems normal, birds are singing, dogs are barking, and alarm clocks are chiming. All are welcoming the new day. Two families, The Smiths and The Jones, best of friends, both raising three children are a part of the morning mix to get the kids up and ready for school. Mrs. Jones awakes, turns on the coffee pot and writes out the kids schedule, domestic chores, and errands for the day. She takes a deep breath and wonders how will it all get done. Mark Smith, next door, is finding it difficult to adjust to his new morning schedule. He hurries to make his protein shake and takes a quick glimpse at the paper. Suddenly, life changes and you have to adjust. Will they survive the day? Nothing stirs up mayhem in a small town like two men who take on cupcake duty, missionaries, and school secretaries!
