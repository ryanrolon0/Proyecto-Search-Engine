They have to unravel clues, follow leads and hope it takes them where they need to go. Alix is a member of an elite drug-task force and is about to retire a wealthy woman. However, moments after she deposits millions of dollars, her children are kidnapped and held for ransom. She turns to her own task force, and their leader, Trapper, for help in hopes of seeking street justice. What she finds is a world of violence unlike anything she's ever seen. She must watch her step and figure out the clues in time to save her kids and herself. One mistake could turn deadly.
