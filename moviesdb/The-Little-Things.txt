The Little Things

 Matthew J. Willing thought the days of wine and roses were a consummation devoutly to be wished! What could be more sublime than a woman who shows her affection with the gift of a simple rose? At least that's what he thought until he made a big mistake on the night of his one year anniversary. With "frienemies", like his roommate Brett, and temptation all around, where does he turn when things go south with everything? The truth may be stranger than any pulp romance novel that he's ever read. He's going to find that it's "the little things" that makes life so sweet.
