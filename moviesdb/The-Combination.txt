The Combination

 Set in the maligned western suburbs of Sydney, Lebanese-Australian John gets out of gaol to discover his younger brother Charlie is caught up with drugs, hookers and crime. Charlie oscillates between the streets and school. Daily clashes between Scott and Charlie's gang escalate. This feud spills into the streets in a territory and identity battle that turns bloody. The Combination dares to shed light on the racial tension that has often boiled over into incidents like the Cronulla riots. Suburban stereotypes are challenged when John falls for an Australian girl named Sydney. She presents an opportunity for a new start - yet with each step closer to her he is made painfully aware of the choice he will have to make - family or love.
