Portrait of a Monster

 The journey on which a hitman goes from being a stone cold killer, to a man who wants to be remembered by something other than killing. It is a transitional piece that shows a warm heart in a man who is cold in nature and how he wants to be better; all from a hit that involved a girl that he had a brief glimpse of what it could be like to have a relationship with her.
