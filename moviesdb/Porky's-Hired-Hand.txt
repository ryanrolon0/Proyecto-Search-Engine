Porky's Hired Hand

 Porky hires on Gregory Grunt to watch over his chicken coop to stop the fox from raiding it. He falls asleep, and the fox fills his bag. But Grunt wakes up and confronts the fox who then talks him into becoming his partner. As the fox is leaving, he locks himself into the incubator room by mistake. Porky hears the noise and comes running.
