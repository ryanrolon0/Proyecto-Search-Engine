Super Tuesday Live in Paris!

 "Super Tuesday Live in Paris!" is about Americans living abroad in Paris, voting live and in person for the very first time in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primaries. It's also part of a bigger story, about Americans everywhere motivated to get involved in the 2008 Presidential election and bring about a change in direction for America following the past 8 years under President Bush. The film takes place Tuesday February 5 and 12, at the American Church, the Paris polling place organized by Democrats Abroad, France. Voters and volunteers are asked several questions,including "What motivated you to come and vote?", "What are the important issues for America today?" and talk about the candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Responses are Candid, heartfelt and insightful, showing strong emotions about the US and its place in the world and their feelings about being American. Key issues included the Iraq war,the US foreign policy, the need for health care reform in the US, the faltering US economy, poverty and more. An eye-opener!
