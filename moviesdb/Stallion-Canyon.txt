Stallion Canyon

 Just as Curt Benson and his men finish rounding up a herd of wild horses for the Curley Q ranch, owned by Aunt Milly, a wild stallion runs toward the corral and stampedes the herd before he can be stopped. Curt suspects the stallion was let loose on purpose by someone who is anxious to keep Aunt Milly from recouping recent losses. He and Little Bear set out to get the evidence to prove that. Curt suspects rancher Tom Lawson and Little Bear goes to investigate the Lawson ranch. Lawson kills one his henchmen for knowing too much and the blame is laid on Little Bear. Curt now has the task of clearing his friend and saving the ranch from foreclosure.
