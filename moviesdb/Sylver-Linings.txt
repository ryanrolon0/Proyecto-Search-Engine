Sylver Linings

 Dean Dennis is a ruthless advertising executive. For Dean, human compassion and reasoning have been ironed away from his soul like the creases in his suit. And his colleagues are as inanimate to him as the products he has to sell. But times are now hard and with Dean being given one last chance to prove himself by taking on a new loophole-exploiting TV campaign for 'Sylver Lining' cigarettes, how far will he go to score big, regardless of the consequences to his soul?
