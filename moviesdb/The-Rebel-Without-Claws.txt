The Rebel Without Claws

 The Confederate Army wants to get an "important message" through to Gen. Lee, but all the carrier pigeons have been shot down. The soldiers reluctantly decide to use Tweety Bird to deliver the message. The Union soldiers counter with their "Messenger Destroyer," who (appropriately enough) turns out to be Sylvester. Battle gags ensue repeatedly blown out of a cannon; Tweety tricks he puddy tat (for a moment, at least) into thinking Union soldiers are marching to battle; and Tweety hiding behind cannons on a fighter ship, resulting in Sylvester getting blown up some more. Ending gag himself as the South's army general, but it is the puddy tat (not Tweety) who gets it on the firing range. Sylvester got nine lives. With this kind of an army, I'll need them!" Tweety is a messenger bird for the Confederate Army, while Sylvester Cat is dispatched by the Yankees as a "Secret Messenger Destroyer" to stop Tweety from reaching General Lee with a very important document.
