The Z's

 The Zs is a dark satire set in the city of Tijuana. Harlan (Doug Lay) and Flordelle (Dana Hooley) visit the city of Tijuana after reading the guide book Tijuana for dummies. Their plan is to buy tons of pharmaceutical drugs and smuggle them back into the United Status in pinatas. While in Tijuana they start drinking booze, taking pills and wander the hellish streets drugged and confused until they end up in a house with a family of Zombies known as The Zs.
