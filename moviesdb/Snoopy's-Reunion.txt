Snoopy's Reunion

 Years ago, at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, a unique litter is born. With members including Snoopy, Spike and Belle, they grow up healthy and a good music band. However, they become separated as they become sold including Snoopy. Years later, Charlie Brown can't help but notice how depressed his dog is. He suggests that Snoopy's family should have a family reunion. The whole gang enthusiastically responds, and even when they return their birthplace for the shindig only to learn that things have changed, nothing changes the joy of reunion, or the chance for making some good music.
