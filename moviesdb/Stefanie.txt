Stefanie

 War orphan Stephanie lives together with her two older brothers Johannes and Andreas in poverty-stricken conditions. But she suffers more under being treated like an immature kid and often reacts stubborn and enraged. Only when she meets Johannes' boss and he starts taking polite paternal interest in her, she suddenly starts to mature - believing he's romancing her.
