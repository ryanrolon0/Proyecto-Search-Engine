The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time

 Christopher is a young boy who suffers from Autism. Though he has a general understanding of the world around him, he cannot fathom what emotions are and takes absolutely everything at face value. When a neighbour's dog is killed, he decides to find out who did it, over the protestations of his caring but frustrated father. However, Christopher's investigation leads him to some very unexpected places, and force him to confront his own family's past.
