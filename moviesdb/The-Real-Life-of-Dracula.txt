The Real Life of Dracula

 It is not an ordinary documentary because it contains not only facts for a normal life but facts for a person who had all the attributes to become a legend, even beyond... The Bram Stoker's character "Dracula" was and still is in our minds a character who, in a way, cheats death, being not too far from the real Vlad the Impaler Dracula (1431 - 1476).
