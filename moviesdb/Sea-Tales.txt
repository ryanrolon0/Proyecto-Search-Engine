Sea Tales

 Sea Tales is a collection of the world's most beloved fairy tales set in a vivid underwater world of fantasy. Each animated Sea Tale is one of over a hundred classics born from the minds of Robert Lewis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde and Hans Christian Anderson to name a few. Stories like The Three 3 Little Sea Pigs, Snow White And The Seven Hermit Crabs, The Happy Sea Prince, The Ugly Duckling's Artic Adventure, Thumbelina's Underwater Adventure and The Selfish Sea Giant are thoughtfully adapted and re-cast using wonderful and whimsical creatures of the sea. Furthermore, each beautifully animated tale is narrated by some of Hollywood's best-loved talents, such as Larry King, Betty White and Gene Simmons. More than just a humongous splash of fun, each Sea Tale conveys the importance of things in life such as friendship, family, hope and telling the truth, making it a perfect addition to any children's library.
