Puppet Master II

 Toulon's puppets help collect brain tissue from human victims for Toulon to create his formula to animate the inanimate. The victims this time include a group of researchers from a US department, responsible for invstigating the paranormal. The puppets return the original master, Andre Toulon, back to life inorder for him to help them kill and collect brains for more fluid for them to live off for another half century. And when a inspective group come to the hotel believe in nothing but Alex Whitaker's stories they keep watch, and throughout the movie they are hunted down one by one for their brains and when Andre sees Carolyn Bramwell who looks just like his dead wife Elsa, everything goes to hell.
