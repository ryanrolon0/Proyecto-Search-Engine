The Danger of Secrets

 Like the real social guidance films of the 50s, 60s and 70s that had characters like Bert the Turtle telling kids to "stop, drop and roll", this short satirizes U.S. 'mental hygiene' propaganda; it warns little Billy of the danger of secrets in the lives of his parents and his aunt as their 'grown-up' party grows out of control with jazz cigarettes, beatniks and foreign guests.
