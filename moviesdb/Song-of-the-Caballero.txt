Song of the Caballero

 After El Lobo robs Don Jose he gives one of the stolen items to Conchita. Later when he saves Anita in a runaway coach, Don Pedro invites him to the wedding of Anita and his son Don Jose. But Conchita is at the wedding and recognizes him putting his life in danger. Don Pedro Madera drives his sister from the Madera rancho because he is displeased she has married a gringo. Sister and gringo have a son Juan who, years later when he is grown, is seeking revenge, as the bandit El Lobo against Madera. The latter does not know that El Lobo/Juan is his nephew. As Juan, he saves the life of Anita, whose hand is promised to Jose Madera, but she is attracted to Juan and he is invited to a fiesta at the rancho. There, he is recognized as the bandit El Lobo by Conchita, a girl who gets around. Some of her getting around includes being caught in the arms of Jose the cad, and this leads to Madera learning that Juan is really his nephew, Jose being a whole lot discredited and Madera blessing a marriage between Juan and Anita.
