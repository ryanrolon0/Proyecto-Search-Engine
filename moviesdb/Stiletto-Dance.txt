 Undercover detectives Kit Adrian and Jay Flowers have, as ex-cons, won the trust of immigrated Russian ex-communist crime lord Anton Seaberg. Captain Rick Sands gives them permission to go to extraordinarily lengths, even eliminate other criminals, because Anton stole enough plutonium from Chechenia to sell to terrorists. FBI agent Simi Aberts is captured while observing Anton, ignorant of the undercover operation. As if that weren't dangerous enough, Kit has an affair with Lena, Anton's trusted torturer-executioner Rolfe's daredevil wife.
