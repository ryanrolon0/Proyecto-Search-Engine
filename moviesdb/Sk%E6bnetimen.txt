Skæbnetimen

 Cecilie is the host of one of Primetime-TV's popular programmes, "Destiny Hour", and she plans a scoop by using a Turkish woman in her programme. Cecilie wants to give the Turkish woman the chance to emancipate herself from her fundamentalist husband on live TV. But the husband kidnaps Cecilie's dog and goes to the rivalling channel! And so the media war rages.
