Vivir es una obra maestra

 To be an artist is to turn any object into a magical one. That was the aim of one of the most brilliant writers and artists of the 20th Century, Jorge Eielson. Eielson's desire to avoid notoriety, and a fifty-three year exile, made him a legendary name - not only in the European art world, but in his home country of Peru. In "Virir en una obra maestra" Gabriela Yepes explores Eielson's luminous art and incredible life.
