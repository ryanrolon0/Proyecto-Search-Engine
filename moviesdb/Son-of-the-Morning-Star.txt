Son of the Morning Star

 The life of George Armstrong Custer comes alive in this made for television movie. The story of vain, headstrong, and ambitious George Armstrong Custer and his Post-Civil War career (1866-1876) on the Great Plains. A parallel story of the life of Native American inspirational hero Crazy Horse is crosscut with Custer's, two lives that will intertwine and culminate with the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. Opposing points of view on the same events by narrators speaking from opposite perspectives, Custer's beloved wife Libby and Indian woman Kate Bighead.
