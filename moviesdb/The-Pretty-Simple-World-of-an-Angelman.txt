The Pretty Simple World of an Angelman

 The Pretty Simple World of an Angelman is a biography on Harley Votano who was born with Angelmans Syndrome. We track a regular Sunday in his life and contrast his unique perspective with that of his younger brother Cameron as they both prepare for a junior rugby league match with the help of their much loved mother.
