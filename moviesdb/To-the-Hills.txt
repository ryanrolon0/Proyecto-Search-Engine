To the Hills

 Lot of ambitious, crazy characters show how to follow their schemes to become rich and famous. A wig salesman tries to get ahead with new wig technology such as "air conduction" and "stainless steel clamps". A yoga specialist incorporates modern dance moves and ridiculous nose breathing. And Secret Agent Delgado "puts the word DISCIPLINE back into interior decorating and home garden design." And there are a lot more characters where those came from.
