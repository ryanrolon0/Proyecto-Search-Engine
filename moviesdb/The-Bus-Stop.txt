The Bus Stop

 The be-speckled Tyler draws a comic-book fight ("Kapow!") one morning just before his mother tells him that he'll have to take the school bus today. He walks reluctantly and with trepidation toward the corner of Owl Creek and Bridge, where lots of kids already await the bus. The boys pick on Tyler, and before the bus arrives, he's been knocked down and his lunch vandalized. Then, after the bus is hijacked by three armed men - at least one has an Arabic name - who use a cell phone to demand money and the release of political prisoners, Tyler opens his portable chemistry set and sets to work on an escape plan. Is heroism just around the corner?
