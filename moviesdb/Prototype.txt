Prototype

 Growing up in the shadow of Sin City Alex Mackendrick lives a pretty ordinary life devoid of excitement. Alex has never had the power to stand up for himself. Since the death of his mother, he has been floating through life letting people take advantage of him, clinging to the hope that one day he will find his calling in the world. Lately he has been seeking that calling in the way of church with his mentor Father Bruce. He desperately wants to do something great and he knows stocking the shelves at the local warehouse store is not it.
