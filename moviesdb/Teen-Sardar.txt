Teen Sardar

 Muscle-man Sherdil is told by his mentor that he must avenge his father's death by overthrowing the oppressive and tyrannical Wazir of Husnabad, Suleiman. Sherdil sets off to do so and is assisted by Feroz, another muscle-man. They find their way to Husnabad but things go very wrong as they end up captives to Suleiman, who has imprisoned Malika-e-Alam, as well as allegedly killed her daughter Shehzadi Nilofer.
