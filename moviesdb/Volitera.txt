Volitera

 Armed with a selection of powerful new tracks written after recording their debut record, Bristol Metal band Volitera embark on their first UK tour. On the way they win a new bands competition, loose a roadie to the Weston Super Mare night then make it back to Bristol in time for their homecoming show before splitting up.
