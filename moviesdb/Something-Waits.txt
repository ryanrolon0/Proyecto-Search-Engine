Something Waits

 A newly married couple buy a large fixer-upper. They're not quite sure why they received such a good deal on the house but soon find out that it's because of rumors of a murder that happened long ago. When the husband is called away on business, his young wife is left alone to finish moving in. As the night unfolds, she begins noticing odd things happening in the house. She dismisses them as her imagination. Is it just her imagination or is it really the ghost of another young wife? Only time will tell if she survives the night.
