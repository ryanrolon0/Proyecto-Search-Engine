Riptide

 Daring modern day pirate, a guy with a touch of "Robinhood" in his soul, Rip Fuentes, appears to come to the aid of an adventuresome heiress, Gina Northwell.  Her brother's been kidnapped, and she's in the Caribbean to pay off his kidnappers and bring him home.  Rick's really after the $20 million ransom, but can he steal it if she's stolen his heart?
