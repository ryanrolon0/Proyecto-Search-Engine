Tabor

 Nestled on the plains of South Dakota, on just one half of a square mile lies the tiny town of Tabor, population 417. Like so many other small rural communities, the struggle to stay alive despite the growth of nearby large retail centers and the changing rural landscape is constant. However, every year for one very special weekend the people of the town come together to celebrate the heritage of their Czechoslovakian founders and ancestors. On that third weekend in June, the sleepy town awakes in a flurry of music, food, and good cheer that is unmatched for a community of its size. Thousands visit the tiny town and become swept up in the spirit that is Tabor. In her directorial debut, Aesli Grandi captures the small town's spirit of community that permeates life and shows how the celebration of the town's past allows for a brighter future. More than a documentary of a single town, it is a snapshot of one colorful piece of the fabric that is America.
