The Floor

 The Floor is a raw, quirky, edgy half hour comedy about a group of oddball telemarketers of "First Toner", a copy toner company. This dingy boiler room environment is guaranteed (for thirty days excluding CA & FL) to bring out the best and worst of buyers and sellers alike. The show follows our hero, Tony De Fucio, the most popular sales rep on "The Floor". He and an ensemble group of misfits work as telemarketers while trying to fulfill their Hollywood dreams.
