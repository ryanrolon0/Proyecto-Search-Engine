To Build a Better Mousetrap

 Mice invade a kitchen, late at night, pushing a large cheese from the counter to the floor. They begin the divide it up when strains of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" fill the air, an opening in the wainscoting appears, and out rolls Blackmire Industries' Merchant of Death 2000, the ultimate mousetrap. The mice scatter, but the Merchant chases them down and delivers certain death with various apparatuses, including a blender and a mallet. "Let all mice beware," intones the unseen narrator of this convincing commercial.
