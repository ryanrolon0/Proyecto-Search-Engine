The Nature of Battle

 The film starts by revealing a destroyed city. Bombed out buildings and piles of metal litter the gray landscape. Flags flap restlessly in the wind, and a lonely raven pokes amongst the rubble; the few sources of life in this desolate environment. On the horizon planes slowly approach. Their cargo is deployed over the city and it falls rapidly through the clouds. What more could be done to a place so brutally raped by mankind in one of their darkest hours? In a vivid and explosive sequence, the true purpose of this bombing run is revealed.
