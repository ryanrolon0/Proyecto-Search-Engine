Tutti all'attacco

 Max Bernabei is a football coach who has never been very successful, preferring to spend his time training up the team of the local psychiatric centre. But his luck changes when he is called upon to train the soccer team of the Tuscan city in which he lives, Collenovo soccer team, but is given a disastrous budget. To save the situation they hire five Chinese players - the Wong siblings who are passionate about 'Shaolin soccer'.
