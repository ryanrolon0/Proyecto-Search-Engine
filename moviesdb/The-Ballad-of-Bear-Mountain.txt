The Ballad of Bear Mountain

 An adventurous girl on a quest to find a home visits the habitats of a variety of forest denizens. Despite the hospitality of her hosts, she is unable to find comfort in their dwellings. Lost in the forest, cold and alone, she gives up hope until she finds acceptance and the meaning of 'home' from an unexpected friend.
