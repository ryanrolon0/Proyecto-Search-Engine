Quacker Tracker

 The Tooth & Nail Hunting Society is offering a reward to anyone who can bag their only missing trophy, Speedy Gonzales. Daffy's just the fool to do it. Daffy tries telling Speedy his shotgun is a telescope, but Speedy convinces Daffy to look. Daffy tries a snare, but it doesn't work until he steps into it to figure out what's wrong. An exploding girl mouse doll keeps finding its way back to Daffy. Daffy disguises himself as a giant enchilada, but the mice squirt hot sauce on him. Finally, Daffy rides a rocket, but ends up running into a train which throws him right back through the hunting society's roof.
