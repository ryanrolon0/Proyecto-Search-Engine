The Cat's Meow

 Local peeping tom, Warren, is driving the locals crazy; especially his neighbor Lloyd. One day a new neighbor moves into town, a single woman named Lawna. Warren decides it's time to peep on her. When Lloyd disappears, and Warren's pet cat shows up with a little surprise, Lawna turns her attention to Warren.
