Porky the Wrestler

 Porky, along with everyone else, is hitchhiking to the big wrestling match. He gets a ride from the challenger, but at the arena, Porky is mistaken for the challenger and gets thrown into the ring. The champ is making mincemeat of Porky when Porky crawls out and has the champ tying himself in knots, then swallowing a spectator's pipe and doing a steam locomotive impression.
