Silver Lake

 Each year over 900,000 people are reported missing. In the fall of 1990, at a cabin near Silver Lake, four young couples became part of that statistic. Now, twenty years later and from across the country, their children return to the cabin looking for answers. Armed with evidence that may lead to the discovery of what really happened in those woods, this group of seven estranged friends find out that some things are best left unknown.
