The Hook-Armed Man

 Lou is the Hook-Armed Man, the bloody stalker of urban legend. Night after night he terrorizes teenage lovers in the woods. But he's tired of the killing and the maiming. He goes to a job counselor, looking to redeem himself in a new vocation - if only he can avoid falling back into bad habits.
