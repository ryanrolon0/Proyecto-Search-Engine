Sunset Trail

 Keller buys Marsh's cattle and then murders him to retrieve the money. But Ann Marsh remembered some of the serial numbers and this is the clue that Hoppy needs. He arrives posing as a dude. He also poses as a novice poker player and this brings in a few of the stolen bills. When he realizes Keller is the one he is after, he wins back all the money at the poker table. He escapes from Keller's saloon but Keller and his men head out after him. In the 22nd film of the series John Marsh, a successful rancher, decides to retire to Sacramento with his wife, Ann, and his daughter, Dorrie, in order to give Dorrie a good education. Monte Keller, owner of the Silver City Casino, buys Marsh's cattle for $30,000, then waylays the stagecoach, shoots Marsh dead from ambush, and takes the money from his pocket. Ann reports to the Superintendent of the stage company, and gives him the numbers of some of the bank notes. He suggests that Ann should open a dude ranch and promises to send her some guests, among them his friend William H. Cassidy. Working undercover for the stage line, "Lucky" Jenkins and "Windy" Halliday come to Silver City while their friend, "Hopalong" Cassidy arrives at the ranch as an eastern dude costumed in furry chaps, a vest made from a spotted cowhide and a bow-tie. Ann is a bit disappointed to learn that the man who is going to get her money recovered is a nervous man who can't even mount a horse properly. Cassidy frequents the casino and soon wins one of the stolen notes in a poker game. This leads him to the ranch's foreman, Steve Dorman, and then to the big boss. A rancher is murdered and Hoppy goes undercover, disguised as an Easterner unfamiliar with the ways of the West, making a fool of himself in order to capture the killers.
