 Daniel is a young man suffering from low self-esteem, who is incapable of defending himself from the abuses of employers and of society in general. He is medicated with antidepressants to make his monotonous life more bearable; however, far from helping him, the medication worsens his condition with hallucinations and psychotic thoughts of vengeance that lead him to a state of total confusion between reality and his imagination.
