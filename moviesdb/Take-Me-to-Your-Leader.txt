Take Me to Your Leader

 After a string of unsuccessful career choices including hairdressing and pub fitting, fifty five year old Yorkshireman Corbin West decides to turn his hand to filmmaking. Armed with ambition, money from a local double-glazing firm and no talent whatsoever, Corbin begins to assemble a cast and crew for his biggest project to date, a feature length sci-fi movie called Take Me To Your Leader. But will he get Kurt Russell for the lead? Will anyone turn up for the screening? And can he ever forgive his estranged mum for calling him Shirley? Take Me To Your Leader is a raw and comedic journey of one man's struggle for success and recognition.
