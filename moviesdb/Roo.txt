Roo

 ROO started as a favor for my father. He was retiring and closing the cotton manufacturing factory that he had worked at since his arrival to America from India in the late 60's. I wanted to document the factory as a family memoir and a reminder of how my family arrived in America. However, the more I learned about my father's past, the more I realized how amazing he is and his story is. He raised three children without once making us realize the sacrifices he made in order to give us the best possible life.
