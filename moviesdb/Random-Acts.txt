Random Acts

 "Random Acts" is the story of the straw that broke the camels back. Claire, a single mother, just wants to follow a simple dream. Simple enough, except didn't she once promise to love honor and cherish another dream? Her ex-husband thinks so and cannot let go even after seven years, until, finally, he entraps her in a random act of violence. But Claire isn't giving up her children. The stakes can be no higher and Claire must fight and pray for a random act of kindness.
