Traffic Regulations

 A speaker on a stage presents a report on the traffic conditions in the theater district of New York City, which he says have improved considerably. After giving some examples of how bad the traffic in the area has been in the past, he displays a large map of the district. He then uses the map to point out landmarks and recommended routes.
