Steves

 STEVES is a simple fish out of water story, about Ashley & Derek, a young L.A. couple who travel to the mountains of Montana in search of some peace and quiet away from the distractions of Hollywood at the Lonely Hearts Dude Ranch. Derek's fun is quickly spoiled by suspicion of their unsettling host, The Chef and his Steves, a team of strange and scary ranch hands. While Ashley falls in love with the place, Derek's trip descends into terror as he sets out to discover exactly what the Lonely Hearts Dude Ranch is serving up at the dinner table. Just remember
