The Making of 'Blast and Whisper'

 The modern era's atheistic movements of Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, Pol Pot, and others left body counts to dwarf all religious strife over the centuries combined. Yet the horrors of religious executions continue to ring down the centuries even until Sept 11th. The unified respect of Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and Muslims for Elijah's story is an astonishing phenomenon! We join cast and crew as they struggle to film one of the most amazing stories ever cherished by generations of people of faith in one true God. Meet Director Mark Moran, UPM Dan Fiehtner, co-star Libertad Green, and rising star Cali Rossen as we take the exciting journey of the Making of 'Blast and Whisper.' Despite the magnificent success of The Passion of the Christ, movies based on the bible still tend to face stiff resistance that many other productions happily are spared. Director Mark Moran, along with his cast and crew of die-hards including Libertad Green, AJ Faraj, and Dan Fiehtner, set out to adapt the story of Elijah the prophet. The result was 'Blast and Whisper', AKA The Story of Elijah, shot in HD on the Panasonic AG-HVX200 (Cloverfield minus the spastic camera shakes). The Making of 'Blast and Whisper' chronicles the far-reaching need for this movie, the challenges and triumphs of Mark Moran in his journey from bible to script to feature film, and the fascinating anecdotes of cast and crew. The Making of 'Blast and Whisper' includes behind-scenes footage and a series of fascinating interviews that establish not only the power of the Blast and Whisper motion picture but also the credibility of the Breadwin Productions team who pieced the puzzle together.
