The Great White

 Sidney O'McConnor is a high school student with Asperger's Syndrome. He has no friends at school and a troubled life at home. He is obsessed with sharks and his fellow classmate, Kylie Hafflyte, who takes him out to smoke marijuana together one night. However, she only takes him out as a shared joke within the school, and his classmates take advantage of that fact. Sidney is troubled by this, and continues to seek Kylie, even when she leaves school. Eventually, Sidney's two obsessions intertwine in a strange way on Halloween night.
