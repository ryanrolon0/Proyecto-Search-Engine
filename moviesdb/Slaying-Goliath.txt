Slaying Goliath

 SLAYING GOLIATH takes an unprecedented intimate look at the world of amateur youth basketball through the eyes of the New York Select Huskies team as they seek to win the AAU National Basketball Championship. The grueling price the team must pay to win exposes the hidden dark side of amateur sports. SLAYING GOLIATH takes a charged look at 10 days in the life of a boy's fifth grade basketball club from Harlem, New York. The film follows the children's parents - including the filmmakers and their own son, who is on the team - as they travel to the AAU National Championships in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Whole worlds are laid bare with skillful economy, as grown ups and coaches grapple with the sometimes diverging demands of parenting and winning. The difficulties of raising black boys, as well as the difficulties of being a real team, come to the fore as the group frays, while tantalizing questions of how filmmakers should document the events of their own lives hovers around GOLIATH's edges.
