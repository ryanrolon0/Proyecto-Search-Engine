The Middle Man

 C.M.S is a strange and curious disease that can best be described as chronic laziness and it destroys the lives of the people afflicted with it. There is no real medical treatment of C.M.S. but strides are being made to rehabilitate individuals who have it by true heroes called Middle Men, who live with its victims 24/7. This film documents the trials of Ed Torpid and his Middle Man as they do everything in their power to get Ed back in to civilization. This is a bittersweet story of hope and love.
