Scenes from Oblivion

 Spawned from a strict Catholic upbringing, Tommy has grown into a young man set in his ways. As he reconciles with family friend Misha Bravo, a manic depressive and independent-thinker whom he has been enamored with since his teens, Tommy is thrust into her opposing mind-frame and punk philosophy. Misha Bravo is a manic depressive, an independent-thinker and punk rocker. Tommy Buscavida is an idealist, a Catholic and virgin. Through flashbacks and a fractured narrative a cultural osmosis forms as these two stubborn and would-be lovers begin to clash and slowly question their morality and opposing hostility.
