The Poet Laureate of Radio

 Known as the Poet Laureate of Radio, Norman Corwin is one of the greatest writer-producer-directors the Golden Age of Radio ever produced. Originally interviewed by Michael James Kacey for his documentary film "Radio Changed America", Mr. Corwin suggested that this interview be made available to the public. Corwin's insights range from his earliest recollections of radio to topics such as fascism, the obligation of an artist, the art of directing, and even William Shatner.
