Slender Existence

 Slender Existence is the first-ever personal film about surviving anorexia nervosa. Filmmaker Laura Murray interweaves her own fractured recollections of starvation with those of her family and closest high school friend - all of whom rally to her support. This intimate and touching self-portrait shows a family dealing with a child's eating disorder - and that child growing into a healthy adult.
