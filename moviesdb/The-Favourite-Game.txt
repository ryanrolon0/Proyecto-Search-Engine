The Favourite Game

 Leo is a free spirit with childlike eyes, who likes to write poems about his feelings in the Here and Now, and the intense moments that he shares with women. They feel attracted to him, fall in love with him, but as their relationship evolves, they can't help but asking Leo for more - a commitment, a future together.
