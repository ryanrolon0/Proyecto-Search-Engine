The Puppeteers

 One of the most famous Italian families of the puppet theater. The Puppeteers combines passionate interviews with the Ferrari family, Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Fo with archival materials and live performances to tell the triumphant yet tragic story of a family's love affair with an art form in decline. Bernardo Bertolucci tells us how he much he enjoyed casting them in his film '900', clips from film included.
