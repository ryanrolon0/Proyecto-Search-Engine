Shwet Angaar

 It is not just a story of a poor farmer, who struggles hard for his own and his family's survival... A story not just about the pitiable and non-productive situation of an agricultural product like cotton... The callous policies of Government The entire ruthless system... It is a story about the Fate of a farmer... Who has no hope for change... Driving him towards a dead end...
