Thinking Speed

 An unassuming reader picks up a killer's autobiography and is transferred to her execution. Thinking this bizarre episode was a waking dream, the reader attempts to check out of the store where the book was purchased only to find the killer controls the shop and is taking the reader hostage. The two travel through time in order to change a series of events until the reader discovers a terrifying secret.
