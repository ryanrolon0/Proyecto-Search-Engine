Super Mario 64

 Bowser has infiltrated Peach's Castle, and stole the power of the Stars, leaving the Princess and all of her friends trapped in the castle walls; so Mario sets out to retrieve the 120 Stars and defeat the Koopa King once again. One day Mario is invited to Peach's castle to receive a delicious cake. When the Italian hero arrives, low and behold is Bowser's evil doings who has taken all the castle's stars and encased Peach within the castle. Mario must rescue Peach and stop the evil Bowser. Of all the items in the Mushroom Kingdom, the Power Stars are the most magical and powerful. These 120 stars power Princess Toadstool's castle. One day, the Princess invites Mario over for a cake-but while he's getting there, Bowser is invading! The King of the Koopas goes into Mushroom Castle and steals most of the power stars-the others are hidden by Peach and her Toad subjects. But alas-Bowser takes enough to not only create his own strange and twisted worlds from paintings in the castle, but to imprison Peach and her Toads in the castle walls themselves! But Bowser didn't count on one mustached plumber, whose mission is to recover the stolen stars and bring their power back!
