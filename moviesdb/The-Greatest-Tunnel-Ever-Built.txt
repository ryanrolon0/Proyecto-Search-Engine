The Greatest Tunnel Ever Built

 A documentary special presenting the history of the Sandhogs urban miners who for 150 years have carved tunnels into the city's bedrock, making life possible for the millions above. For the last 40 years, they've been working on a job called, simply, Water Tunnel #3. Don't let the name fool you western hemisphere. This film tells the story of that project. As it does, it provides a look inside this storied brotherhood. We meet the union's veteran mouthpiece, who is taking on a protoge as he nears retirement. We watch a "shaper" try to break into the union. And a steely boss readies his gang for a precarious blast, with fate of the city at stake. As per usual, New York's future rests on the shoulders of the it's tunnel workers, the Sandhogs. As per usual, the men are up to the task. This is their story.
