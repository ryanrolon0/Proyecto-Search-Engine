The Freak

 The Freak is a warped mutation that lives in the hum-drum city of symmetry and order where the "normal" inhabitants plod through their daily grind like Sims. He emerges from the sewers one day to dance in the streets and is immediately thrown into jail. There, the Sims study him in a dungeon reminiscent of that in "Brazil" and populated with other Freaks. He is given two pictures to choose from # a normal one and a freakish one. Of course, "The Freak" always chooses the freakish one, and because of this he is thrown into a padded cell.
