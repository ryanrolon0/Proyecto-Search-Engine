Shabbat Shalom

 Set in an inconspicuous suburban town in Washington State, Shabbat Shalom gives a raw, intimate perspective on a Romanian mother/daughter relationship rooted in tender Jewish traditions. Through cooking preparations and cultural rituals chronicled in one cold December week, the women prepare a unique, candle-lit Shabbat dinner, and share much more.
