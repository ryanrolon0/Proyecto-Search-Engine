The Walled City

 In 1842, when Hong Kong became a British colony, The Kowloon Walled City, a military fort, was abandoned by the Chinese, but never officially handed over to the British, creating a political black hole. It was a haven to Triads and other illegal activities, since the colonial government technically could not administer what was still a Chinese territory. It was also a refuge for a hard working people that called it simply, home. In a series of surrealistic events, the two characters of the film emerge from their paintings of one another. The paintings offer a window to memories and experiences. The film suggests these paintings are not exclusively made by the characters, but perhaps are apparitions, memories of a lost city, awaiting demolition.
