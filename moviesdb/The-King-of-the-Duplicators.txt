The King of the Duplicators

 This short shows how 'William Tuttle (I)' (qv), chief of MGM's makeup department for over 30 years, makes life masks of performers. These masks allow makeup artists to test various types of makeup and appliances (e.g., beards, false noses) on an actor's face without the person actually being there. The life masks of several stars, past and present, are shown hanging on a wall in the makeup room.
