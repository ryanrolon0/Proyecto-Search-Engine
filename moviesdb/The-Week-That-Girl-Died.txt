The Week That Girl Died

 The lives of three lifelong buddies in a small New England fishing town will never be the same after The Week That Girl Died, a touching romantic comedy about finding Ms. Right-at all the wrong times. Vinnie (Erik Palladino) bumps into the attractive Jessie(Brigitte Bako) at his uncle's wake, and when his aunt mistakes her for his latest girlfriend, she gladly plays the part-leaving out one small detail. Jimmy(Robert Longstreet) sets his sights on the seedy part of town-only to find love (Justina Machado) waiting for him in the least likely of places. And Ralph (Patrick Fischler) woke up a virgin on Friday morning only to have that situation reversed two times over by Saturday night. With an original score by jazz musician Kevin Eubanks (The Tonight Show with Jay Leno) "The Week That Girl Died" takes the notion of the romantic comedy and gives it a dose of what real people go through. Three best friends embark on new relationships in the same week with varying results. One sees a woman that he is extremely attracted to in a peep show and then runs into her on the street and finds her more intelligent than her job might lead one to expect. A second meets a woman at his uncle's funeral and starts a wild affair, which involves public sex, not knowing that she is married. The third, who struggles with relationships, de-flowers an over-weight woman at her request before she enters a convent. Then he gets a break with the waitress he had been pursuing, only to find it all fall apart when she learns of his night with the other woman. All of the central figures are deceitful in some measure and are struggling to find truthful relationships.
