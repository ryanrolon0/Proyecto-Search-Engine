The Wild Man of Borneo

 In 1902, medicine show con man Dan Thompson settles down with the daughter he hardly knows in a New York theatrical boarding house full of eccentric characters. Forced to take a job in an arcade sideshow, he tries to con daughter Mary and his fellow boarders into thinking he's on the legitimate stage.
