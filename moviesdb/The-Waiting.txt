The Waiting

 Three career crooks gather for a major heist; waiting in uneasy peace for their boss. A young stranger arrives alleging to have been sent by their boss. Only one of the three believes him. Fears and old grievances drive wedges between them. Each man tested to the breaking point as the pressure of their self imposed prison builds inexorably towards an emotionally explosive and group shattering climax.
