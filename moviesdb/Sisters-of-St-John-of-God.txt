Sisters of St John of God

 The Sisters of St John of God have maintained a presence in the Kimberley for nearly 100 years. Throughout this time, their lives have been entwined with the fate of Aboriginal people during times of war, disease and controversial government removalist policies. As the Sisters approach the end of an era, and the end of an order, they search their souls in an examination of their life's work.
