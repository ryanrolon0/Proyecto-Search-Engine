The Brick Street Jugglers

 The Brick Street Jugglers (Painting Space) is a short documentary about a collection of students that come together every week to juggle on their college green. Narrated by the jugglers themselves, this short documentary is a metaphysical examination of a hobby that though often viewed as pure childish spectacle, offers insight to some of life's more pressing existential problems.
