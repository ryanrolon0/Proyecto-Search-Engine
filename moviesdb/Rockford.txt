Rockford

 The movie chronicles the arrival of a (Hindu) student to a strict all-boys Christian boarding school in India and his assimilation into the school. The change is quite dramatic to the protagonist and there are a lot of events that would look extremely abusive to the viewer. Mr. and Mrs. Naidu admit their son, Rajesh Naidu (Rohan Dey) at the Catholic School called Rockford School. There Rajesh is meant to spend his time to learn and play, make enemies and friends. And he does so. He also becomes romantically involved with Malati (Usha Krishnamurthy) from a nearby girls Catholic school. He also gets indirectly involved with Malati's friend, Shariyar (Shilpa Pai), and a School-teacher, who is accused of demanding sexual favors from Shariyar. Apart from coming to the aid of this school-teacher, Rajesh must also endure bullying and ragging by senior boys from this school, and his crush on another school-teacher, Ms. Lily Vegas (Nandita Das).
