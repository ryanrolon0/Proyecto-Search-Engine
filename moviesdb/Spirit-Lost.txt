Spirit Lost

 After John, a painter, and his wife move into an old house on an island, a seductive widow ghost shows up in mirrors, windows and in John's dreams and nightmares. She eventually lures him into moving into his attic studio while she tries to scare his now unhappy and pregnant wife away.
