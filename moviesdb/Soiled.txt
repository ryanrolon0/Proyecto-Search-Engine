Soiled

 Mary Brown, a chorus girl, promises to give herself to John Duane, a playboy cad, in exchange for $2500 so she can pay back a theft her brother has made from his employers. Her sweetheart, race-car driver Jimmie , learns about it and gives her a check for $2500, but the check is worthless unless he can win the Big Race that afternoon. He leads through every lap but blows a tire on the last lap and finishes fourth. It appears that Duane will soon be hugging sweet Mary, unless Jimmie can find a buyer for a race-car with a flat tire.
