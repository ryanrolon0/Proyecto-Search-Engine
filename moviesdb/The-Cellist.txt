The Cellist

 Frank's first short film during his stint at the University of Texas of Arlington introduced him to the friends that would later become major collaborators. The Cellist, from a story by Nicholas Juul, is a montage of music and madness, a coming-of-age story about ego and mis-communication. After stirring heated controversy among the faculty and students for the film's content, it was selected to be the closing night showcase for the 2002 fall semester film festival. Dean of the program and award-winning filmmaker Andy Anderson championed the film, calling it a "breath of fresh air." Starring Nicholas Juul, Frank Mosley, and Victoria Wells.
