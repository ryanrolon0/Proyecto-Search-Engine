Two Boys

 Six days before Christmas. It's warm and sunny. Two recently transplanted New Yorkers are lugging a Christmas tree through the streets of Los Angeles. On one end of the tree is an irritated sixteen-year-old gay boy with quite a mouth on him. On the other end is his recently divorced mother, trying to be patient and positive. Then it's Christmas. Another bright day. However, the night before the boy learned that his best friend committed suicide. How will Mom and Son get through this day?
