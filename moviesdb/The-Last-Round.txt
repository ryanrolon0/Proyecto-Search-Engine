The Last Round

 A cryptic message stenciled on graffiti covered walls brings six strangers together at a desolate location to play Russian roulette. The rules are simple... one spin, six pulls. William B. Davis (The X-Files) portrays the catalyst to this game of desperate souls. In finding men willing to put their lives on the line, six distinct stories unfold. At the table is a troubled, Gulf War veteran; a reckless racecar driver; a self-made millionaire; an elderly man who has lost his wife; a recluse who is afraid to live; and a young man whose life is upended when the unthinkable happens. Weaving between past and present, The Last Round takes us into the darkest, most personal memories of each player.
