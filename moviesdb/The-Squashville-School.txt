The Squashville School

 Teacher favors one pupil and is ousted by the Board of Education, whose daughter resents the favoritism. The 'Board' advertises for a strong woman teacher, and the discharged teacher's sweetheart, disguising himself, gets the position. His conduct of the school is also reported to the 'Board' and he is disciplined in a novel manner. Finally, the 'Board' is persuaded to reinstate the old teacher, to the great joy of all the scholars except the 'Board's' daughter.
