Twice Under

 Cannel expert Ed is asked for advice by the local police in search for the murderer of two sewer-men. Soon Ed realizes that not he's seeking the murderer, but the other way around come for revenge for an incident in Vietnam, where Ed would have let him die. His half-Vietnamese teenage son Rick fears that Ed has no chance against Daggat and hurries after him to help or at least take counter-revenge.
