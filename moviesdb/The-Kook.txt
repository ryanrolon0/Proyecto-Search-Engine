The Kook

 Fa is a gentle and unassuming member of an eccentric religious sect in the Catskill Mountains. On the eve of her group's scheduled "departure from Earth" Fa discovers that their leader, who appears to them as an alien hologram transmitted from a far off galaxy, is crossing signals with a man named Malcolm, who lives nearby. Fa sets out alone into the "real world" to find Malcolm and get to the bottom of this perplexing and untimely miscommunication.
