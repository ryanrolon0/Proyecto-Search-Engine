The Harriman Alaska Expedition Retraced

 In 1899, Edward H. Harriman, the head of the Union Pacific Railroad, organized a sea expedition along the coast of Alaska to study the flora, fauna, and natural wonders of the area. Harriman also intended to bring back specimens of the animals and plants he encountered. The group chosen for the voyage included scientists, artists, and writers. In 2001, 'Tom Litwin' (qv), of the Clark Science Center at Smith College, Lead a similar expedition, retracing as closely as possible the route followed by the Harriman party. Along the way, we see many of the same peoples and places as those on the first expedition. We also see the changes that Alaska has endured in the previous 100 years.
