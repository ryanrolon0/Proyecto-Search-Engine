Volga Volga

 Volga, 35, is a talented young man whose life has been heavily affected by schizophrenia. He lives with his parents who love him dearly but are also emotionally and physically affected by Volga's illness. By documenting the struggle for a 'normal' life and by giving voice also to several members of the Ankara Solidarity Center for Schizophrenic Patients, the film is a reflection on what it means to be touched, directly or indirectly, by an invisible illness, which cannot be healed by time and for this reason leaves deep, visible scars.
