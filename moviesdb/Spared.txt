Spared

 Red Death and Black Death are responsible for taking the lost soul in the back of their hearse to purgatory. Unfortunately, they catch a flat tire and have to take a quick detour to A.J.'s Tires. All hell breaks loose when they lose the dead body and have to replace it with one of the quirky characters they come upon.
