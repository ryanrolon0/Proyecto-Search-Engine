Project MorningStar

 This twisted tale follows a young girls journey into the dark depths of soulful beauty. Guided by The Magician and his band of misfit musicians, she is lead down the mysterious left hand path to a ceremony filled with illusions and visions of the unthinkable. This is not a conventional experimental film, but a horrifically beautiful experience. Pray you get to keep your soul.
