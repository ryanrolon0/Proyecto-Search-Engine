Sci Fi Science

 What first appears to be a send-up of classic science fiction is in fact a thorough examination of the real-world science behind the sensationalism. In the pilot episode, the physics behind a hypothetical alien invasion are explained. With the help of scientists and engineers from NASA, JPL, the Department of Energy, the U.S. Army, a major special effects studio, and various universities, the Sci-Fi Science crew explores force fields, lasers, lightning guns, rail guns, extrasolar planets and other "science fiction" concepts that are in fact, quite real. A campy, animation-rich alien invasion of Los Angeles provides the jumping-off point for real science demonstrations.
