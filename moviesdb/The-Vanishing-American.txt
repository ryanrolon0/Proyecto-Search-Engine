The Vanishing American

 Marion Warner inherits a piece of land in the New Mexico desert and arrives to determine her best course of action with the property. She is initially determined to have the Navaho Indians who are living on the land run off, but encounters stiff resistance from local high-roller Morgan and his toady Blucher. Marion meets Morgan's enemy, Blandy, a Navaho with an education and a sophisticated outlook. Blandy helps Marion see how the Indians have been exploited and pitted against one another by venal white traders like Morgan. Together they plot to overcome Morgan's plans.
