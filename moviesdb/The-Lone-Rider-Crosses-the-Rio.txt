The Lone Rider Crosses the Rio

 Hiding from outlaws in Mexico, Tom and Fuzzy help a Mexican offical's son by faking his kidnapping (the boy's father disapproves of his affair with a cabaret singer). When the kid is really kidnapped, our heroes get blamed. In the second film of this 17-film series (whis was followed by "The Lone Rider in Ghost Town" and not one of the 1943 films as somebody seems to think), Tom Cameron and "Fuzzy" Jones, running from a Texas sheriff's posse, on a frame-up charge, disguise themselves and cross the Rio Grande into Mexico. The Mexican Rurales arrest Tom as being the notorious bandit, El Puma, as charged by Jarvis, but the town mayor, Torres, an old friend of Tom's, laughs at the idea and has them released. Later, at a fiesta at Torres' hacienda, Tom learns that Torres is angry and objects to his son, Francisco, keeping company with cantina-dancer Rosalie, daughter of a peon, Pedro. Torres asks Tom and "Fuzzy" to 'kidnap' his son to keep him away from Rosalie, and they do and then Francisco is re-kidnapped for real by the real El Puma, and Tom and "Fuzzy" have a lot of explaining to do to clear their names, and only have about 30 more minutes of running time to get it done.
