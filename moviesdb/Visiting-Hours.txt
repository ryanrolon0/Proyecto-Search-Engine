Visiting Hours

 Based on a true story. A dying woman suffering from inoperable stomach cancer is given six weeks to live. Besides being in constant pain, she's also heartbroken that her adult son rarely comes to visit her in the hospital, but when he eventually does come to see her, they have an intense and emotional interaction at her bedside, where she begs her son to change his ways and seek redemption before it's too late.
