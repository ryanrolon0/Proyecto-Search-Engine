School for Danger

 Semi-documentary depicting how Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE) provided trained agents, arms and other assistance to the European resistance groups fighting against Hitler. The "stars" of the film are two actual British agents, Captain Harry REe DSO, OBE, Croix De Guerre, MEdaille de la REsistance, and Jacqueline Nearne, MBE. As agents "Felix" and "Cat", they recreate some of their adventures in France.
