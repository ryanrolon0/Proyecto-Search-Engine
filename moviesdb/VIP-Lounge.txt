VIP Lounge

 Small town actress Wanda is fulfilling a dream, to see the Berlin Film Festival (Berlinale) once. And maybe she catches the eye of some important movie mogul. So she leaves for Berlin to find out that the film festival is not the thing she expected. Masses of "would be's" are on the big hunt. She wants to leave but all of a sudden she is caught in a glossy nightmare.
