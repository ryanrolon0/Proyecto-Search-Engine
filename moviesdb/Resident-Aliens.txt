Resident Aliens

 A story of finding your way in an unfamiliar world, 'Resident Aliens' follows three American outcasts forced to resettle in the unforgiving Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, land of their birth. KK, China and Looney - all former gang members and ex-cons - are Cambodian refugees whose families survived a genocide that wiped out nearly a fifth of the country's population. They grew up in California but were deported - along with hundreds of others - after felony convictions. With few skills, little money and no family to fall back on, they face new obstacles and follow different paths towards reconciliation. While China and Looney erect walls to block out the pain, KK, through breakdancing, takes on the challenge of helping kids in even more desperate circumstances than him.
