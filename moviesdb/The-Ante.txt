The Ante

 When down-on-his-luck Sam Bailey takes a wrong turn on a remote country road, he ends up with more than a little dirt to wash off his shoes after a miserable farmwife's hope for a better life becomes his worst nightmare. After Sam's greedy Russian wife discovers his deadly secret, she ups the ante with her own crazy plot - playing with Sam's life to cover her bet. The story of a man's absurd gamble to save his innocence; three desperate people who bet everything they have in a brainless high-stakes game of loser-loses-all.
