The Smoke of the .45

 A cattle-rustler's daughter meets the ranger and falls in love with him. She confides her secret to her sister, who is in sympathy with her, and when her father demands that she marry his lieutenant, and places her under restraint to force the marriage, the little sister rides to the rangers and arranges an elopement. They are captured and the revengeful rustlers determine to shoot the rangers. His sweetheart throws herself before her lover and pleads for his life. While this is in progress, the little sister slips away and warns the rangers of their leader's plight. The crafty father tells the girl that if she will marry the man he has selected, they will permit her lover to go free. Refuse, and he will be shot instantly. To save his life, the girl makes a supreme sacrifice and agrees to marry the father's choice. The lover pleads to be shot rather than accept the sacrifice. In the meantime, the rangers ride to the rescue of their chief. Forcing the girl to make good her promise, the rustlers ride with her to the nearest ministry and hold the ranger until the marriage is consummated. The rangers then arrive and rescue their leader from the outlaws and in the fight that ensues, the "forty-five" of a ranger speeds the leaden messenger that frees the girl from a distasteful union and returns her to her lover's arms.
