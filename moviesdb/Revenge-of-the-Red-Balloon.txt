Revenge of the Red Balloon

 It's a gorgeous day in Paris; the cafes are full. A solitary man of middle age walks home, munching on a snack, baguette and fresh vegetables in hand. Suddenly, a strong cord loops around his neck from above, and he's strangled. It's the Red Balloon, back after more than 40 years to take revenge on the heartless lads who popped its ancestor. The balloon uses the phone book to track down one enemy, sending him tumbling down stairs. With invention, the balloon takes care of murderers three and four. Then, all that's left is to find Pascal, the lad who was the balloon's friend. Success is at hand, but will Pascal recognize his pal after all these years?
