Once word spreads that Rurik is loose, Michael and his companions set out to track him down and bring justice to his past. The path they travel is corrupt with evil, and Michael's justice turns to revenge, as he is led into a trap giving up the one thing Rurik has always wanted gave him 23 years ago.
