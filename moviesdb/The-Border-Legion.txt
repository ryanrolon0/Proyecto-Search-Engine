The Border Legion

 Wanted by the law in New York, Dr. Steve Kells heads west and arrives in an area controlled by an outlaw gang known as the Border Legion. When the gang's boss is wounded, they kidnap Kells and force him to remove the bullet. Not allowed to leave and being a wanted man, he joins the gang. Now wanted as a gang member also, he nevertheless plans a raid that will lead the entire gang into a trap. The story has a young physician, Steve Kells, taking the blame for a crime committed by the brother of the girl, Alice Randall, he loves, and he leaves New York as a fugitive from justice. Alice, not knowing the man he is shielding is her brother, goes West looking for him. Using the name of Kellogg, he meets and makes friends with "Honest John" Whittaker, a dealer in phony stock in Idaho. Alice, in her pursuit of Steve, is shot by a gang of outlaws known as "The Border Legion", and Steve extracts the bullet and nurses her back to health, thereby revealing himself as a skilled surgeon and winning the respect of the townspeople. Border Legion leader Joe Guilden is wounded in a hold-up and sends his chief henchman Santos to kidnap Steve. Steve convinces Guilden that he too is a wanted man, and Guilden takes him on as a gang member much to the displeasure (bordering on jilted jealousy) of Santos. (If this wasn't a B-western, the "relationship" between Guilden and Santos might be open for some between-the-lines interpretation.) Steve sets a trap for Guilden and his gang and, through Alice and "Honest John", warns the authorities.
