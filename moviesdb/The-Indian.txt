The Indian

 "The Indian" is a touching drama about a negligent father who must face the son he abandoned years earlier, and the emotional wreckage he caused, in order to obtain a life-saving transplant. The father hires a beautiful young mechanic to help restore an old Indian motorbike and uses her and the restoration process to manipulate his troubled teenage son's emotions. Complications arise when the father has difficulty maintaining the lie to both his son and himself.
