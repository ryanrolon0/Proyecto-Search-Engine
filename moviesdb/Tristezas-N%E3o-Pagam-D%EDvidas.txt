Tristezas Não Pagam Dívidas

 While grieving her husband in a cemetery, a widow meets a smart widower and tells him that she has inherited a large amount of money from her husband. The small time crook convinces her to go to a beauty shop and he moves to her apartment, going to parties, theaters, restaurants and casinos with her. The widow brings her son Carlinhos (Oscarito), who lives in a mental institution, to live with them.
