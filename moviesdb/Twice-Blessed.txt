Twice Blessed

 Stephanie and Terry are two identical twins who have been split up since their parents divorced seven years before. Each envies the life style of the other so they decide, without telling Jeff or Mary, to switch families for a day or two. They soon find that it is harder than just looking like someone to be able to do what that person is expected to do. When they find that their charade may bring their parents back together they agree to continue it. A major complication starts when Jeff's girlfriend, and co-worker, Alice finds out the real story.
