The Naked Cosmos

 "The Naked Cosmos" contains four episodes hosted by the enigmatic "Quintas," a TV prophet promoting his Cosmic Connections to the Collective Mindstream. He does so through "The Naked Cosmos," his weekly program. To help him along is an unlikely crew of regulars anxious announcer; Mistress Velda, the lovely cataloguer of celestial events; Ego, Master of Teleportation; The Chief, who wears a leopard mask and barks out orders in Spanish; and Zansky, the strange collector of bizarre films who hails from Dimension 9. But the show doesn't always go as planned. Despite his regular guests and allies, Quintas has a deep and troubling conflict with his own clone, the dark and mysterious Kalisto, whose philosophies are scientific and rational, in direct contrast to the intuitive Quintas. Tensions build, initially as a result of rivalry over the beautiful Mistress Velda. But soon no power can stop the Battle of the Century, as the two clones duke it out at Area 51, the infamous nexus of cosmic, alien power.
