They're Not Green

 For over 25 years the Wind Power Industry, the Wind Power Lobbyists, and U.S. Politicians have promoted Wind Power as 'Clean and Green'. The color of green looms large in this equation, but it is the color of money, not clean air. This documented feature takes you through the wind industry in California where it began, and the expansion of Wind Turbines through out the U.S. Wind Power is the most highly Federal Subsidized form of electrical energy and the least productive. Politicians abuse their power in rural communities for the benefit of International Conglomerates.
