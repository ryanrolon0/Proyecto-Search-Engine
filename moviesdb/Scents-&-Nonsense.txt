Scents & Nonsense

 The world is turned upside down when Chloris, a perfume maker, loses her sense of smell. Scents & Nonsense explores the nature and qualities of film as a medium, and its alternatives. A hybrid of silent film, Japanese Benshi narration, and modern day HD video, Scents & Nonsense calls attention to both the unreliable narrator as well as the form and function of current day media.
