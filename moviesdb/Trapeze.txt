Trapeze

 Mike Ribble was once a great trapeze artist - and the only to have completed a triple somersault - before his accident. Tino joins the circus, and manages to covince Mike to teach him the 'triple'. Meanwhile Lola, a tumbler, wants to get in on the act. Tino Orsini has learned the trapeze from his father but he travels to Europe to seek out Mike Ribble, one of the few men who has managed to complete a triple somersault. Ribble no longer works the trapeze and now walks with a cane after a nasty fall left him a cripple. Orsini convinces him to act as his catcher and all is well until the gold digging Lola, who'll do just about anything to become part of a major circus act, arrives on the scene. Her presence creates friction between the two men and puts in doubt whether Tino will ever accomplish the elusive triple. Mike Ribble was the sixth trapeze artist ever to complete an almost impossible triple somersault. Naturally gifted Tino Orsini wants to be the seventh, if he can only persuade a retired Ribble to teach him how and to be his catcher. Ribble retired from the high flying following his trapeze accident, which not only broke his body - he now walks with a limp and a cane - but more importantly his spirit. Orsini's enthusiasm eventually brings Ribble's spirit back to life. "Ribble & Orsini" become the talk of the circus as they work on the triple somersault. However, Lola, an acrobat in the same circus, will do whatever she needs to do to make sure the circus spotlight is solely on her.
