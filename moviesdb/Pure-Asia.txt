Pure Asia

 One day, a high school boy was being bullied by the mob, and a girl on her way home saw this and came to save him. The boy can't forget the girl who left without telling her name. A few days later, the boy sees the girl again, but is shocked that she wore a Chimachogori (Korean ethnic dress). A moment later, the girl is surrounded by college men, they start to make fun of her and cut her chimachogori. The scissors in the college man's hands gets pushed into the girl's chest and the girl dies. It was autumn of 2002, whilst the top news was about Japanese kidnap cases by North Koreans.
