Respect for Acting

 A frustrated acting teach (Dan Butler) uses all the tools at his disposal to spark passion in his inexperienced students. Employing scenes from classic films such as A Place in the Sun, Casablanca, Angels with Dirty Faces, and Sunset Boulevard, he coaxes, pushes, startles, bullies, and shames; ANYTHING to raise them to a level of work he knows they are capable of doing...not an easy task.
