The Green Monster

 An alien creature invades a pristine environment. A green goop gobbles up a city's crown jewel. An unsuspecting populace braces for the inevitable. Sounds like a scenario for a horror movie. But it's also something straight out of one of America's mightiest rivers. In summer '05, a massive algae bloom, spiked with a dangerous toxin, covered Florida's St. Johns River for 100 miles. It was ugly. It was stinky. It threatened fish, plants and people. It was also unprecedented. No one had ever seen anything like it before. Whodunit? Why should anyone care? And what happens if we do nothing? The Green Monster -- It Came From The River. Watch it. Then wish it was "only a movie."
