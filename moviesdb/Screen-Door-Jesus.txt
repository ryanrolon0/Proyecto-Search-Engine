Screen Door Jesus

 An eclectic cast of characters intertwines and collides around themes of faith, religion and race in a small East Texas town. Screen Door Jesus tells the story of the church-going, but not exactly God-fearing, town's folk who wake up one morning to discover the image of Jesus on Old Mother Harper's screen door. With media and crowds gathering around the phenomenon, and Jesus staring everyone straight in the face, it's time for people to take sides.
