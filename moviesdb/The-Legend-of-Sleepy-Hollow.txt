The Legend of Sleepy Hollow

 Ichabod Crane, a Yankee wanderer, arrives in Sleepy Hollow and becomes the new schoolmaster. He is attracted to Katrina Van Tassel and blissfully fantasizes about how she and her money can be his. Her suitor Brom Bones, the blacksmith, wants to scare him away and dresses up as the legendary Headless Horseman. During the prank, the real ghost appears and drives Ichabod off.
