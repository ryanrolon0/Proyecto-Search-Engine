Prey to God

 Five teenage friends head out for the time of their lives on a camping trip in the middle of nowhere. However, their fun filled trip turns to one of terror when one from their group disappears and they stumble upon a house deep in the woods and a family with a dark and horrible secret. The friends must fright for their lives before they fall prey to the twisted family who has a desire to purify the sinners and an even darker desire for human flesh.
