The Nude Bomb

 An unknown terrorist has developed a new type of bomb that will destroy clothing, but leave people unharmed. Agent Maxwell Smart (this time without Chief, 99, or Hymie) is taken out of retirement and sent back into the field to track down who this madman is and put a stop to his plans.
