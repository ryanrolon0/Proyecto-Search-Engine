Tom

 An impossible love triangle - the relationships between Tom, Daniel and Michal are about to stand the test when the three go on a weekend of camping. Like a tower of cards, the surface is shaky, and might collapse with the lightest breeze. Tom wants Daniel to love him the way he loves Michal, who wants Daniel to treat her the way he treats Tom. As oppose to them, Daniel just wants to be left alone. Each of them with his or her reasons tries to find refuge in the indifferent countryside. How long can they keep appearances?
