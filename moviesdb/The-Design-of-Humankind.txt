The Design of Humankind

 Genesis is hatched in an executive board room rather than the cosmos, and life as we know it begins. The Design of Humankind is a comedy that takes us back to the drawing board to question the original purpose of dividing the human species into two sexes. Rather than social stereotypes, it places the emphasis on how similar the two counterparts actually are to poke fun at their inherent genetic differences. Is this complex dependency between men and women really as natural as we once believed, or the product of some higher being's attempt at eternal entertainment?
