Spanish Bull Fight

 A wonderfully spectacular scene giving the complete detail of a bull fight in Madrid, Spain, from start to finish. The bulls are very fierce and full of fight, and the picture abounds in thrilling incidents, including the killing of a horse and the final death of the bull itself. The picture was taken with a very broad angle lens, and practically the whole amphitheatre is included in the field. This is not an arranged picture for photographic purposes, but a genuine bull fight given in the presence of the Royal Family of Spain, with immense crowds of spectators attending.
