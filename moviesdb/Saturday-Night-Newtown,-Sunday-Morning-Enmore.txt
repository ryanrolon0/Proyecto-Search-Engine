Saturday Night Newtown, Sunday Morning Enmore

 Claire wakes up on Sunday morning - in Enmore - next to Matthew, who is definitely 'not her type'. Her memories of the night before are hazy, to say the least. She tries to leave quickly but Matthew is surprisingly imaginative - and appealing. By the time she leaves, she wants to stay. A story of romantic possibilities.
