The Magnificent Molly McBride

 Molly, played by Julia Kennedy(Sundance award-winning film, Grown Up Movie Star), is brutalized by her peers at Irish dance school for well, dancing badly. However, she finds an unlikely mentor in a cat burglar, The Fearless Fergal Chase (Andy Jones, Rare Birds). Turns out, Fergal was a star Irish Dancer in his heyday before he turned to crime. And like all smart 11-year-olds, she blackmails him to train her for the upcoming Newfoundland Irish Dance Championships.
