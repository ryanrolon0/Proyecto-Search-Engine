Shooting the Chutes

 A stationary camera holds a middle-distance shot of the chutes at Luna Park, Coney Island. In the background, the chute rises and we see boats, one at a time, shoot down, gathering speed before hitting the water in the foreground and bounding past our vantage, splashing. In mid shot, across the frame, is the promenade where a crowd walks or stops to watch the adventurers descend. After five boatloads go past, a solitary bicycle rider shoots the chute. Jump cuts move the action along. On the right-hand side, carriages bring more adventurers up the chute slowly.
