Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party

 "Hi everybody and welcome to the Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!" Says Shrek upon the beginning of the party. If you own the Shrek 2-Disk Special Edition DVD or Special Edition VHS, you can view this extended ending to the movie 'Shrek'. What happens is after Shrek and Fiona's wedding, Shrek turns up the karaoke machine and your favorite characters like Donkey and the Gingerbread Man sing hits like 'Baby Got Back' and 'Like a Virgin', the party continues as many more start singing songs as well. The party then ends with the entire cast singing the lively 'Dance to the Music'.
