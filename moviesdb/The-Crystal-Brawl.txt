The Crystal Brawl

 Bluto muscles out Popeye to take Olive to the fair. Popeye rushes ahead and poses as a fortune teller, luring Olive in. He shows Olive her future (actually, her past) in the crystal ball climbing sequence that culminates in Bluto assaulting Olive. Then, a clip from another amusement park showing strongman Bluto stealing Olive away to a roller-coaster while Popeye rings a strength-testing bell repeatedly. Olive, having seen this, no longer wants anything to do with Bluto and walks out. Bluto exposes Popeye and chases Olive into a Tunnel of Love; Popeye follows and trashes Bluto.
