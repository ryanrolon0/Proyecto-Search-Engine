Shakespeare Unplugged

 A series of interactive educational videos studying the works of popular playwright William Shakespeare. Made by actors, for actors, the Shakespeare Unplugged series offers a unique and direct look into not only the speeches themselves, but also the meaning behind the words. Such a tool could be utilized for actors learning a new Shakespeare role, students studying the playwright, or any Shakespeare enthusiast interested in the language of the period. Each selection offers two videos - an informational in-depth interview and a combined performance of the speech itself, performed by five trained and experienced film and theater actors.
