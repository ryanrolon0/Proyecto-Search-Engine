The Gospel of Luke Matthews

 The Gospel of Luke Matthews is an absurd take on what humans have become. We are social creatures that have reached an evolutionary plateau. The only way that we can change in our environment is if we create a tool that allows us to be better suited for a particular setting. This film satirizes human communication and interaction by proposing the idea that even in the face of incredible change we remain a fixed, socially designed species incapable of true adaptation. We are stubborn creatures that will stick with what we "know" even when there is proof otherwise.
