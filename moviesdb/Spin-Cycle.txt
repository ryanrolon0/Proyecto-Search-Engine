Spin Cycle

 Spin Cycle is a meditation on the circle and the act of spinning; from the atomic to the cosmic. From the conceptual to the physical. Rotation and formation, pattern and cadence, beginning and return. History, metaphor and donuts. I also wanted to tell the largest story possible in the shortest amount of time.
