Un bisou pour le monde

 Wednesday, June 29, 2005. It's a school morning in Strasbourg. Madam's students, who look to be about 11 or 12, are of all races. LEo of Alsace is in trouble from the first minute when he's caught whispering to his seatmate, Nina of Antilles. Madam has brought copies of newspapers, divides the class into groups of three, and tells them to read and discuss. LEo, Nina, and Wei Fang get "Le Monde," which LEo's father has told him is for rich people. He tears the pages. Madam's punishment includes his taping the paper exactly as it was. LEo practices his own style of journalism, which gets him into further trouble until Nina and Wei Fang speak up. Magic takes over.
