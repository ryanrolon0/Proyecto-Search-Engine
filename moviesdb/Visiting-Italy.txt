Visiting Italy

 This travelogue begins in Rome, travels the road to Assisi, then goes on to Pisa, and ends in Florence. In Rome the focus is history and architecture. On the road to Assisi, we see the white cattle of Tuscany and the area's traditional farming. In the city of St. Francis, there's both history and shopping. On the way to Pisa, we observe the many trees planted in vineyards as poles for vines. In Pisa, we visit the Leaning Tower. In Florence, from the Cathedral to the Ponte Vecchio, the attention is on art and sculpture and the enduring inspiration of the wonders of this city.
