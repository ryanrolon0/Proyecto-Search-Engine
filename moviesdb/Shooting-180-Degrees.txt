Shooting 180 Degrees

 Striker, a confused man ,feeling a bit down and out from the crazy ride they call life ,decides to contract for a murder and win big in the end. Instead, he ends up losing a little more than he had risked. Will he have the strength, both mental and physical, to make it out with a peace of mind? Or will he spiral into the depths of a mental hell and let his alter ego captivate his mind forever? Shooting 180 Degrees reminds us of those times where we understand the mind truly has the power to rule over matter.
