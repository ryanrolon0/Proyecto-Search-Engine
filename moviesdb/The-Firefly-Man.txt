The Firefly Man

 An old man in a solitary cabin is surrounded by mechanical displays he's built in his garden. He goes to sleep on a stormy night with a jar of fireflies beside his bed. His sleep is interrupted by a dream of a day in his childhood when a bear attacked his family. The fireflies seem to bring back the dead, and by the next morning, the sky clear, the old man finds peace.
