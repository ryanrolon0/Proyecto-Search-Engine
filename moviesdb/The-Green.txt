The Green

 When young lads Philip and Stephen's football field is turned into a building site they have nowhere to play, until one day they discover a new field. Unfortunately for them, peppy pensioners Bernard and Cecil are quite fond of bowling here, and don't take kindly to their arrival. Neither pair wants to back down and a war like no other breaks out for the right to play on 'The Green.'
