 Ofek is a young writer who claims every detail in his life has a meaning. His world gradually cracks when he and his girlfriend Lora start getting a transcript of their conversations in the mail, during the same week when they're packing their things and getting ready for moving to a new apartment. Ofek tries dealing with this phenomena in different ways, while Lora suspects their good friend Guy. During this one week Ofek systematically ruins his relationships with himself, his art, his girlfriend, his best friend and his sense of reality.
