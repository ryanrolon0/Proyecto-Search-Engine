The Football Fan

 Another of the series of Paramount Pacemakers that featured Tom Ewell. This time Tom is trying to listen to a radio broadcast of a football game featuring a team he has made a $10 bet on. The radio fizzles out on every climatic play, leaving Ewell in the dark about how his team is faring. At the end of the game, the announcer gives the scores on all of the games except the one Tom has the wager on.
