Rolling Home

 Old time rodeo performer Raymond Hatton and his grandson, (Buzz Henry as Robert Dee 'Buzzy" Henry) arrive in a small town with an injured horse, and local minister Russell Hayden tends the horse's injured leg. Jean Parker, a wealthy but selfish young widow, lives in the town. The church is in debt but the minister's financial problems are eventually solved by the horse winning a surrey race, and the widow whose attitude has been softned by Hatton, Henry and Hayden. This was the first film Harry Carey Jr appeared in as an adult, and was brought about when the just-discharged-from-the-Navy Carey ran into producer William Berke on an Hollywood street corner. Berke, who had produced six sound westerns in the mid-30's starring the elder Carey, offered Carey Jr. a bit in this film. The first film Harry Carey Jr appeared in was in 1921, as an infant in one of his father's silent westerns. Even with a 25-year-gap between his "first" and second film, Carey's 80 years of work in films may be the longevity record.
