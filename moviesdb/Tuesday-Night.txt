Tuesday Night

 The film's premise starts at the feeling you have when you leave the theater, after watching on-screen romance, and ends with the feeling you have by the time you get home. Shot in NYC during December 2001, it presents two characters in need for some romantic comedy in their life. Can life be the "Love Boat" or is real life more like the "Titanic"?
