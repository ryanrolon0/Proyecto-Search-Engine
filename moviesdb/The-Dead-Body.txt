The Dead Body

 Gavin is suffering from a horrible headache and cannot remember anything from the day before. He soon finds a dead body and a bag filled with money in his car, however, he has no idea of how they got there. He thinks that he committed murder and robbed a bank, even though he is certain that he did not. He cannot go to the police because he would be unable to prove his innocence, so instead, he turns to his friends for help. As he starts to put the pieces from the day before back together, he learns that he cannot trust everybody and that there is more to his situation then what he previously thought.
