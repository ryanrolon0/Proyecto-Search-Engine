The Phantom Dogsled

 A Native girl in Fort Yukon, Alaska in 1923 is accidentally shot during the winter. The weather is so bad that a doctor cannot be flown so her fiance takes a dogsled team into the storm to get a doctor and bring him back. The finance disappears and is only seen again, occasionally, with his dog sled team as THE PHANTOM DOGSLED.
