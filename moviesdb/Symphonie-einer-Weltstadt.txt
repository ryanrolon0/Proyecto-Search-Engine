Symphonie einer Weltstadt

 This film seeks to pass itself off as a positive and definitive history of the city of Berlin before the outbreak of World War Two. It is heavily influenced by the bent of the National Socialist party/Nazi Party ideology and seeks to idealize the city in such a way that is in furtherance of the party's view of itself, and it inconsistent, in many aspects, with the real history of the city.
