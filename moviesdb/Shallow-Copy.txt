Shallow Copy

 Max knew his life-long friend Will was much more than just another computer geek. Most high-school seniors aren't doing doctorate-level software research. So when Will shows Max his latest project, a new program that's a stone's throw from being artificially intelligent, Max isn't all that surprised. But when Will informs him that he purposefully limited the program from becoming self-aware, Max knows that all it will take is a nudge for the two of them to make history. In the end, neither of them is prepared for the ramifications when the project spins out of control, putting a life in jeopardy and testing their maturity, their friendship, and their very identity.
