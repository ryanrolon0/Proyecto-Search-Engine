Spanish Fiesta

 A narrator introduces us to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, founded by Peter the Great in the 18th century. In full costume on a colorful set, villagers wait in old Spain for the golden hour of fiesta. A lovely Gypsy tells a young man's fortune; to celebrate, he leads a jota. That evening, the aristocrats dance in garden as fun-loving peasants look on. Steamy romance is in the air. The peasants enjoy a blindfold dance; the tempo then speeds up. At the Gypsy camp, a flame burns in the fortune-teller's heart. She and her jealous suitor, with the company,perform traditional Gypsy dances. Dancers in animal costumes look on and celebrate.
