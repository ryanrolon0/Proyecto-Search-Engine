The Salted Mine

 Richard Preston, possessing a little capital, decides to go west and invest it in a gold mine. Here he falls into the hands of two soldiers of fortune. They salt a worthless piece of land with fine grain gold and succeed in selling it to Preston. After an hour's work though, Preston realizes the scheme and finds that he has lost every dollar he had. Sally, a waif of the mining camp, who, some days previous, had been insulted by these two miners, has witnessed the whole operation. She appears and puts Preston wise to the fraud and urges Preston to go after the swindlers. Preston mounts a horse and rides to the shack of the miners just in time to see them go away. When Preston demands the return of his money, one of the pair strikes him with the butt of a heavy revolver and then binds him. Sally, aiding Preston, unbinds him, and together they follow the trail left by the miners. They overtake them among the foot hills and a fierce battle is waged. Of course, Preston and Sally are victorious, and secure the return of the money.
