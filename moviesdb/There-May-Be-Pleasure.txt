There May Be Pleasure

 There May Be Pleasure is the story of two college students, Nathan and Keren. The two are working on a film project together, only he's more interested in her than his grade. The story unfolds as Nathan is filming a scene for the project. In each progressive shot, we follow Nathan's internal dialog as it reveals how he feels about Keren. Perhaps letting on more, than he would like.
