The Wicked One

 A small group of teenagers who soon discover what was once called an "urban myth" is about to become a frightening reality. When a former mythology professor reveals the truth behind the story of "Appladus" and his minions from hell, the teens begin to experience an eerie chain of events, which lead them to believe that somehow a porthole for the hell spawn and his demon army was opened. The professor warns them that once Appladus' soul has found the right vessel to reincarnate his physical form, he will raise hell on earth once again and destroy all human existence by unleashing millions of evil, tormented and malicious dead upon the living. With time running out, "Jackson" and his friends must find a way to stop Appladus from locating a vessel and thwart the demon's plan to allow hell's army to roam the  earth once again.
