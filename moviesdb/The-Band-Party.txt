The Band Party

 'Band Party' as they are known in Kolkata, dress up in bright uniforms and use mainly wind instruments, drums and percussion. They are available on hire as accompaniment to any festive occasion, be it a wedding procession or a religious festival and brighten up the ceremonies. The trade is gradually disappearing as less and less people opt for such accompaniments.
