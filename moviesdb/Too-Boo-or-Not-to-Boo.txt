Too Boo or Not to Boo

 Mild-and-meek Casper, the Friendly Ghost, is depressed and glum because people will have nothing to do with him despite the fact that he has read "How To Win Friends, and Influence People" from cover-to-cover. This is especially true on his favorite holiday, Hallowe'en, but as soon as all the children and grown-ups realize he is a real ghost, they run away. But he perks up when he meets a cute girl ghost at a barn dance.
