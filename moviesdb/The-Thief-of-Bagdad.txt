The Thief of Bagdad

 Oil, flying horses, and tales of liberation come together in this Technicolor action-adventure-fantasy, starring a swaggering Texan empire-builder in Baghdad and his nemesis. The film uses imagery and dialog from classic Orientalist cinema to depict a clash of civilizations, Hollywood-style.
