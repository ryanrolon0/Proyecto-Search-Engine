The Elopement on Double L Ranch

 The Widow Walker and her daughter Molly become neighbors of the ranchmen and one day while Molly is riding her saddle girth becomes loose and calls the foreman, who is passing, to assist her. Reluctantly he comes forward to help her and she speedily overcomes his objections to the society of ladies. In the meantime her mother has started out to make a friendly call at the 'Double L Ranch' and, finding Jim Farrow at home and alone, matters progress rapidly for them also. Both men become enamored of mother and daughter, respectively, and in order to conceal their intentions from each other plan an elopement with the lady of their choice. The elopements are planned for the same day and they meet in the office of Justice Smith simultaneously. Of course explanations are in order and both men become benedicts regardless of their vow.
