The Cult

 "The Cult"centers a family in which the daughter has vanished. She should be enrolled in first year English, but vanished a month after classes began. As parents go, Nathan and Evelyn have been lousy ever since their marriage went south and right now, they're too self-obsessed to notice just how far off course their daughter has flown. Late one night while watching TV, Nathan notices their estranged daughter in an infomercial. Meet Rachel. Something's wrong - it's quickly determined that she's in a cult. In fact, she's the centre of it. The party ends for Nathan and Evelyn. It's their daughter. In order to get her back, Nathan goes underground and enters the cult. Evelyn remains on the outside as the only one who knows where Nathan and Rachel are.
