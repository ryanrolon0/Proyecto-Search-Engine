Punch and Booty

 Roller Derby is the fastest- growing women's sport in the UK. 'Punch & Booty' investigates the development of Roller Derby in Britain through interviews with some of the sport's leading players, directors and loyal fans. As well as examining the origins of Roller Derby and its evolution through the 20th century, we also answer the question 'What does the future hold for this fledgling sport?' We hope this film will soon be seen as the definitive document charting the birth, and subsequent growth, of one of this century's most exiting social movements.
