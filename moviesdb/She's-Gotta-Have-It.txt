She's Gotta Have It

 The story of Nola Darling's simultaneous sexual relationships with three different men is told by her and by her partners and other friends. All three men wanted her to commit solely to them; Nola resists being "owned" by a single partner. A window into the life and loves of a young black woman in Brooklyn. Nola Darling is dating three very different men simultaneously -- a controlling, protective, patriarchal type; Greer Childs -- a wealthy, vain, arrogant male model; and Mars Blackmon -- a comical, juvenile, immature jokester. Nola has gone beyond even a love "triangle" and the stability of this love "square" is threatened by the increasing jealousy among her three suitors. Finally, under pressure, Nola makes her "choice," but in the end, is this what she really wants?
