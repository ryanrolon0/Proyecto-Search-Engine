Vol van gratie

 Two innocent and unsuspecting nuns, one tall and one short, stop at a shop that sells sex toys. Thinking they're buying candles, they buy rubber phalli, return to the convent, and set them alight. The noxious smoke drives them back to the shop for something that will smell more pleasant. The shopkeeper obliges, and this time, not only do the tall and short nun have their spirits raised, so do all their sisters. Ecstasy pervades the highest vaults of the convent ceiling.
