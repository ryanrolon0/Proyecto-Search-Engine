Suzanne

 Suzanne, more than anything, is terrified of the dark, which is why Sarah has to walk her home from her night class every Tuesday at 10PM. But tonight, Sarah has accidentally missed the meeting, and Suzanne is nowhere to be found. In her desperate search to find her, Sarah discovers that there may be some truth to Suzanne's paranoid delusions.
