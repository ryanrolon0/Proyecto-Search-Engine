Slappily Married

 Jos is a dim-witted husband who is superstitious about Friday the 13th, so he stays at home rather than going to work and encountering any bad luck. At home, where he is safe from bad luck, he destroys the kitchen, innocently gets caught with another woman, his wife leaves him, and he's caught trying to sneak into a woman's hotel to get his wife to return home.
