Rehabilitating Justice

 Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Joe Hynes and NYC Judge Charles Posner have successfully initiated a flagship court system of rehabilitation via "Prouect Legalize," throughout the Brooklyn system of justice, and they've also instituted the program as a learning tool in more, than 300 Brooklyn schools - public, private, yeshivas, and parochial schools.
