Praise Marx and Pass the Ammunition

 Dom, a member of a small trotskyist group, lives in a flat overlooking the British Museum in London. He goes to meetings and sleeps with as many attractive women as possible. The May '68 uprising in Paris forces him to reassess his political position towards workers' struggles in Britain and causes a split in the group.
