Tak for Alt

 The documentary TAK FOR ALT- Survival of a Human Spirit tells the remarkable story of educator Judy Meisel, a Holocaust survivor whose experiences during and after World War II inspired a life-long campaign against bigotry, intolerance and racism. The film follows her back to Eastern Europe and retraces her steps through the Kovno ghetto, the Stutthof Concentration Camp, and her liberation and recuperation in Denmark. Ultimately Judy's path led to the United States, where, after witnessing race riots in 1963, she discovered that only unflinching vigilance against racism could safeguard the liberty of all peoples. She began to champion the cause of tolerance at schools across the country, a campaign which she carries on to this day.
