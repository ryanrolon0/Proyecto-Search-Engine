Quiet Please!

 The family dog warns Tom not to make any noise so he can take a nap. Jerry hears this and immediately devises plans to ensure that the dog's nap will be interrupted (breaking plates, playing musical instruments, etc.). One of the few cartoons in the Tom and Jerry series in which one of the main characters speaks.
