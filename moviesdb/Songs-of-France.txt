Songs of France

 One of the "Famous Melody Series," with sound-on-disc, produced by James A. Fitzpatrick and distributed by Pathe Film Exchanges Inc. (and not by Educational). This one finds the usual star, Peggy Shaw, as the dancing-partner wife of an Apache dancer in an underworld dive in Paris. She is loved by a crippled violin player, whose death is caused by her husband who has thrown him down in a sub-cellar. Shaw is at his side when he dies, while her husband dances with another partner on the floor above them. Running through the films is a song played by the violinist.
