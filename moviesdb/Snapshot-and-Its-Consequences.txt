Snapshot and Its Consequences

 A hayseed and his pretty wife engage a photographer to take their pictures by a running brook in the country. The artist poses them and then calls the hayseed to look through the camera. While our country friend is trying to see the scenery through the lens, the photographer hangs his hat on the front of the camera and kisses the pretty blushing wife until the Rube peeps out and catches him, when he attacks the picture man, throws him to the ground and smashes the camera on his head. A Chinese man comes along, and although innocent, he is also thrown to the ground and severely handled. Full of life and action.
