They spend an innocent night in New York becoming more and more attracted to each other, so that when Catherine announces she intends to leave her husband and return to Paris Howard asks to go along too. In the cold light of morning problems and pressures from spouses crowd in. Howard is the husband of an unfeeling wife, Phyllis. Catherine is the wife of an equally uncaring husband, Howard's boss Ted. At a house party hosted by Ted, Ted urges Howard to pick up an available woman at the party and proceeds to show him how. Howard reluctantly tries it on Catherine who instantly accepts. The two find their marriages are loveless and decide to run away together.
