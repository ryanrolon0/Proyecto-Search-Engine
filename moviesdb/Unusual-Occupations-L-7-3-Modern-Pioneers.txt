Unusual Occupations L-7-3 Modern Pioneers

 This entry of "Unusual Occupations" takes a look at Pasadena's Tournamnet of Roses by going behind the scenes and showing the people, at work, who design the floats for the New Year's Day Parade that kicks off the annual Rose Bowl football game. Another man makes authentic miniature reproductions of zebras, elephants and clowns. A third hobbyist has designed a village duplicating California's gold-rush days. Then it's off to San Fernando Valley to watch Roy Rogers and his daughter, Cheryl, put "Trigger" through his tricks and training, while Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers sing a song.
