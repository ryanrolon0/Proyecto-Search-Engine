Rockin' Romeo & Juliet

 The story opens with the band OGGI on tour in the van, somewhere in America. Falling asleep at a roadside diner, the band's bassist dreams the band members into Shakespeare's story, where they become Romeo's sidekicks in the Montague family. Juliet's family is played by Asian actors, highlighting the feud between the two families. Original music written by David McGaw and Ginger Wade and performed by the band OGGI.
