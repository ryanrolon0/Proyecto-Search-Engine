The Framed Cat

 Tom filches a drumstick from a fresh-baked chicken. When Mammy is about to discover him, he hands it off to Jerry; this lets him be a hero to Mammy and still get his chicken. Jerry is miffed, and sees his chance to retaliate bone and planting it on Tom. Finally, Jerry bores a hole in the bone, inserts a bolt, and gets Tom to swallow a magnet. The bone keeps coming back to Tom, even through a fence. Finally, as Tom runs off followed by Spike, Jerry, who's been hiding in a tin can, is also dragged along.
