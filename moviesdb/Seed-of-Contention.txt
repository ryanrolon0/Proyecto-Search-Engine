Seed of Contention

 Inspired by a true story, "Seed of Contention" traces the lives of Dean, an American G.I., and Mila, his Spanish wife, in the midst of World War II Manila. After Dean is captured in the Bataan Death March and sent to prison camp, he is feared dead, and Mila is compelled to ensure hers and her family's survival. Later, Dean manages to flee camp only to find his family under house arrest. Since the presence of an American escapee compromises their safety, Mila has no choice but to sequester Dean in the basement where they can be together only in the dead of night. Ultimately, an unexpected event forces Mila to make a decision that challenges the integrity of the couple and deals lasting repercussions on everyone's lives.
