The Night We Dropped a Clanger

 A WWII British secret agent has a desperate mission in occupied France. An airman who is his double is enlisted in the scheme with the intention of confusing the enemy, but everyone gets confused. When German rockets start to land on England the Prime Minister insists there is only one man for the job - Wing Commander Blenkinsop. A daring masterplan is hatched to send a double of the Wing Commander to Egypt while he secretly flies to France. The fate of the project, indeed of Britain, depends on the double - Aircraftsman Arthur Atwood, presently on latrine duties somewhere in England.
