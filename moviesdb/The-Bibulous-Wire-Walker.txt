The Bibulous Wire Walker

 Two old sports after a night at the Club, return home, and sneaking through the backyard when they are caught by the neck of the clothes-line. One evidently imagines himself a wire walker, for he immediately climbs upon the clothes-line and proceeds to walk it in grand style while being steadied by his chum. Suddenly, however, the chum on the ground relaxes his hold and the old sport falls in a heap, breaking the line and spoiling the wash.
