The Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky

 The unorthodox cosmological theories of Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, in conversation with author Eric Larrabee. Velikovsky, who had by this time (1964) already become an enfant terrible in the academic world -- despite his advanced age and international reputation -- maintained that many things relegated to the distant past and the product of slow evolution had in fact occurred in historical times. Perhaps his most famous work was "Worlds in Collision", which reexamined the stories of the Bible and the folklores of many cultures, and coordinated them with catastrophic events in the solar system. His work also re-calibrates ancient Egyptian and Greek history. This interview is a very rare television appearance.
