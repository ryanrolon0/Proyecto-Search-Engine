Tuck Davis

 The story of a young hitman making his way through a world that, on the surface, appears to be middle-class and filled with attractive, everyday people, but underneath reeks of desperation, manipulation, and malevolence. His love life and the mystery of his work never intersect; until he meets Pearl, a beautiful cosmetics company owner, played by Christina Calph. Little does Tuck know that Pearl keeps a secret of her own. Clarry, the neighborhood boss played by Dante Nero comes to find out about a local woman running a competing business out of her apartment, he calls upon Tuck to rectify the situation.
