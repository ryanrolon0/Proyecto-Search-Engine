Thanthonni

 Kochu Ouseph's (Vijayaraghavan) three sons - Captain Raju, Ramu and Vijayaraghavan (in a second role) - do not like the vagabond playwright Daveed (Saikumar) who has impregnated their only sister, Katrina (Ambika). They hire a hit-man, Neelakantan, to kill Daveed. The child of Daveed and Katrina, Kochu Kunju, grows up to be a young man who is outspoken about his attitude towards his uncles and cousins. Kochu Ouseph's vast wealth can be divided among his many heirs only with the consent of all of them including Kochu Kunju - a fact that he uses to annoy them and later seek answers from them about the events of the past.
