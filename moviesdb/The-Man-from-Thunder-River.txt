The Man from Thunder River

 Henry Stevens knows that Ferguson's abandoned mine is valuable and when Jack Ferguson plans to reopen it he has him framed for murder. Bill and Gabby save him from the lynch mob and then investigate his mine. They accidentally find the secret door that connects it to Steven's mine. But Stevens' men capture them and set a charge that will explode and bury the two intruders.
