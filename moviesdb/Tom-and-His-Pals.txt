Tom and His Pals

 Tom Duffy, whose father is the half-owner of the Flying-U Ranch, spends half his time reading movie magazines and the other half with Mary Smith. Mary and her kid-brother, Frankie, are heirs to the other half of the Flying U, and wards of Tom's Father. Tom's interest in movie magazines is Pandora Golden, the movie vamp. Tom is thrilled when he learns that Pandora's next film will be shot on the ranch. Pandora's co-star, Courtney, learns of Mary's inheritance, and he conspires with Pandora to lure Tom away while he talks Mary into eloping. The latter, seeing Tom in Pandora's arms, gets angry and tells Courtney she will elope with him. Meanwhile, a child actress with the movie company, is rescued from a raging bull by Tom, and Tom learns that Pandora is the child's mother. She tells him of the scheme to make Mary marry Courtney, and Tom hits the saddle and takes out after Courtney the Cad.
