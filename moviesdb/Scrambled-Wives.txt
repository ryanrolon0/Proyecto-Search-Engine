Scrambled Wives

 A school girl elopes with a young man, but her father has the marriage annulled and takes the girl off to Europe to forget the boy. A couple of years later, the girl and the man she now hopes to marry encounter her briefly-wedded ex-husband and his new wife at a society party, and difficulties arise.
