Skating with the Stars

 Will pair celebrities with a world class ice skater as they prepare to compete in front of a live audience in a televised ice skating competition. The skating pairs will be critiqued by a panel of expert judges and will receive a set of scores based on artistry and technique, and also by viewers at home, with one couple being eliminated each week.
