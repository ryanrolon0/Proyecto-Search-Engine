Sand Mountain

 On a solo journey to through the American south to meet reclusive musician Cast King, photographer Kathryn McCool attempts to find the America she had, as a youth, re-created and photographed in her own backyard in rural New Zealand. Comparing what she finds with what was for so long imagined, Sand Mountain is an essay about a strange homecoming of sorts.
