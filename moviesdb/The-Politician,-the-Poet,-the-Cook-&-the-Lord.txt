The Politician, the Poet, the Cook & the Lord

 No one really ever notices them. They're just part of the scenery, but if you see what looks like a green garden shed, the size of a public toilet, in the middle of a London road, you've spotted a Cabbies Shelter. Slowly we enter a world of 'bread-pudding' and 'Toad 'n the hole', we hear Shakespeare being cited and smell cabbage and fried greasy potato-chips. A film of 15 minutes, about the life inside a green hut.
