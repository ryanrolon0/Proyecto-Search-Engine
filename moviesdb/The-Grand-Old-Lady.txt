The Grand Old Lady

 The Westmont Theatre has been a local icon in a quiet suburban New Jersey town for over 80 years. Called, "The Grand Old Lady" the theater building,long closed and decaying, is now at the center of talks of redevelopment and possible demolition. This is the last chance for her to tell her story before she dies. Few are aware of the theater's impact on the life and career of Steven Spielberg and Michael Landon, or how she effected and played a part in history of other major films including The Exorcist and Kramer v. Kramer. A boarded up time capsule, a relic of a day of bygone old vaudeville-movie theater palaces, her story is captured by a curious filmmaker, Brent J. Donaway, who grew up in the shadow of the theater, but was too young to have set foot in the inside when films were last shown there two decades ago. Donaway has a tour guide, a older seasoned veteran of working inside this and other local theaters. They track down projectionists, ushers, ticket sellers, moviegoers from the theater and place them back in their locations to tell their stories. They tell stories of a part of the movie industry seldom examined; some are funny, some sad, some shocking, but all nostalgic and interesting. In doing so, Donaway has not only captured the story of one old-time theater; he has captured a microcosm that paints a picture of old movie houses everywhere, almost all of which are now gone. It is a story with universal appeal.
