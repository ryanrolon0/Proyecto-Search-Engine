Tweaker with an Axe

 A film student's attempts to complete his graduate thesis project are stymied by his crew of inept friends who are more concerned with getting drunk, in-fighting and their romantic entanglements than they are with his film. Things go from bad to worse after a few terrifying encounters with the drug-addled, axe-wielding next-door neighbor, and one by one the group is dispatched by the maniac.
