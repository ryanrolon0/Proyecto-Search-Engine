The Story Behind

 Reunion's aren't always so sweet. The seedy streets of NYC's East Village provide the backdrop for, 'The Story Behind'. Sage(Johnny Dinan), a semi prominent street artist, finds himself lost in the lowest point of his life. He is forced into the hands of his older brother, Noir(Daniel Hall), who left Sage six yrs before...choosing to abandon his family and his art for a life on the streets. The story unfolds as Noir reluctantly takes his brother under his wing and into his abandoned warehouse squat. Panic, trust and the struggle to survive pin the brothers at opposing ends of the surreal landscape of NYC's gritty streets. What really is behind every piece of art? There is a story behind them all.
