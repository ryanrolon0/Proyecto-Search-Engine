The Curse of the Living Corpse

 Rufus Sinclair was a cranky old millionaire with a terrible fear of being buried alive. After his apparent death, clauses in his will meant to prevent his being buried alive are violated by his uncaring family, and soon a masked figure begins prowling the family's Connecticut estate, slaughtering the family members one by one in a variety of separate, horrible ways. Rufus Sinclair dies leaving a will vowing to return from the grave and wreak terrible vengeance on his family if certain conditions surrounding his death and burial are not observed; for his long-suffering wife Abigail, he predicts death by fire; eldest son Bruce is promised a violent death by disfiguration; the next son, Philip is informed he will die by suffocation; and Philip's wife Vivian will drown. Several days after the reading of the will by family attorney James Benson, the body of Rufus vanishes from its crypt, and the chain of retribution prophesied by ol' Rufus begins.
