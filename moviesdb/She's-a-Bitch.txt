She's a Bitch

 Bob is an average guy and his life is normal enough, except for the soul-sucking demon that is his girlfriend Rachel. Pretty though she may be, she is absolutely awful through and through. Having tried unsuccessfully to break-up with her several times, Bob has decided the only way to end it is to kill her... and the dark comedy ensues.
