Riley's Roast Beef

 Riley is a fourth grade student who tries to learn but is thwarted by a bad teacher who seems bent on destroying his classroom of kids. When the teacher gives out all F's for no apparent reason the kids have to take matters into their own hands. They consider their options from knocking the man off to killing him with kindness. In the end their work has an amazing effect on everyone including the negative, unhealthy teacher.
