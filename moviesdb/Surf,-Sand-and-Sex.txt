Surf, Sand and Sex

 The story is held together by a beach party attended by six relatively young women. Claiming that it may be the heat that is making her do it, each woman tells of a sex fantasy that she is reminded of by the situation. Sex with an ex-husband, a man in uniform, and an automobile mechanic are stories that make up half the segments. The other three have to do with unique places where their fantasy trysts occur hours in a dance hall, and finally, in the mountains.
