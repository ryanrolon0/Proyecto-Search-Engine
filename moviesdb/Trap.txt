Trap

 Two lovely blondes are lured to an abandoned warehouse on the pretext of buying marijuana. The girls discover drug deal is a trap - Melissa and her henchman quickly bind and gag the young lovelies and are helpless to prevent Melissa's fondling fingers. The captives briefly escape and partially repay Melissa in kind, but then are recaptured and tormented further when the henchman returns. In the second vignette, Mrs. Benson thinks she is being rescued when her car breaks down, but the good Samaritans are really kidnapping her for Melissa's bondage pleasure. Finally Skye, a buxom private detective hired by Serena and Alexis to exact revenge on Melissa is captured and tied to a chair, from whence she is forced to watch as Drago makes passionate love to the roped and muzzled Melissa.
