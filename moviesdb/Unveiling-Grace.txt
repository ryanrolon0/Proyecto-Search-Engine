Unveiling Grace

 Micah Wilder was a well-respected missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Six months into his two-year mission, he was challenged by a Baptist minister to do an in-depth study of the Bible. This started Micah on a journey that culminated in his rejecting the teachings of Mormonism and embracing evangelical Christianity. Furthermore, his transformation initiated a similar transformation among several family members and fellow missionaries.
