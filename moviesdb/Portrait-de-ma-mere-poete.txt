Portrait de ma mere poete

 Intimate portrait of Marie-Jo Gobron, Belgian poet and the director's mother. 20 years after the release of a film about his father's paintings, the filmmaker continuous the description of the artistic universe of his parents. Born in 1916 in Flanders near the French border, Marie-Jo writes mostly in French. Aged 85, she starts an autobiographical novel about her youth, its many events, and about her daring emancipation in art and love, which she confides here.
