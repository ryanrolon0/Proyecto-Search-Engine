The Eleventh Commandment

 A wealthy but unmarried woman dies, and since no heirs can be found, her estate will automatically go to her attorney. The attorney's partner, however, would like to get his hands on the old woman's money, so he hatches a scheme with a barmaid and a distant relative of the woman for the barmaid to pose as the dead woman's direct descendant so she'll collect the estate and they can all split the proceeds. However, things don't go exactly as planned.
