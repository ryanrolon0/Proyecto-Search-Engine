Swing Cat's Jamboree

 Louis Prima and a quintet play on a low stage in front of an audience at tables. They open with "Way Down Yonder in New Orleans," then Shirley Lloyd joins them to sing "I Can't Give You Anything But Love." They do a quick "If She Loves Me," with Prima singing. Then, from one of the tables in the audience, Ted Gary sings "You're an Education" to Mitzi Dahl, then the two of them tap dance. The band finishes with an up-tempo version of "Loch Lomond," and the audience hits the dance floor. The quintet includes clarinet, piano, guitar, bass, and a drummer who also plays vibraphone, with Louis Prima on trumpet.
