We Are the Ztems

 The Ztems are massive in Finland but have yet to break in the UK despite having released over 17 albums, one of which spent three weeks at number 2 in Finland's main download chart. In order to try and make it big, they have arranged a series of 9 gigs in the UK. The cameras follow them on their road trip, with small venues, cheap hotels, motorway service station dinners and rhythmical differences.
