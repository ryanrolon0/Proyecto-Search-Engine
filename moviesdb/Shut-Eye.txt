Shut-Eye

 A dark contemporary gangster drama set in Chicago, SHUT-EYE derives its edgy chemistry from conflicted loyalties. Two couples use their insider status at a strip club to plan a robbery they believe will be foolproof. Family ties and mob allegiances become confused as betrayals, reprisals, and changes of heart set the stage for an unexpected climax. This seventh feature by Chicago director Covert uses the freedom of access afforded by the digital camera to emphasize the visceral quality of the story.
