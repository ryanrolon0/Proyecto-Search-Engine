The Rattled Rooster

 A rooster is unable to get worms; the other chickens either get there first or trick him out of the worms. But there's one worm nobody else competes for, because it's a trickster. It uses the garden hose, a balloon, toothpaste, and a high-voltage line to fool the chicken. It gets the chicken stuck in a pipe, then launches it with a hotfoot. The rooster doesn't believe it, so the worm launches him again. The worm then attaches a baby rattle to his tail and fools the chicken, but a real rattler mistakes the worm for her child. The worm and rooster team up to get the rattler stuck in a fence, using a couple of golf balls, then shake hands and walk away. The light finally dawns on the rooster, and he comes back after the worm who traps him in the fence, right next to the snake.
