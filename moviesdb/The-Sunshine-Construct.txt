The Sunshine Construct

 Set in alternative 1930s reality where global warming has lead to the extreme rise of ocean levels; one city on earth survives through constant construction of buildings on top of buildings to escape the ever-rising sea. In this sinking metropolis, the story follows Julian, a failed detective turned fast food photographer. In a lonely diner on new years eve he meets what just might be the love of his life, before getting caught up in a gritty murder later in the night. This animation is the culmination of a whole years work by myself; the beginning of an cinematic film noir love story/murder mystery.
