The Long Rope

 A federal judge is sent to a town to preside in a murder trial. He discovers that the defendant, a poor Mexican, is accused of killing the brother of a powerful landowner, and the townspeople are in no mood for the niceties of a trial. The judge, who has come to believe the accused is innocent of the murder, has to find the real killer before the defendant is railroaded to the gallows.
