The Last Ride

 The Last Ride takes place shortly after the events of September 11, 2001 when a terrorist organization from London comes to the United States and hatch out to them what is a fool proof attack against the United States. Within 24 hours they have recruited two young Muslim teens, Aryan (Sasan Shabrou) and Maze (Ian Brandon) to carry out the attack. Starting at the final ten minutes of their lives Aryan and Maze begin to question the motives and morality of the attack. The boys talk about everything from 40 virgins, to the International relations of the Bill Clinton era, to life as an Afghan immigrant living in America.
