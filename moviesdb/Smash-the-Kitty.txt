Smash the Kitty

 A satirical fable on the clash of rural idealism and urban amorality, exemplified by a recklessly ambitious newspaper intern. The conniving small-town would-be reporter ultimately commits a most dastardly act in the name of a juicy story. By testing the limits of taste and decency, she unwittingly gains entry into Gotham's seedy world of tabloid journalism.
