Tschetan, der Indianerjunge

 Montana 1880 Shepherd Alaska wants to pass the winter with his herd in this lonesome region. He saves the young Tschetan, one of the last of the tribe Lakota, from being lynched for cattle theft. Slowly they befriend each other and together they stand up against their mean neighbor, a self-righteous rancher.
