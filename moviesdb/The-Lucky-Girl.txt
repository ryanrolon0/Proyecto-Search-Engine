The Lucky Girl

 A warm, caring mysterious man is forced to tell a troubled little girl the story of her life or she will never speak again. He does so under protest. As we watch this tale of depravity and debauchery unfold, we grow more and more sympathetic to our young heroine. And left both shocked and relieved to learn of the world to which she now calls home.
