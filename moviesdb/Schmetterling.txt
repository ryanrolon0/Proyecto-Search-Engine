Schmetterling

 Anne has waited nearly a year for this day to arrive new monarch butterflies, the first of the season. As she plays with the fragile creatures she is reminded of her grandmother who first introduced her to the magic of their transformative process. She combines aspects of her grandmother's lessons and those of the strong, migrating butterflies to form a model for her daily life, as she shares with them her hopes and dreams.
