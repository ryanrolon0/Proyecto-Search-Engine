The Noise

 Benji just drove 3000 miles across the country for a girl he met only once. His two best friends, Brent and Rose, came along for the road trip of a life-time. But somewhere along the way, Benji and Rose became a little more than just friends. Now it's time for friends to say goodbye and Benji finds himself on a LA rooftop with a major decision on his hands. Was the girl he loves sitting next to him all along? Will he run after her? Will he let her go?
