Potcircle

 Stevie takes his prom money and buys a big bag of weed. While his sex-addicted stepmom chaperones outside the dance, Stevie and his raging, wheelchair-bound sister Debbie have their friends over, including Stevie's new crush. Unfortunately, she believes Stevie is gay, and her date thinks Stevie is scrumptious. Bible-thumping prom protesters join the party, and everyone contributes to a propaganda-filled potcircle discussion of politics, sex and religion.
