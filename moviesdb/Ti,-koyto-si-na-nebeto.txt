Ti, koyto si na nebeto

 The city of Sofia 50 years ago. In the basement of a dilapidated house, in extreme poverty, lives the old Georg Henich, a Czech master who makes violins. His last pupil is the young violinist Victor. The kid is smart and sensitive and listens to the old man's stories about music, his profession, and the good old times with elation. He will always remember the 'lessons' in kindness and strength of unbreakable from poverty and rudeness spirit. END
