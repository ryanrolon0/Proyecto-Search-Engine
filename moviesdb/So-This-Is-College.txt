So This Is College

 Biff and Eddie are the best of friends. They are college seniors; roommates at the Fraternity; and star teammates on the USC Football team. Then a flapper named Babs enters the picture. Biff considers Babs his girl, and she does like him more than Eddie, but Eddie is persistent. Everywhere they go, Eddie and Biff are competing for Babs. When Eddie stops trying, Babs decides that she wants him and this causes the friendship of Eddie and Biff to end. This rivalry even affects their ability to play football together. Biff and Eddie are the best of chums and both star football players on the University of Southern California football team. The Trojans, thanks to chummy-roommates Biff and Eddie are rolling over all teams who dast step foot on the same gridiron. But then along comes campus-cutie co-ed Babs Baxter, who encourages one and does not discourage the other and, soon, Eddie and Biff are not the best of chums anymore, and it appears that this may cause the USC Trojans to lose the final big-game of the season to the Stamford Indians...(who would later change the team-name to a PC Cardinal.) (Singular). Can things get patched together before the hated rivals from Palo Alto come to town?
