When your life is out of balance and headed in the wrong direction, where do you stop to turn around? For young John Wahlberg, the unexpected detour of Taos became the rest stop that saved his life. John works as a corporate attorney in a large Washington D.C. law firm, trading his nights and weekends for extra cash and the promise of a secure future. Lyndsey Palmer (JULIE DORRIS), John's girlfriend, wants more. She's blue-blood, well-bred and has plans for John as soon as he accepts a job with her father's bank. Estranged from his own family since the untimely death of his father, John keeps his focus on the future as he heads to Aspen for the Christmas holidays to propose to Lyndsey and embrace her family's expectations. A work crisis on his way out forces John to miss his flight and lands him in Albuquerque, where he rents a car to make the drive north to Aspen. In the middle of the high desert, the car breaks down alongside the lonely highway. Exhausted and out of his element, John is stranded in Taos. Through a series of unexpected personal encounters and fateful events with the local residents, old wounds begin to surface and new perspectives emerge as John gets caught up in the events of the mystical town. Lost in the desert of Taos - where life finds its balance - John questions if dreams can truly become reality. A powerful personal journey, TAOS is about dealing with unexpected loss while forging a balance between competing family, work and personal interests.
