Carrie's patience is tested as Michelle becomes more unmanageable, and she is relieved to meet Shawn, a normal guy, who helps her to see the truth about their predicament. Michelle goes completely crazy and disappears into the night, putting her life in danger. Carrie ends up in jail. Shawn bails her out and they go in search of Michelle. When they finally find her, there is only one thing Carrie can do...
