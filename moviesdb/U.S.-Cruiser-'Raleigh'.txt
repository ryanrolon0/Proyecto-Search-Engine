U.S. Cruiser 'Raleigh'

 "A panoramic view of the 'Raleigh,' as she lies at anchor off 27th Street, North River, April 17, 1899. Captain Coghlan stands among a group of officers near the bridge. The 'Raleigh' fired the first gun at Manila, and is the first boat of the Pacific Squadron visiting New York. All the details of the famous battleship are clearly shown as the launch from which the picture was taken moves rapidly around her."
