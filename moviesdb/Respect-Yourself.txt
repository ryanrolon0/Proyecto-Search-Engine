Respect Yourself

 Spectacular rise & disgraced collapse of Memphis' socially-conscious, neighborhood-based Stax Records, which spawned many of the best soul sounds of the 60's and 70's is told mostly by its groundbreaking, colorblind executives and artists. Stax's family atmosphere and the challenges it faced in a turbulent era of social revolution and Black empowerment are illustrated by the label's great music, from 'Otis Redding' (qv), Isaac Hayes, The Staple Singers, Booker T and the MGs, Sam and Dave etc.
