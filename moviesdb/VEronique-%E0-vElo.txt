VEronique à vElo

 Veronique leaves her gilded cage of romantic expectations, embarking on a bicycle ride through a looking glass, encountering surreal characters and schisms in reality, waking up along the way. Inspired by the French New Wave films of Jean-Luc Godard, Veronique a velo features several references to his unique directorial style, from mirror gags to dance steps to jump cuts.
