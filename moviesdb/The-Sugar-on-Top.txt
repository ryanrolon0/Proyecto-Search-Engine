The Sugar on Top

 Enter the netherworld of an emotionally damaged but ambitious actress, a modern-day "Every Woman" besieged by male corruption and betrayed by the dysfunction of her own instincts. Join her in a turbo charged spiral into a bottomless barrel of despair, pain, hate and humility. One mis-step follows another, across a bridge from grim reality to an even more disturbing psychological landscape as creepy as it is violent. A close up view of our current world, out of order, minus the psych meds.
