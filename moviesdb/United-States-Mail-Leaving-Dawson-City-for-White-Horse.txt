United States Mail Leaving Dawson City for White Horse

 The mail team is seen leaving Dawson City on one of the coldest days in the winter. The men who are seated in front, are almost buried in furs. They are starting on a long and dangerous journey of 380 miles up the Yukon River, over the ice. The first moving picture ever taken at sixty-five degrees below zero.
