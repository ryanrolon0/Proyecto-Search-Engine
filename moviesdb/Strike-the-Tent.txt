Strike the Tent

 Based on a true story captain in the waning days of the American Civil War. In an emotionally charged performance, Julian Adams portrays his great-great grandfather Robert Adams, a strong willed southern Captain, who used his guns and his heart of fire to rally his men to fight for their lands. Filled with passion, blood and tragedy, "The Last Confederate Adams" is the tumultuous true story of a man divided by love for country and for Eveline McCord, his beloved girl from the north. Produced and written by the descendents of Robert and Eveline, this is an explosive, richly detailed saga of fierce combat, honor and the will to risk all that's precious for love or country.
