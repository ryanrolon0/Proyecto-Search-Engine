The Todd Newmiller Project

 Todd Newmiller's story starts with a brutal murder on his birthday...a stabbing outside of a strip club in the most conservative city in America. Police say Newmiller confessed but he denies it and gets 31 years in prison. A former film professor decides to try and help out.
