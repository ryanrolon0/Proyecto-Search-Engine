The Big Guy

 Bill Whitlock, the warden of a large prison, has a decision to make; the only way he can keep an innocent man, Jimmy Hutchins, from dying in the electric chair is to return some stolen loot that has come into his possession. It is quite a large sum, so his conscience has to work over-time, and that may not sway him, either.
