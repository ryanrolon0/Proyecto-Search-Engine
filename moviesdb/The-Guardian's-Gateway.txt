The Guardian's Gateway

 Young Kayan has never seen real magic, escaped from giants, or fought with a supernatural villain before. Discovered on the sidewalk by his "uncle" Milo, he lives a lonely life, delivering groceries for his uncle's store. But though Kayan doesn't know it, his life is about to change forever. One day while making a delivery, he finds an open door, a magic glowing stone, and a gateway to another world. But as Kayan quickly discovers, this strange land is a troubled one. Its people are oppressed by a power-hungry Sorcerer who has imprisoned its Princess and enslaved its people. The strange thing is, these people seem to recognize him! Soon, Kayan will discover his connection to this kingdom, and why he may be the only one who can save everyone in it. With the help of his new friend Isha, Kayan follows a path leading to danger, adventure, and a destiny to be fulfilled, if only he can survive the journey.
