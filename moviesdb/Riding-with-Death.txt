Riding with Death

 The ever-so mellow Agent Sam Casey is in a satellite explosion and the radiation turns him invisible. He gets a watch that keeps him visible, and he can use it to switch from visible to invisible. He is given two assignments - The first is to transport a chemical, Tripolydine, purported to be the most efficient fuel. After the cover is blown on that, and Casey uncovers and stops the Tripolydine fraud, he must then stop terrorist Robert Denby from blowing up race cars. Sam Casey is a government agent who investigates a sunken satellite. He is exposed to radiation which makes him invisible but the lab technicians are able to give him a watch that allows him to control his invisibility. He becomes a valuable asset in the fight against terrorists, which is the major plot of this movie. The evil "doctor" supposedly creates a new fuel which turns out to be an explosive. He does this to embezzle $10 million from the government.
