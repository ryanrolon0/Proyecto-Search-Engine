Vier Küsse und eine E-Mail

 Anna and Jan get to know each other in an internet chatroom and soon fall in love. But neither of them are very self-confident and so when it comes to their first meeting, both of them send a substitute. Anna sends her shapely friend Sarah and Jan sends his very handsome buddy Hendrik. Sarah and Hendrik fall for each other in a big way. But since Sarah thinks Hendrik is Jan and Hendrik thinks Sarah is Anna, all four of them have a bad conscience because they think they're ruining their best friend's love affair. But then Anna and Jan meet each other by accident and fall in love without having any idea who the other person really is. Finally, Anna makes a date with "Jan" (who is in reality Hendrik) and Jan spends a night with "Anna" (who is really Sarah) and nobody is even slightly satisfied. The chaos reaches its highpoint when Anna catches Sarah with "Jan" (really Hendrik) in flagranti. Jan assumes his best friend has betrayed him and seduced the (false) Anna. Will this confused mess ever get sorted out?
