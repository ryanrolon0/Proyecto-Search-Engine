Under New Management

 An aging Brooklyn mob boss summons his nephew Robert Monte, a Wall Street whiz kid who has been shielded from the "Family" business. The Don solicits a promise that if anything happens to him, Robert will steer his wiseguy crew legit so that they will not spend the rest of their lives in jail. Robert surrenders a reluctant promise. When his uncle dies suddenly, Robert transforms the mob social club into a real estate office and struggles to navigate the mob crew into legitimate careers. Meanwhile, a gorgeous FBI agent named Julie Capp works feverishly to build RICO indictments against Robert and his crew who just can't help reverting to their old-school hoodlum ways. In the scramble, Robert and Julie find themselves fiercely attracted to one another. Will these star crossed lovers find romance? Will Robert succeed in steering his crew legit? Will Julie's RICO indictments fall? FBI Agent Julie Capp (Kelly Overton) is told that she could be the head of her department if she is able to bring criminal charges against Robert Monte, the nephew of a recently deceased mafioso. Assisted by her male, and rather patronizing partner, she places Robert under surveillance, and finds to her dismay that he is rather intent on rehabilitating his gangsters, and opening a real estate agency, Verona Investment Properties (V.I.P. Real Estate). Efforts are underway to sensitize the mobsters, while Robert must raise $12 million to pay off a debt. Things become very complicated after Julie finds herself getting attracted to Robert; his men decide to have their way when Robert is away; rival mobsters try to kill Robert - and last but not the least - she will not only find that she has been betrayed - but her very own movements are under surveillance also.
