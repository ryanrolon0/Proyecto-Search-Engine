Titler

 Greg Roman performs eight numbers as Titler, a cross-dressing man with a woman's figure and the hair and mustache of the Fuhrer's. His dress is sleeveless with Titler's own lyrics performers of fellatio and cunnilingus. The lyrics are camp, and some have gay and lesbian themes. It's set in an abandoned and decaying state hospital, shot in sepia and against a wire fence. It dissolves to black between each tune. A small dog, a friend in a wheelchair, and a fur stole are props in a few numbers.
