Toucher des yeux

 Every day, a young lady comes to visit her grand mother, a beautiful death old woman, who can't walk or take care of herself anymore. And every time she visits, the woman is not alone. A Male assistant is here, taking care of her. A mysterious, fascinating man, who's doing such a wonderful job. It seems like the young lady isn't just coming to see her grand mother. But sometimes, love makes us become blind, doesn't it? And sometimes, the reality is too hard to be seen.
