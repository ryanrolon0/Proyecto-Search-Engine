Teenius

 Nothing ever happens at El Dorado High. However, that all changes when Eugene Youngblood -- loner, rebel, new kid at school -- falls head over heels in love with Iris Kong, a beautiful, nerdy "teen genius." Iris is obsessed with winning the school science fair; Gene is obsessed with winning Iris' heart. Things get weird when teachers and students start turning up dead at school. Believing demons are the cause, Iris, Gene, and Lewis, Gene's wizard-like best friend, team up to solve the mystery. As they get deeper and deeper into the world of the supernatural, they discover that not only does the fate of their school hang in the balance, but so does the fate of love, the universe, and existence itself.
