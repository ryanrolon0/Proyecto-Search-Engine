The Tree House Boys

 The Tree House Boys recalls a delightful tale about the importance of integrity. Set in the 1960s, the dilemma of making correct choices before God versus bending to peer pressure equally applies today. With a bit of a twist at the end, the film will leave you with a warm feeling of yesteryear, a moral lesson for applying today, and a smile to face tomorrow.
