The Resolution Pact

 Three friends engaged in a 6-month pact to become homeowners after encountering varying circumstances that gives them each the realization that renting is not ideal. Brenda is a single mother who seeks independence; Christina is an educated housewife facing infertility as her husband desires a larger home to expand their family; and Leslie is a young and naive newlywed with the American Dream in her heart, but a husband that doesn't want to be a father. These women have a friendship and bond that shapes their view of life and the answers they seek to find as they pursue home-ownership.
