Teaching and Learning in Compton

 The children can't afford to buy shoes or lunch. Teachers are forced to teach without textbooks. The school has no money for buses. The children must walk to school through one of the most gang-infested areas of Los Angeles County. Sound like a nightmare scenario from the early 1980's? This is 2005 and this is Compton. Teaching and Learning in Compton is an all-access pass to the inner-city high school experience in Los Angeles. From riots and gangs to laughter and hope, this documentary presents the uncut story of the losers and winners in the battle to educate America's youth in one of its most crime-ridden and poverty stricken cities.
