Snovi

 Suddenly a moment from the past, a shard of memory can surge, overwhelming the senses. Crystal snowflakes land precariously on pale birch trees, civilians shudder from the cold, soldiers in heavy jackets give orders, distilled details lost in the shadows of the impassive Bosnian landscape. Memories suspended in time until a narrating voice ties them into coherence. The voice belongs to the Dreamer, a composer and survivor of the Serbian siege. He is paradoxically reflective and engaged and his memories of the war threaten to deluge his present reality. His thoughts are interrupted by an Officer and facing execution, the Dreamer stalls for time, discussing music in the silence of the night. SNOVI weaves together memories and emotions and the line between imagination and memory, dreams and nightmares are inextricably blurred. The Dreamer struggles with coming to terms with the past as he tries to find himself in the present. A love story and a fantasy further conflict the Dreamer who cannot escape his own thoughts. SNOVI is a cinematic exploration of the aftermath of war, love, and the beauty of a moment.
