The Good Old Days

 On a night like any other, Marine, Thomas, Felix, and Sebastian find themselves together again after years apart to dig through old stories of youth and friendship. However, the world around them has become filled with government control and censorship. The current administration has drawn a line in the sand and as the wine flows and the tongues loosen each of our four dinner guests discover where their old friends stand. Are they terrorists, freedom fighters, or just trouble makers? Are they protectors, tyrants, or bullies? Are the reasons for this dinner as innocent as they seem? Through subtle looks and casual remarks this hand of poker gets played out until all the players have seen clearly that the good old days are gone.
