The Gambling Terror

 Brett runs a protection racket for an unknown boss. When Jeff Hayes arrives and opens a gambling den, they try to shut him down. Unlike the others who have given in, he plans to fight back. A protection racket, demanding extortion money from every business, rancher and homesteader in a western town, is opposed only by the editor of the town newspaper. Jeff Hayes arrives in town, opens a gambling casino in the local saloon and the gang, led by an unknown leader, forces the saloon owner to close Jeff's business. Jeff than begins to take retribution against the gang, after accusing the sheriff of being lax in his duty.
