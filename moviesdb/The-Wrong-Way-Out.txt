The Wrong Way Out

 In this entry in the "Crime Does Not Pay" series, young Ann Stevens and "Windy" Brown, against the advice of both sets of parents, run away and get married as they yearn for'independence.' It isn't long before they find they can't make it on their own, and one grab of easy money soon leads them on the path of crime. Despite the objections by their parents because of their young age and the associated inability to support themselves financially and independently, Windy Brown and Ann Stevens, who are basically good kids, decide to get married. They find that earning a living is more difficult than they imagined, and they refuse to go back to their parents, at who they are still angry for not providing consent in the first place. They end up getting dead end jobs at a nightclub, but when opportunity shows itself, they figure robbing a wealthy drunk of his $200 who probably can't remember them is better than working for the money. But when they learn that the police are after them, they find that the more they run, the deeper their predicament gets. Two young people get married and run away, even though their parents advise them to build up their savings first. After they get settled they can barely make ends meet. When opportunity suddenly presents itself, they start on a downward spiral of crime.
