The Mysteries of Amelia Earhart

 This documentary examines the life and flying career of Amelia Earhart, with special attention to her disappearance near Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean during her 1937 around-the-world flight. Theories run the gamut from serious to crackpot lost due to navigational error, crashed in the ocean and died immediately; they were stranded on another nearby island and eventually died after perhaps trying to radio for help; they were captured by the Japanese military and she was later executed for being a spy; she is still alive and living today in New Jersey; she was abducted by aliens. Most intriguingly, an archaeological group has recently visited nearby Nikumaroro (formerly Gardner) Island and found artifacts--pieces of aluminum aircraft skin and the sole and heel of a woman's shoe, apparently the same size and type that Amelia wore. The search continues.
