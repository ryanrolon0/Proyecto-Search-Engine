The Dixie Flyer

 The railroad is building a new line, but the workers are unhappy. That's because one of the board members, hoping to oust the man in charge of the project (Rapley), has a saboteur on site. Rapley's daughter, Rose, sneaks out to the project to become their telegraph operator and, with the help of the supervisor, "Sunrise" Smith, eventually discovers the plot and helps catch the bad guys amid several thrilling train chases. The daughter of a railroad president falls in love with the construction superintendent on a new spur line her father is building. She discovers that there is a plot to stop the line from being built that not only endangers her father's position but also the life of the man she loves. She sets out to save her father, her boyfriend and the railroad.
