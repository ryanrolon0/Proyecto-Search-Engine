The Quality of Light

 The Quality of Light is the story of a reunion between Mary and David, who were once passionate lovers - for two weeks, thirty-five years ago and haven't seen each other since. Through a funny, sometimes uncomfortable, and combative evening we learn what that brief romance meant to them and how they feel about the subsequent course of their lives. In the end, each must deal with the mysterious and, perhaps, scandalous reason their affair suddenly ended.
