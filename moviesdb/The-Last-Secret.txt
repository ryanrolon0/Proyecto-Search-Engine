The Last Secret

 A young man has a secret crush on his teacher and rather than admit his feelings to anyone, he takes his own life. He tells his "last secret" in a suicide note to his sister, because his parents would never understand. The final tragedy occurs when we find that the teacher has a secret crush of his own.
