This was not a meaningless punch thrown by a costumed stranger. It was Mallory's ex-boyfriend James who committed the crime. Now with his jaw wired shut Steven is faced with the decision to press charges, or to take matters in his own hands. Although Mallory tries desperately to help Steven swallow his hunger for vengeance. It's Steven's friends Mark and Ben who eventually persuade him to look for James. The gates open after six weeks when Steven's wires are removed from his jaw. The situation becomes similar, there's one guy who finds himself face to face against three guys.
