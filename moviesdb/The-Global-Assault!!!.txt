The Global Assault!!!

 Globe has never been shy to hold a top event in the past with the World Cup events, but this year they decided it was time for change and consequently launched The Global Assault!!!. Now while it is a contest, it remains in a class of its own because as some have said, it's the most fair, legit and open format skate comp ever held.
