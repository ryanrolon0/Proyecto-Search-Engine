The Clock Goes Round and Round

 Scrappy stops all the clocks in the house and then goes around the neighborhood stopping all the clocks. This also stops all the clocks in the world (don't ask), and everything stands still, including his pup, and all human beings and animals. (An animator's dream.). This scares him somewhat and he tries to re-start the clocks, and all moving things start to go backwards.
