The Yiddish Cinema

 Narrated by prolific writer and director David Mamet, this film is a perfect introduction to Yiddish cinema. The Yiddish Cinema traces the history of the genre through interviews, archival photographs, and film clips of many of The National Center for Jewish Film's Yiddish feature films.
