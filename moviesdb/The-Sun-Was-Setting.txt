The Sun Was Setting

 A woman is dying in her apartment. Two friends visit her and she tells them she wants to go to Chinatown. They convince her not to go, and then leave themselves. Unable to stand her confinement, the woman dies. When her boyfriend won't accompany a dying woman for a night on the town, a girlfriend agrees to go with her. Originally afraid the excitement might kill her, the boyfriend reconsiders. As they walk to the apartment door, she collapses and dies.
