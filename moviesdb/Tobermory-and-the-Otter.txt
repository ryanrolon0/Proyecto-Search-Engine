Tobermory and the Otter

 A once in a lifetime event, a solitary wild otter takes up residence in a town, and a film maker spends a year dedicated to following this reclusive animal. Filmed in Tobermory, the picturesque capital of the Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland, this unrepeatable, playful film rewards the viewer with a rich, lyrical and uplifting portrait of this star of Scottish wildlife.
