The God Memoirs

 Alone and isolated in an uncompromising world, one man's quest for understanding and reason pushes him to the limits of sanity. Whom should this man blame for his current situation, God or his past? In trying to navigate a life that is decaying with paranoia, hallucinations and delusions, violence emerges; but is this violence in the name God or an ingrained instinct of family. This is a Journey through a mind crippled and crumbling from false expectations and broken promises...in search of belonging, a desolate view of man and depression; and in the end one can only ask, "In a moment of desperation how far will your faith take you?"
