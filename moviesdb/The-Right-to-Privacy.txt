The Right to Privacy

 To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Lansdowne Productions and the Scottish Documentary Institute gathered together some of the most talented filmmakers and visual artists based in Scotland. Collectively they created the feature length documentary, the New Ten Commandments. This short, The Right to Privacy is one of those commandments.
