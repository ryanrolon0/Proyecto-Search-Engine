Six Feet Four

 A cowboy matches the description of the man who robbed the local hotel--both are 6'4''. When a young woman is robbed, suspicion falls on the cowboy again. However, he discovers that the actual culprits are a local gang headed by the sheriff. He sets out to capture the robbers and clear his name.
