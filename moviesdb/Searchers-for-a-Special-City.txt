Searchers for a Special City

 Director 'Delbert Mann (I)' (qv) and his production team are scouting locations in New York City for the filming of the movie _Mister Buddwing (1966)_ (qv). They realize that on-location filming, with all its natural imperfections, will bring a sense of realism to the movie that cannot be recreated on studio back lots. One of the movie's stars, New Yorker 'Suzanne Pleshette' (qv) who feels comfortable working in her home town, discusses Mann and co-star 'James Garner' (qv) setting an amiable atmosphere on set. Garner, in turn, credits the crew for the lighthearted tone on set of this dramatic movie. Producer 'Douglas Laurence' (qv) discusses the problems of shooting on location, including not being able to control the environment, especially in crowded New York City. At the end of the day, New York City is another integral cast member of the movie. This is a promotional short for the feature _Mister Buddwing (1966)_ (qv). We watch the film's production staff as they scout locations in New York City. They are looking for sites that fit the producer and director's vision and will enhance the mood of the film.
