Touch

 Shira gives birth to a premature baby. This isn't the baby Shira imagined she would have. All at once, everything Shira had dreamed of turns into a nightmare and she receives 'damaged' baby. Frightened by the small and fragile creature, she is unable to touch her baby, and slowly moves farther away. Lost and torn, Shira wanders through the hospital's corridors. When does the long awaited connection between a mother and her child occur, and can it happen without the sense of touch?
