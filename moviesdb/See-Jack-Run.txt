See Jack Run

 Based on the stage play, 'Who Cares?' by Gillian M. Wadds, this volatile, hand-held, social-realist drama is set in the industrial wastelands of Melbourne's western suburbs. See Jack Run sets the stage for the 'Dogma' movies and 'no-budget' credit card movies that were to come. It is a story about adolescent life on the brink. Seventeen year old Brian Johnson is illiterate and desperately coming to terms with both his family's illegal activities, and the inadequacies of a failed education. His recurring childhood fantasies of Africa are his only solace. Trapped within a world of disillusionment, freedom it seems comes from within. How Brian beats the system, with the help of his idealistic English teacher, Jan Wilson, and his girlfriend Karen Molloy, makes this an important and groundbreaking Australian movie which kicked started an entire generation of credit card filmmaking.
