The Bascom Home Guard

 Based on actual events. Set in 1864 as Sherman's Union Army burns its way across Georgia, a small village of women, left alone after the war has taken all of their sons and husbands, forms their own militia company, with pitchforks and rusty flintlocks, to defend their town. Sherman's men do make it to the town, and the women must make a stand and defend their homes, like the patriots of 1776. A new classic American story of defending home and family.
