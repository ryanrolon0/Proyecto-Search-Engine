Sing Opera!

 Sing Opera!, a follow up to the Oscar Nominated film Sing!, tells the story of how 65 intrepid singers of the Los Angeles Children's Chorus strive to hone their vocal talents for the 2007 world premiere of the family opera Keepers of the Night. From early rehearsals to opening night, the children work with professional opera singers to learn what it takes to stage a production grander than anything they've known.
