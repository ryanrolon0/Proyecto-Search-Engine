The Prince of Elizabeth Street

 Part character study, part poem, The Prince of Elizabeth Street depicts an average day in the life of a SoHo bohemian who, in hawking his artwork on the corner of Elizabeth and Prince, has come to understand himself as the last vestige of an authentic, yet increasingly rare way of life.
