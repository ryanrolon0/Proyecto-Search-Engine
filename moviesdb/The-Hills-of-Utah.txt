The Hills of Utah

 Doctor Gene Autry returns as a "doctor on horseback" to the frontier town in Utah where his father was killed and finds a feud raging between mine owner Jayda McQueen and cattleman Bowie French. Gene's only friend in town is "Dusty" Cosgrove. Gene answers a summons by Karen McQueen to treat her younger brother, but the boy unexpectedly dies and McQueen comes gunning for Gene, who is saved by French's timely intervention. When one of French's gunmen is shot down by a miner, the ranch hands attack the mine and Gene aids the McQueen forces.
