Standalone

 'The system is simple the system, puts the 'word' out on the street, spreading false rumors about his (so-called) criminal activities, drawing the police's attention away from the real thing. He commits no crimes- all he does is look guilty. 'When you're a Wrongman, you're the Devil without Hell.' Rap Step 2 Wrongman arranges his own arrest, but makes sure that the evidence is not enough to convict and imprison him. He beats the 'rap' and the police, baited and frustrated, continue their pursuit. Meanwhile, the real criminals operate with impunity. 'Cameras everywhere, people asking about my private life, big money for whoever gets dirt on me. I'm on TV, the front page too. Hell - I feel like a movie star.' Fall Step 3 is arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned. He takes the 'Fall' for his client. His sentence to be there. You have to watch it happen. So when the police ask you - they can smell the guilt on you. They can see it in your body. You were there.' But if a Wrongman breaks his contract, if he allows the system to be compromised or threatened in any way, if he goes back on his 'Word', fails to beat a 'Rap' or refuses to take a 'Fall', then he is considered a liability, a threat, cut off. He is Standalone. Standalone Once a Wrongman is Standalone, every gang in the city will focus its attention on destroying him in order to protect the system. If you are Standalone - you disappear. 'The last thing you ever want to be is your only friend.'
