This Is a Living?

 The narrator states that most people make a living working normal, routine, unexciting jobs with steady hours in offices, shops and factories. However, some people earn their living in unusual and exciting ways, and this short features clips providing some examples which consist entirely of acrobats and stunt performers. Included are a horseshoes trick shot artist, gymnastic acrobats, horseback acrobats, a horse diver, pole swayers, high wire artists, trapeze artists, and a diving stunt man. Some stunts are performed blindfolded. For most people, work is a routinized endeavor, doing the same type of work at the same time and the same location most days. But some people earn a living doing what most would consider rather odd jobs. Some such people include troupe; the Camerons, who do stunt acrobatics with horses; the Apollos and Eric the Great, both who do high pole swaying; the Arringos, high wire aerialists; a horse diver; a man named Ericson, a high diver; a young girl who when propelled off a catapult does a triple somersault into a chair; and the Flying Codonos, trapeze artists, who perform the near impossible triple somersault and will attempt the never performed double somersault while blindfolded.
