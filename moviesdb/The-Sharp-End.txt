The Sharp End

 The Sharp End takes the Australian perspective of what it was like to be in Vietnam during the war. Told through the eyes and voices of Australian servicemen, correspondents, doctors, nurses, priests, aid workers, politicians, entertainers and their loved ones at home as they re-live their experiences and emotions. Theirs is a unique story far removed from the machinations of the outside world. Theirs was a world lived in the immediate present where death determined their future. These were the people who witnessed South Vietnam - The Sharp End
