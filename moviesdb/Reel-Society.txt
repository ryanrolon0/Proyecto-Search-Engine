Reel Society

 Reel Society is an interactive movie that lets you become part of the exploits of three college students during a challenging week on campus. You make decisions for the main characters and see the consequences of choices you select. Through it all, a wide variety of issues and perspectives are shown through the development of the sociological imaginations of Molly, Dave and Gita. Your decisions will affect the outcomes of their stories. Can you help Molly, Dave, and Gita bring Pineville students a concert by one of the Nation's biggest bands? Sold as a self-contained educational interactive movie or packaged with the top Sociology textbooks from McGraw Hill Higher Education, this interactive movie was years ahead of its time and spawned four follow projects.
