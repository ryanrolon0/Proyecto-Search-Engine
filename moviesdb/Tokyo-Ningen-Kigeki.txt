Tokyo Ningen Kigeki

 'Human Comedy in Tokyo', describes ordinary everyday lives without any significant incidents. Various dialogues are elaborately woven to bring tiny splits in human relationships to light, and through the three episodes the characters have their moments of realizing that they are actually in solitude. At the heart of the tale, our relationship with others and our inability to predict its effects on love, friendship, and society. A random acquaintance, a dilettante's photography exhibition, or a serious car accident force each episode's protagonist to take a hard look at his own existence.
