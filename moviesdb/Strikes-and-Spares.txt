Strikes and Spares

 This "oddity" narrated by Pete Smith begins at a bowling alley with two excellent bowlers, a man and a woman, making strikes and picking up spares as Smith narrates with tongue in cheek. Then, Andy Varipapa, a record-holding professional from Brooklyn, demonstrates the proper grip, the proper use of feet, and the proper swings for a straight-ahead and a curving delivery. In regular and slow motion, Varipapa then does a series of trick shots. Interspersed are the hapless attempts of a small man new to the sport and the comic (and racially stereotyped) enthusiasm of Sunshine, the pin setter. MGM short narrated by Pete Smith showing master bowler Andy Varipapa's skills on the bowling lanes. He can apparently make the ball go precisely where he pleases and like an expert billiards player, can produce a number of trick shots such as striking a pin in one lane and having fly through the air to knock out a pin in the adjacent lane.
