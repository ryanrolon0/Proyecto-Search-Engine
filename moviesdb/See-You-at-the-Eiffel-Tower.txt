See You at the Eiffel Tower

 Post-World War II Europe. The filmmakers Joris Ivens and Marion Michelle travel through Eastern Europe making a film about people, new life and hope. The present. Bulgarian filmmaker Valentin Valchev and his crew set out on a journey through post-Communist Eastern Europe. Valentin promised the 93-year-old Marion Michelle that he would revisit the places she had filmed 60 years earlier and make a film about it. She promised to live to see his film ready. He brings her what he has found. Through the camera she reconnects with people from all those places. The modern filmmakers' search for what it means to make films in Europe now and what it meant then turns Marion and Valentin's quest into an exploration of the general purpose of filmmaking. They both agree that a film is a way to engage with people rather than ideas.
