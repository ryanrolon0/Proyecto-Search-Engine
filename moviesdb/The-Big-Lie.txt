The Big Lie

 Solomon is a genie at the top of his game. But after winning award after award, he decides that the life of a genie just isn't what it used to be. After discussing his concerns with his otherworldly "boss," he opts to take an extended sabbatical, choosing a simpler life working in a hardware store (though still performing miracles on a substantially smaller scale). But one afternoon he is approached by a slick-talking "headhunter," who relentlessly tries to recruit him back into the magical world, promising a substantially improved lifestyle with a new employer.
