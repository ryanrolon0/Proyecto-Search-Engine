Walled In

 A young woman who recently graduated from engineering school travels to a remote location to supervise the demolition of a mysterious building. She soon discovers the horrifying secrets of the building and its past inhabitants, many of whom were victims of a vicious murderer who entombed his prey alive within its walls. Now she must turn the tables on the killer before she becomes his latest victim. On the day of her birthday, the young engineer Samantha "Sam" Walczak is assigned by her father to conduct a structural analysis of an eight-floor building. One hundred and twenty units are located in the middle of nowhere and require demolition. Sam finds four tenants, having received the eviction notice, but are still living in the building and her teenage son Jimmy, Burnett and lady Denise. Mary lodges Sam in apartment 208, furnished as the former dwellers have never collected the furniture. Jimmy befriends Sam and advises certain "rules" to be adhered to. Sam is haunted during the nights by ghostly noises and discovers that the building has dreadful secrets. She investigates further and finds that the successful architect, Joseph Malestrazza, built the place following the principles of the Egyptian pyramids. Twelve years ago, one revengeful worker walled dwellers in, including Mary's beloved husband, entombing the victims in cement. Over time weird things happen to Sam and she believes that Jimmy might be playing a prank on her, until she finds out the shocking secret of Malestrazza and his building.
