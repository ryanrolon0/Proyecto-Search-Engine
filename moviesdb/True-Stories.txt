True Stories

 Documentary account of the events leading up to the Munich Agreement of 1938 using newsreel footage (mostly Movietone) and interviews with witnesses and historians. The "leading players" are referred to by nicknames (Hitler is the godfather, Mussolini the fixer, Chamberlain the dealer, Joseph Kennedy the businessman, etc). Interrupting the narrative is a sketch in which Neville Chamberlain, played by John Cleese, is "directed" by Peter Cook in delivering his famous "peace in our time" speech at the foot of the aircraft steps at Heston.
