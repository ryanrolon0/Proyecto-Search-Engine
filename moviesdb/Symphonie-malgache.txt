Symphonie malgache

 In the wake of Jean Laborde and of General Gallieni, France goes on with modernizing the island of Madagascar. Schools are created in villages as wall as universities in big towns. New roads and the railway now criss-cross the country while the port of Tamatave is being converted. Everyday life is also evoked, notably through the markets in Tananarive.
