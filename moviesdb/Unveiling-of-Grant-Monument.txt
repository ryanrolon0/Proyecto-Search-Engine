Unveiling of Grant Monument

 "Here is shown the unveiling of the monument to the hero of Appomatox, General Ulysses S. Grant, which took place in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, Thursday, April 27th, 1899. Regiments of soldiers are plainly in view marching around the monument, and after taking up the position assigned to them, at a given signal the granddaughter of the great general pulls the cord, which releases the huge American flag, and the beautiful monument appears in all its grandeur. Thousands of people can be seen dotting the hillsides, and President McKinley is seen on the reviewing stand."
