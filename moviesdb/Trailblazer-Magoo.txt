Trailblazer Magoo

 The near-sighted one decides to take a hunting-and-fishing trip, and hires an Indian guide. He quickly grows impatient with the guide and takes over leading the way. He winds up in a big city and in a park lake, trail-blazing his way over park benches, statutes and through the zoo, releasing a lion along the way.
