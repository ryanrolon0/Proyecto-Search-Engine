Big shots from the former regime have meanwhile built up new careers, having caught the crest of the privatization wave. Adopting the appropriate cynicism and employing mafia tactics, they line their pockets and reinforce their position.

In a wholly random selection, the role of anonymous pawns is entrusted to Doka and Bonzo. With a lucrative reward in their sights, they set off for Silistra, unaware of what they are getting themselves into. Two best friends get involved into the domination games of two mafia bosses in post-communist Bulgaria.
