Sai da Frente

 Isidoro Colepicula is a humble truck driver hired to transport some furniture from São Paulo to Santos, in his worn out truck he calls "Anastácio". Hiding among the pieces travels a bride who's trying to escape her own marriage. With his dog CoronE, he gets himself into many amusing situations, especially when the packed vehicle is left without brakes on a steep road, and he has to chase after it.
