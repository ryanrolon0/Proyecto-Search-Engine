Run Zombie Run

 Zombies are everywhere. A man runs for his life through the city streets. Tired, scared, wounded and alone, he happens upon another man also running for his life. They join forces and seek shelter from the land of the dead. Upon finding a safe place to hide, they also find safety in each other's arms. The classic boy meets boy story takes a deadly zombie twist.
