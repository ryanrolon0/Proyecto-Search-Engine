Salem's Lot

 Young novelist returning home to Salem's Lot after many years is disturbed by the strange behaviour of its people. He begins to believe that the source of the trouble may be the eerie old Marsten House that overlooks the town. Sinister events bring together a writer fascinated with an old hilltop house, a suave antiques dealer whose expertise goes beyond bric-a-brac and the dealer's "partner" - a vampire bent on draining the local bloodlines. Salem's Lot is a town which a new member, Mr. Straker, has taken as his new "home", and has a mysterious partner, namely Mr. Barlow. Not too long after Straker arrives in Salem's Lot, people start disappearing from sight and dying from odd causes, and no one is sure why, including Ben Mears who is in town to write a new book on the town's rumored haunted house called the Marsten House, which overlooks the town and hides a terrible secret about to be unleashed.
