 Christian Taylor, a writer on hit TV series Six Feet Under, is being profiled by a British documentary crew when he's sacked, though he doesn't know they've overheard the firing. They follow him to Las Vegas, where he is ostensibly doing "research" for the next season, but is actually pursuing a dream to become a dancer in a Vegas show.
