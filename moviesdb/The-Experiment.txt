The Experiment

 In 1989 two University of Utah chemists announced that they had solved all of the world's energy problems with some electricity and seawater in a jar. Ever since then, "cold fusion" has been called pathological, voodoo science, and just plain wrong by the media, the government, and mainstream scientists. But no amount of debunking and bad press has stopped a group of contemporary cold fusionists from pursuing their goal of saving the world with clean, cheap, and abundant energy--if they can only make their experiments work! Now, on Oct. 4, 2009, 20 years after that first announcement, these scientists--amateurs and professionals from all over the world, working in government, university, and homemade basement labs--are holding an international meeting in Rome, to share their experiments and make their own world-shaking announcements.
