Sunny Boys

 Young or old, naturists are known to be a hearty and dedicated bunch. In much of the world, if the sun is shining, most are ready to shed the confines of clothing and soak up its precious rays. But if you live in the Ukraine, even the brightest late-winter sunshine is way too chilly to bask in. So, for Sergey and Stas - best buddies and the only naturist kids-on-the-block, a little ingenuity is in order. How about a trip to the local sauna? On a weekday they can have it all to themselves. Powered by the visual inspiration of a Black Sea summer vacation video, our clever nature boys can kick back, enjoy the heat of the sunlamps, and plan for warmer days ahead.
