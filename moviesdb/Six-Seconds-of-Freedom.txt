Six Seconds of Freedom

 The story of the Angola Prison Rodeo told through the eyes of the participants... convicted rapists and murderers. They do not practice. When it's rodeo time they simply put on hats and spurs and become cowboys. Often referred to Gladiators without the Lions, the Angola Prison Rodeo pits man against beast in some of the most unusual rodeo events ever witnessed. So hang on, it's one of the wildest rides you'll ever take.
