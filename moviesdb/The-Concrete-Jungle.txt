The Concrete Jungle

 "The Concrete Jungle" is a feature-length documentary that explores the complex relationships that exist between humans and wildlife in urban settings. Today, with 8 out of 10 people living in cities and suburbs and with wild habitat receding at an alarming rate, a crisis looms population explosions, one shrinking terrain. Broken up into three acts, the film will introduce viewers to the past, present and future of our long-standing tug of war with the nature. Stretching from New York to New Delhi, "The Concrete Jungle" presents the successes and failures of city dwellers facing this growing global concern.
