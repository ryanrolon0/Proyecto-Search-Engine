Virtue

 Imagine a world where one ruling class has the right to kill those in lower castes often for minor insults or infractions. The power over life and death. Now as it was then. What if we had to live by this code? Hyado of the Dragon clan is the beneficent young governor of his province of Lowell. He is considering an arranged marriage in order to secure peace with his bitter rival, the evil and powerful Manizomo of the Kraken clan, who governs several neighboring cities in the region. What are Manizomo's plans for Lowell? Will Manizomo's trip to Hyado's city spell disaster for the young samurai or will honor, justice and virtue prevail?
