Robin Hood, Jr.

 After the notorious pint-sized fibber Willie Whopper claims to have been Robin Hood, the cartoon segues into an adventure in which Willie is the singing-dancing Robin of Sherwood Forest. Maid Marion, imprisoned in Ill Manor and soon to be forced to marry the evil Prince John, writes asking Robin for his help. Robin disguises himself as a jester, comically disrupts the wedding and battles Prince John.
