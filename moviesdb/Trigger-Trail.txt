Trigger Trail

 Before it became the Oklahoma Territory, Rance Hudson, a crooked eastern-financier, schemes to steal their land from the ranchers for a railroad right-of-way. Clint Farrell returns from law school to find many of his friends illegally jailed by Hudsonm and his boyhood pal, Sheriff Bob Reynolds, unable to cope with the situation. Clint takes matters in his own capable hands, rounds up some fighting-mad ranchers, and plans and executes the complete routing of Hudson and his henchmen. Clint Farrel returns from law school to find a railroad man named Hudson and his henchman running off ranchers along the railroad right-of-way. Clint tries to organize the ranchers to fight Hudson's depredations until the U.S. government can send investigators, but the railroad man knows that, in order to claim squatters' rights, the ranchers must have a 12x15 farmhouse on their property, or the land becomes forfeit. His owlhoots resort to arson to execute their land grab and frame Clint for murder to get him out of the way.
