Redemption, Inc

 Evan Freeman is a confident and charming self-help speaker for 'Life Redemption, Inc', a questionable organization which offers self help classes to the masses. Evan loves his job, makes good money, has his dream home and is engaged to the love of his life who is pregnant with their first child. But all of this starts to change as he starts to feel guilty for exploiting various attendees for their personal wealth, instead of helping them solve any of their life problems. Unable to hide his guilt and continue living pretending all is well, Evan decides to do the right thing even if it means going against the core values of the very organization he represents.
