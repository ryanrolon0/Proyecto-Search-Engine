The Stork Market

 The Milky Way, which is a street made of baby bottles, leads up to the Baby Factory, which is run by storks. Babies of both sexes are produced and sent down conveyor belts for the storks to diaper them. More than just humans are produced at the baby factory. In the Incubator Dept., storks add all nine lives to each new kitten. Easter eggs are put in the toaster-like Eggubator to produce baby rabbits. Baby penguins are incubated inside ice cube trays. An iron press creates baby chicks from eggs; but too much heat will produce a chick that is Edward G. Robinson-like, i.e. hard boiled. One of the storks turns to the audience and invites us to follow the bouncing ball and sing along to "Pretty Baby".
