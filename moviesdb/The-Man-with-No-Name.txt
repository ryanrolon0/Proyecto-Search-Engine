The Man with No Name

 The story of Jimmy, a Moped-riding contemporary Cowboy. In order to impress his dream girl he tries to stage a movie premiere - including a special appearance by Clint Eastwood - at his little Cinema in East London. While numerous friends help out to create the illusion, and the neighborhood buzzing at the prospect of a visit from a bona fide screen legend, Jimmy realizes too late that the monster he has created is already out of his control. But to his surprise things in the cinema turn out much better than anybody could expect.
