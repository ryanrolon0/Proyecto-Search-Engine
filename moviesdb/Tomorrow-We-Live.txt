Tomorrow We Live

 Julie Bronson ('Jean Parker (I)' (qv)), whose father, "Pop" Bronson ('Emmett Lynn' (qv)) operates a desert cafE, is attracting the unwanted attention of a half-crazed gangster known as The Ghost ('Ricardo Cortez (I)' (qv)) who runs a desert night club several miles away. The Ghost knows that "Pop" Bronson is an escaped convict and blackmails him into using his desert shack as a warehouse for "hot" stolen rubber tires to be sold on the Black Market. In an effort to save her father, Julie sends her sweetheart, Bob Lord ('William Marshall (II)' (qv)) an army lieutenant stationed at a nearby desert camp, away. A rival gang, led by Kohler ('Frank Hagney' (qv)), wrecks the crime czar's "pleasure of palace" and gives him a beating. The Ghost, believing Pop Bronson responsible, goes to his desert cafE and brutally shoots him before the horrified eyes of Julie.
