Sparks

 A female mayor (Victoria Principal) of Albuquerque gets embroiled in a fight over the development of a new economic center. In the midst of this, she receives blackmail photos of an overnight fling she had with a stranger and threats of blackmail. On top of all this, the city is under siege by a serial killer who hunts powerful women. When the FBI moves in for the investigation, the chief officer (Ted Wass) turns out to be the stranger. Ralph Waite shows up as a friend of the mayor pressuring her for the development. Elaine Stritch plays her mother, Hector Elizondo is the city attorney, and William Lucking is the police chief.
