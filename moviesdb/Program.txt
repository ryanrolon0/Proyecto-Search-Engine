Program

 Cis, one of the humans who have left The Matrix, is improving her skills in a virtual training program. All of the sudden she is joined by Duo, another human. After some sparring he begins a discussion about every human once in his life having doubts on making the right decision in leaving The Matrix and with it a care free life. He assures nobody can listen to them, since he blocked all communications with the interface. Cis admits she had has doubts, but Duo admits to something even bigger. He wants to return to The Matrix and Cis should come with him, even if she doesn't want to.
