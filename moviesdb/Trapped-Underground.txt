Trapped Underground

 Another in the long series in which Floyd Gibbons would take a newspaper story about some real-life adventure, re-write it to fit 10-12 minutes running time, and the Vitaphone studio would cast whatever stage or out-of-work actors were available in NYC, and assign either Lloyd French or Joseph Henabery to direct the short. This one is about a cave explorer who gets trapped and has to be rescued.
