The Bulls

 In this short tale of murder and misguided manhood, Desmond (Rod McLachlan) assumes the role of father figure for Jason (Chris Pine), a young man whose real father is incarcerated. While Desmond's heart may be in the right place, his advice is, to say the least, dead wrong. Misogyny, bigotry, and irresponsibility are the best life lessons that Des can offer as the two attempt to bury their sins.
