Rutt Deen

 India down and drinks; a beggar girl approaches in small, hesitant steps until the woman hands her the rest of her drink. The camera pans to the sky to catch a plane in take-off, engines howling. Arrival at Vienna-Schwechat airport. A photographer returns from a trip on which he has taken photographs for a book. It only takes "Rutt Deen" a few minutes to affect our perception through jet-lag atmosphere. (Peter Tscherkassky)
