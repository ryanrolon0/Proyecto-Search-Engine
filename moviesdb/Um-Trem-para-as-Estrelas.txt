Um Trem para as Estrelas

 The young Vinicius is a young saxophone player, from Rio's poor suburbs, facing an uncertain but perhaps promising future. One day his girlfriend suddenly disappears after a night of love under the stars. Day and night, often on the 'Trem' (Rio's subway lines), others with the help of a Detective and his sources, Vinicius discovers the city's underbelly low-lives, its victims, its most eccentric characters, and milieus.
