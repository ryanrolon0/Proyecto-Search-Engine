Umbilical

 Mrs. Winters has loved her son, Aaron, since adoption. His Asian heritage has never bothered her, though she is African American. As a gripping illness takes hold of her body, Aaron's Caucasian girlfriend, Renee, introduces herself. Years of civil struggle bring Mrs. Winters' patience to a dead halt. Are the color lines too wide to cross? How deep do still waters run? People of 3 different races strive to make amends before nature denies the chance.
