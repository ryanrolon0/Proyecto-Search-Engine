Talking to Americans

 In this show, comedian Rick Mercer pokes fun at the great Canadian irritation that while Canadians know so much about the United States, Americans on the other hand, know next to nothing about Canada. In response, Rick Mercer conducts interviews in which he asks Americans, ranging from ordinary citizens to politicians, their opinion about patently ridiculous statements about Canada and records their unquestioningly ignorant responses.
