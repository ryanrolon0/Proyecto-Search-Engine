Rumba Sunday

 A short visual postcard from Cuba and its rumba gatherings such as Rumba Patio and Rumba Alley held each Sunday throughout Havana and beyond. This short video looks at the passion and artistry of Cuba's music and dance culture that is intrinsic throughout the island. Shot entirely in black in white, photographer and producer Pete McBride explores the rhythm and religious devotion of rumba which can serve as pure musical recreation, an escape the trials of life or a serious offering to different deities. The film also highlights the Cuban spirit and celebration of human movement regardless of age.
