Raise the Song

 This 60-minute documentary produced by Penn State Public Broadcasting (WPSU-TV) examines the people and events that have taken the Commonwealth's land-grant university from its humble roots as the Farmers' High School to an internationally recognized place of learning. Since the charter of the Farmers' High School was adopted in 1855, America has seen 30 presidents, a civil war, the women's suffrage movement, the Great Depression, two world wars, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the September 11 terrorist attacks-but through it all, Penn State has become one of the world's foremost teaching and research institutions, touching nearly every important era and event in American history.
