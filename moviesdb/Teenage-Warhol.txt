Teenage Warhol

 In this urban ghost story set in a supermarket, we find our heroine Isabel resigning her self to a life of shelf stacking and shop displays at Cheapi Cheapi Cutz, where Stanley the manager bosses her around and memory of her mother undermining her, grinds her down. She is forced into action, however, when she is visited by a very unusual ghost and given an ultimatum she cannot refuse!
