Trail Dust

 When Hoppy agrees to lead a large cattle drive north he runs into lots of trouble. First Anderson and Wilson join the drive to do what damage they can. Then Lewis and his men posing as Tail officials try to cut out part of the herd. When Hoppy sees through this ruse, they rustle some cattle and burn the camp.
