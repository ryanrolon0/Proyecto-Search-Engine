Sweet Home Blues

 A woman in her mid-Forties longs for a settled life and a man to share it with. Having ejected her current lover, she is forced to restrict her choice of partner to those with skills in building or carpentry so she can renovate the tumbledown house she inherited. To find such a dream match, she resorts to a dating agency but her carefully laid plans soon flounder when she finds herself falling in love.
