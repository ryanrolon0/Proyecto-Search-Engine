Souris, tu m'inquietes

 Family happiness often rests on an unsuspected drama of the woman whose life becomes that of her husband and children. In the face of "the malaise which goes unnamed," Francine, a seemingly fulfilled young woman, will be brought to the point of temporarily leaving her family in order to find out who she is. This film bears witness to the complexity of life and daily existence as perceived by a QuEbEcois woman.
