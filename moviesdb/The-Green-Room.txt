The Green Room

 A light hearted romantic comedy about a group of zany people making big plans for the summer fiesta. The high school play is having trouble with it's leading lady and the city council is planning a big announcement - to change the name of the town as part of a new reality TV show. Art and identity are examined in this bergmanesque romp.
