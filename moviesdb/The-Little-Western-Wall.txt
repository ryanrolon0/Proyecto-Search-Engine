The Little Western Wall

 The Little Wall is a narrow alley that Jewish worshippers consider to be a continuation of the Western Wall. For local Palestinian residents, the alley is known as Rabat al-Kurd, and is used as a passage to gain access to their homes and as one of the entrances to al-Haram al-Sharif, the Temple Mount. This film documents one day, from sunrise to midnight, at the so-called 'Little Wall,' as Jewish and Muslim worshippers pass by one another.
