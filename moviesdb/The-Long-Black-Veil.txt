The Long Black Veil

 A lush, period Gothic mystery set in a small town in the American south of 1967. A free-spirited 15 year old girl, pretty and popular, is pregnant, but won't tell anyone who the father is, she won't get married and she doesn't want to have the baby. Abortion is still illegal in Louisiana. The Sheriff, a worldly man with years of experience in these matters, seeks the man. There are plenty of suspects, and everyone in the audience will have their favorite choice right up until the shocking ending.
