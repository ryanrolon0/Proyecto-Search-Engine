Snow Storm

 "We present this picture as being one of the most novel that has ever been shown to the public. It was taken during an actual snow storm, not a ray of sunshine visible. The background is formed by the entrance to Llewellyn Park, Orange, N.J., the lodge house with its roof covered with snow being to the right. The limbs of the trees are heavily loaded down, and even the falling flakes are distinctly shown. Several carriages and pedestrians with uplifted umbrellas approach and lend action to the scene. One of the walkers is a high stepper, and every lift of his foot throws a ball of snow forward. Just as the picture ends his foot sends a snowball apparently right into the audience. This picture is very clear, and the subject entirely out of the ordinary line of animated picture."
