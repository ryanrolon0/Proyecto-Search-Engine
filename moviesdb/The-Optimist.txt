The Optimist

 The bride is kept waiting and Billy, the ex-suitor, proposes that she throw over Charlie and marry him instead. She agrees if Charlie does not show up by two o'clock. Charlie, the fat bridegroom, realizing he is late hails a taxicab but is crowded out. He is picked up by Billy, who fakes a car problem and leaves Charlie fiddling under the hood while Billy hotfoots it to the bride's house.
