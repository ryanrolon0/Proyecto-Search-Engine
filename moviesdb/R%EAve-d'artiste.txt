Rêve d'artiste

 An Artist is seen at work on his masterpiece and he falls in love with it, the subject being a beautiful woman. As it does not respond to his endearing words and becoming weary he lies down and falls asleep. He dreams the following which is shown in the picture. A young man enters and views the picture which becomes suddenly animated and coming down from the easel she dances with him finally returning to the frame and assuming her former shape. The artist awakens and walking up to the picture he expects to find life in it. Disappointed he takes the picture from the easel and examines it closely but with no better result and replacing the picture he gives up and despair.
