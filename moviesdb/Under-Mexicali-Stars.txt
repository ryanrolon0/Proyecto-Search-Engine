Under Mexicali Stars

 This film is so filled with modern trappings (1950's) and gimmicks that it appears to have been intended for Roy Rogers and is written in the typical take-no-prisoners style of toughness perfected by Bob Williams. Rex Allen and pal Homer Oglethorpe are treasury agents, working undercover with a traveling horse-circus act, after a gold hi-jacking gang that doubles in counterfeiting. Crabby rancher Nap Wellington and his daughter, Madeline, are the early suspects but only until Hays Lawson shows up. The climatic chase scene involves a helicopter, a horse, the Mexican secret service and a flying Rex Allen that gives Republic's outstanding corps of stunt-men a chance to shine.
