Pre-commitment

 When Damien and Simeon arrive at the hotel to finalize their wedding plans, they had no idea their focus on the day meant they forgot to focus on each other. Having been life-long friends and decided to marry some 18 months previously, it's been a long haul. Sitting in front of Tyler the wedding arranger, it soon becomes clear to them that they don't know each other at all. Tyler, the Wedding Arranger and self confessed 4th emergency service comes to the rescue. He diligently draws out the personal preferences to enable him to assess whether the couple are right for each other. He has his reputation to keep - only 5% of the couples he arranges marriages for fail, versus a national average of 33% - a fact of which he is very proud. Like an adolescent trying to make his voice heard by using posters in his bedroom to tell the world who he is, Damien finds himself in Tyler's office with nothing other than his voice to communicate with - and he's got big news to tell. Simeon, the darling, is totally innocent and doesn't understand Damien's double meaning and innuendo. However, this is something Tyler picks up on almost immediately. Although, once he's in control of the facts, he too finds it difficult to find a way of sending the right message. Through a stroke of misplaced handbag, Tyler has an opportunity to understand what true love for a woman is - in an instant. Together with Damien's stroke of a good handshake he finds his too. Innocently, Damien and Simeon walk the path to come to the right conclusion. Happiness forever.
