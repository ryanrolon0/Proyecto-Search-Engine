Prokleti

 A nameless man of a blurry past with a dark secret is sitting in the mad house and telling his tragic and horrific story, but why does nobody believe him? "The Damned" is an entertaining and stylized genre concoction in which a Gothic pulp story about eternal love, revenge and undead creatures is just an excuse for playing with atmosphere, motives and stereotypes belonging to vampire and Gothic iconography.
