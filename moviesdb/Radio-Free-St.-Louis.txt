Radio Free St. Louis

 In the age of commercial media, free speech is compromised in the chase for ratings. In this media world of crony free speech, one St. Louis radio station, "WGNU" AM 920 has stood the test of time in delivering the promise of the first amendment. The documentary highlights the unique talk show characters that make a thriving bastion of free speech. The wacky and esoteric characters represent all sides of an issue from an extreme right to extreme left wing and some who fall in no catagory but provide entertainment by way of unencumbered free speech.
