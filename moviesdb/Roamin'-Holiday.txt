Roamin' Holiday

 Tired of doing chores, such as baby-sitting, at home, Spanky and Alfalfa, with Porky and Buckwheat tagging along, run away from home, arrive at Jenksville tired and hungry. Besides hunger pangs, they have encountered a pugnacious hound-dog, a swarm of bees, and a frisky pig. A kindhearted storekeeper, who is also the town constable, helps them get back home which, they have concluded,is not a bad place to get back to.
