Surakshaa

 Rival crimelords Jagtap (Mukesh Rishi) and Dhanraj (Tinnu Anand) are after the diamond ring worn by Kiran (Sheeba). While Jagtap hires Raja (Sunil Shetty) to steal the ring, Dhanraj has Kiran's uncle Laxman Singh (Arun Bakshi) and his partner Vikram Singh (Achyut Potdar), to assist him. Then there is Suraj (Aditya Pancholi), who kidnaps Prince Vijay and takes his place to also steal the ring. And then there is Amar (Saif Ali Khan), who comes out of nowhere to get hired as a waiter in the same hotel that Kiran is staying in. As the climax comes to a close, noone is really sure who they claim to be.
