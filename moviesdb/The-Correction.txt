The Correction

 This isn't just another transgender documentary. Journalist Maureen Maher met Kayla in 2003 when she was just 11 year old, trying to convince her mother and doctors to allow her to begin hormone therapy... Kayla became one of the youngest in the U-S at the time to begin the transition to living as a boy. It was considered a medical, ethical and cultural experiment. Maher follows Kayla, now Kaden, through a seven year journey, the entire length of adolescence, through surgeries, hormones, legal issues, teen angst, sex. It's a profoundly intimate biography of both the child -- and the mother, who's been ridiculed, abandoned by family and friends and left for broke. But mostly, this is a love story between a parent and a child.
