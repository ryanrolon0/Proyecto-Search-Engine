Talking in Black and White

 1940 New York. A city rampaged by scandal and corruption. A gunshot rings in a gloomy alley. A lone detective waits in a dingy bar. A Blonde Beauty saunters it. A conversation ensues that reveals a story of lust and desperation, or loss and infatuation, of a dark secret that will change their lives forever.
