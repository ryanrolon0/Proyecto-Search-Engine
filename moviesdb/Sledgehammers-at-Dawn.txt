Sledgehammers at Dawn

 Some say it's the soil, some the relation to the moon, some that it's atop a fissure straight down to Hell itself. All we do know is that there is something about the Forsaken Zone that turns one out of four people into a homicidal maniac. The indigenous peoples of Minnesota called it, Gotchie Noo Win, which roughly means, "Earth's Anus." None ever dared settle there. But the white man was braver... In 1837 a party lead by Pastor Filo Bookbaker founded the town of Bloomington to prove that God could overcome all evils. The town experienced joyous and prosperous peace -- for five months. Then the murders began. Finally, in 1974 the United States government put the town in permanent quarantine, making the Forsaken Zone its own sovereign country and naming Mayor Earl Wisdorf as its king. Such is the world that Frank Wisdorf left behind when he moved to Los Angeles to begin a safer life. But when his father the king dies, the will determines that Frank must choose the new king. For the first time in ten years, he must return home to deal with his treacherous and scheming family...and live to tell the tale.
