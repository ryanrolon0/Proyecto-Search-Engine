Satan Since 2003

 Born in the late 1970's as a response to high gas prices, the moped was a short-lived fad whose only present-day trace is found among tight packs of young hipsters vying to keep the retro culture alive across America. For Emmy Award-winning documentarian Carlos Puga (True Life, MTV), three weeks' access to The Hell's Satans (Richmond, Virginia's premier moped gang) produced enough material for not only an eye-popping peek into this otherwise reclusive society, but also a satirical jab at the process of documentary film-making.
