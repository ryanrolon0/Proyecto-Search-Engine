Turntable Illusions

 A picture book, "Turntable Illusions," consisting of dozens of black-and-white optical illusions printed on 12" x 12" tear-out pages, intended to be spun at various speeds on a record player. The illusions include the 'Benham Disk' pattern, a black-and-white graphic that when rotated creates the illusion of color. A few of these optical illusions were filmed and synchronized to a progressive rock instrumental.
