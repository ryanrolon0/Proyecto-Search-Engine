Two Museums

 Following the lives of two rural women over the course of a year, Two Museums captures the contemporary reality of sparsely populated Southwest Saskatchewan. Although the women hardly know each other and are separated by more than fifty years of age, their lives seem to run parallel across the generation gap. Each must defend her choice to remain where others have left-facing isolation, the fury of the weather and haunting remnants from the past. Allison Sambrook grew up in a small town and has never lived on a farm. She came to the town of Morse at age twenty-one and soon found herself in the position of museum curator. The Morse Museum, where she works, stands as a monument to the optimistic dream of farm life; its collection is all that remains of the waves of immigrants who settled here to try their luck at living off the land. Selma Siemens is the filmmaker's grandmother and lives alone on her farm in the area, a few miles away from where she was born. Many of the artifacts in Allison's museum are things that Selma remembers having used; she witnessed the Great Depression from a two-room shack with her parents and nine siblings, not all of whom survived. Her greatest fear is that the joys and hardships faced by her family on their farm will be completely erased by time. Her childhood home is now collapsing into the prairie, no more than shelter for birds and cattle. First-time filmmaker Lea Nakonechny intertwines the two women's stories with depth and sensitivity. The measured pace of life in Southwest Saskatchewan and all its rich detail are savoured by her camera, resulting in a uniquely cinematic documentary experience. The breathtaking landscape is fixated upon with blinding intensity; changing seasons symbolize the renewal of hope and the pangs of loss that define this beautiful but unforgiving place.
