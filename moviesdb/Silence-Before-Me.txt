Silence Before Me

 Silence Before Me is an exploration into the soldier's psyche as examined by a psychotherapist, military chaplain, Iraq War Veteran, and the widow of a warrior. The documentary unveils the reality of war that is rarely seen on the nightly news or Hollywood films. It's the conversation we should all be having, but are too afraid to initiate.
