Tails from the Land

 With the population of the planet at six billion and rising, is it possible to sustain both ourselves *and* the Earth? At a remarkable farm in northern New Mexico, decades of working the fields organically have produced soil that teems with microbial life, grows certified grains for feed and seed, and produces 1,000 free range turkeys for the holiday table. The stewards of this farm are growing living soil, and turkeys are an integral part of that cycle.
