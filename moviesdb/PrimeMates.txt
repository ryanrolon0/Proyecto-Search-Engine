PrimeMates

 Primemates is a disturbing and honest conversation among four men in an exclusive cigar shop. They talk about love, relationships, and sex. While exploring men's fascination with younger women, Primemates delves into many political taboos usually associated with the intellectual. When four men sit down to have a cigar together their discussion naturally turns toward the topic of women. In this exclusive atmosphere, the men let down their guard and talk freely about sex, desire, and their female counterparts. With the understanding that people act on animal instincts and using evolutionary psychology as a frame of reference. Ray (a psychologist) asserts that the only way to live a happy marriage is to have as much sex as possible...with OTHER women. What ensues is a discussion in which each defends their position and reveals their deepest and darkest secrets. PRIMEMATES is a film that uncovers the truth about our behaviors, needs, and evolution. Facts that every woman is afraid to know, and what every man feels trembling deep beneath the surface.
