Shared Visions

 The work of Havana, Cuba artist Adrian Pellegrini and Santa Fe, New Mexico artist, Chris Richter, come together in Shared Visions, a documentary filmed entirely in Santa Fe, New Mexico during the week of an exhibition of the same name. Early in 2010, Hahn-Ross Gallery owner, Tom Ross, artist Chris Richter, and Cuban-American Geo Darder conceived the idea of bringing Cuban artists to the United States as part of a cultural exchange experiment. Adrian is the first of those artists and this collaboration represents the first opportunity to show his work in the United States. The film follows the three collaborators as they prepare for exhibition, and the arrival of Adrian and his artwork from Cuba.
