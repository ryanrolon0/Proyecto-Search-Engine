The Color of Sound

 A documentary of a one night interactive concert featuring local visual artists and musicians. The event exhibited the relationship between visual art and music. Four artists painted on several canvasses while listening to a jazz and a blues band jam. The interaction the visual artists had with the musicians was purely improvisational as were the finished works. The musicians did play synchronized music, but they also had a jam session together based on their musical experience and memory.
