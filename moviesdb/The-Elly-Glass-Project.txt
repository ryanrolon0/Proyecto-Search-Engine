The Elly Glass Project

 This documentary profiles Elly Glass who through amazing will and ingenuity rescued her husband from Buchenwald Concentration Camp in 1939. Henry P. Glass went on to build one of the first solar houses in the United States and became one of this country's foremost industrial designers. Now at age 92, and still as amazing as ever, Elly finally has a chance to tell us her story. What emerges is a portrait of a couple whose ideas about "living green" were far ahead of their time.
