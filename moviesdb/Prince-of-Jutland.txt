Prince of Jutland

 This re-telling of Hamlet goes back to the original Danish source material. The opening scenario remains the same brother who then weds the widowed mother. Hamlet must discover his strength and leadership that will allow him to regain his rightful throne. Don't expect an ending which matches the Bard's though, this is more like a true Viking epic.
