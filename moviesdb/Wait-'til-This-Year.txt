Wait 'til This Year

 This movie follows the historic 2004 Red Sox Season as seen through Monika. The movie creatively combines reality, documentary and scripted scenes to tell the stories of Monika and Jes, two diehard Red Sox season ticket holders, and also Rob and Alex, two best friends. Alex is a Yankee fan and Rob a Sox fan, through winter, spring, summer and fall, from the heartbreak of Aaron Boone's home run to the triumphant last out of the 2004 World Series. This movie has appearances by former Red Sox stars Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Bill Lee, and Carl Yastrzemski. A Red Sox lovers dream!
