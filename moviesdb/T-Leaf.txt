T-Leaf

 Through the dusty streets of Africa, the scorching wilderness of Australia, the gun slinging Wild West of America and the colourful culture of Mexico, kleptomaniac on the run, Terrence Leaph, is a fish out of water and struggles to survive in the only way he knows how, by stealing things! But he's not in the East End of London any more, and Terry finds his new surroundings more than just a culture shock. As if the heat, the language barrier, and the locals weren't enough to deal with, his plight is made even worse by his convicted gang mates (believing they were double crossed) accidentally hiring two contract killers - upper -crust Etonian Hal and the street smart, Chavvy Essex girl Kylie. From different ends of the class divide, these two fierce rivals both want to take the credit and the bounty for killing Terry first.
