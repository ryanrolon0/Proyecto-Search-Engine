The City of Little Men

 A profile of Boy's Town. Father Flanagan outlines his philosophy and then talks with a lad who's traveled on foot from Chicago, with his dog, hoping Father will take him in. The film then looks back 25 years when Flanagan started the place with three wards of the court and $90. In the present, we see Boy's Town's 200 residents rising early, studying, working, and governing themselves. All learn a trade; all do real work, raising food, editing and printing and mailing a bulletin to thousands of supporters, doing laundry. Boy's Town's sports teams excel. Love triumphs over family circumstances and bad choices.
