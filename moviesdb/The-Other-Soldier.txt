The Other Soldier

 June 6th, 1944. D-Day, Normandy, France. Two 82nd airborne US paratroopers miss their drop zone due to heavy enemy fire and land behind enemy lines. They are scattered about 8km from their rendezvous point. They are ambushed by German soldiers as they try to make their way to their objective. Halfway to St. Mere Eglise they are confronted by what appears to be an enemy Sniper. With courage, honor and sacrifice they must stand their ground. In battle they willingly accept their fate to defeat their enemy in order to survive and complete their mission for their country.
