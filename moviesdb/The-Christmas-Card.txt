The Christmas Card

 US Army sergeant Cody Cullen's horror tour in Afghanistan ends when his fellow soldier Jonesy is killed in an attack while they are delivering medical supplies in Nurestan. Cody is put on leave and goes to return private possessions to Jonesy's bride turned widow. On his way home he passes Nevada City, California, where he meets Faith Spelman, who writes the parish's Christmas cards to lonely soldiers, who had coincidentally included him, an orphan. He happens to save her dad Luke from a serious car run-over. The Spellmans invite Cody home for dinner, then the Christmas tide. He proves a great help in the family logging firm. Vietenam vet Luke wants Cody as son-in-law, but although charmed, Faith still seems committed to rarely present fiancE Paul, a wine broker.
