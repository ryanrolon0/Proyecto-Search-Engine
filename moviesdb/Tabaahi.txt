 When honest Thanedar Harnek Singh comes to know that Mantri Balwant Singh is involved in drug trafficking, he decides to expose him at any and all costs. Despite of veiled threats to him and his family, which consists of his widower father; wife; daughter, Guddi; sister, Janki and her husband Dr. Ram Kumar Sharma; and brother, Sukhchen; he carries on. One day his dead body is found by the Police. Sukhchen comes to know that another police officer, Sheva Singh, and Balwant are the culprits, and he sets out to expose them. Shortly thereafter the Police raid their house, find unauthorized weapons, arrest Sukhchen, hold him in a cell, and torture him. Harnek's widow approaches DIG Vijay Tandon and pleads with him. Before Vijay could intervene, Sukhchen escapes, and joins a gang of bandits, not realizing that soon the remainder of his family will become easy targets of not Balwant's goons, the police, but the local community itself.
