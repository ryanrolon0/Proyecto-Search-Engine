The Townships Project

 The Township Project explores the experiences and successes of Micro-Loan clients in South Africa. These clients are small business owners, living in the Townships - the poverty stricken, segregated areas of South Africa. Micro Loans allow them to build their businesses and to become financially self sufficient. This film reveals the challenges and accomplishments of these extraordinary small business owners living in a post apartheid South Africa.
