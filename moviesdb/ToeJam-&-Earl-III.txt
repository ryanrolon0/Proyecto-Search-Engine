ToeJam & Earl III

 The 12 sacred Albums of Funk are missing from the planet Funkotron and it's believed that they are on Earth. Having survived Earth before, the funky duo, ToeJam & Earl, along with their new friend Latisha, take it on themselves to recover them. Later they discover a disturbance in the funk balance and have to deal with the evil side of the funk - the 'Anti-Funk'. The gameplay involves running around randomly generated 3D areas, and neutralizing earthlings with 'funk fu', all the while searching for and picking up items and power-ups.
