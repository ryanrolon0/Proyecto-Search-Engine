The Franklin Abraham

 The Franklin Abraham is a building 2 kilometers wide, 3 kilometers long and in places 175 stories tall. It reputedly once inhabited a population of over 2 million people. The edifice began as a residential tower designed in the once fashionable Rococo-Moderne style. In the 200 years since its inception it has expanded into an amalgamated superstructure that encompasses all aspects of civic life education, government and entertainment. Jonah Freeman’s film is a circuitous journey through this vast, labyrinthine structure. The camera assumes the position of a voyeuristic, roaming eye that passes through the lives and spaces of an interiorized society. Particles of stories or characters are explored briefly and then left behind girl and her older newspaper-stealing boyfriend; a timid office worker on a date with a sinister-looking romeo; bored, subterranean youth gangs; the tribulations of the family and mega-corporation that own the building; a moisturizer-huffing bartender and her angry patrons. The segments focus on details of everyday life while simultaneously implying the gargantuan scale of the building.
