Stripper Cake

 'Strippercake' tackles many of the issues encountered by today's modern man room. A dark and ominous night. Rob shows up late to his best friend's bachelor party only to discover a half-eaten cake covered in blood and a missing stripper. The only evidence left behind is a single high-heeled shoe. Could these men have been drunk enough to murder and consume the remains of a young woman? Will their friendship be torn apart as in their drunken confusion they begin to accuse one another of such atrocities? Were they really that drunk? Really? If so, what did she taste like?
