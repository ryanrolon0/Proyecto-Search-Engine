Starship Troopers

 Taking place around the movie's storyline, you are a lieutenant (male or female) leading a squad of troopers. You first start at Klendathu (as in the movie, except you are at the "safer" side of the area.) Then you are forced to retreat. After pulling out, you are doing a lot of other missions. You have to nuke bug holes to stop bug reinforcements since they are unlimited, and you have limited ammo. You pick up ammo from supply crates which regenerate over a period of time. Then you also go up to the movie's ending which you get one cameo help from Johnny Rico's platoon Roughnecks. Your tasks go after the movie up to the end of the war (when you go back to Klendathu for the second and final time). You get some suits for carrying heavier fire power or two different kinds of weapons. You also have to occasionally contend with traitors and sometimes "brainwashed" dead troopers (troopers fighting on the bugs' side and the skin color is green).
