The Reality Behind Closed Doors

 9 Young Gay Men are interviewed in this Unconventional Documentary Short. All 9 men come from various areas across the country (Massachusetts, California, Texas, Indiana, Florida, Michigan, & New Jersey). However, none of the men are seen on screen, instead 9 Straight actors portray and lip-sync their appearances. The majority supports the minority in this film, as topics range from stereotypes to coming out, civil rights, and personal opinions. They may not all agree on everything, except that they do not have a choice in being who they are.
