The Alien Within

 Crew of an undersea mining platform falls prey to mysterious and dangerous parasite. The parasite has the ability to affect people's minds, so survivors can't be certain who is safe and who is infected. Trapped under 2500 ft. of crushing pressure, an underwater research team is invaded by an unknown mind-controlling alien. Terror turns to paranoia as the team members turn on each other, unable to discern friend from foe.
