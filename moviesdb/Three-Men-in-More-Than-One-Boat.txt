Three Men in More Than One Boat

 'Griff Rhys Jones' (qv), 'Rory McGrath' (qv) and 'Dara O'Briain' (qv) return for a third nautical adventure, starting at Plymouth and using a variety of vessels to travel the coast of Rory's home county of Cornwall and reach the Isles of Scilly. Along the way, the trio take some baby lobsters into their care, take up bird-watching, and get involved with a production of "The Pirates of Penzance".
