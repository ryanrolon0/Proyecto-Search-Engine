The Brewster Project

 If your ultimate dream was so close you could taste it, how far would you go to achieve it? How much would you risk? What price would you pay? And what would be the effect on those you left behind? Rekindling the legacy of the famous Detroit housing complex that spawned The Supremes and helped define Motown sound, the cost of fame in the 21st century carries a sizzling hip-hop soundtrack in the new Method to the Madness Films production...The Brewster Project.
