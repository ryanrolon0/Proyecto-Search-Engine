Tracking Memory

 Tracking Memory is a compilation of four essay films, which exposes two personal experiences of emigrants living in Taipei and Mexico City. Voice over and cut outs are the main elements to compose the narrative constructed with stop motion animation. Through the use of anecdotes and stories, the narrators describe the memory of their homeland, and the symbolic relationships with their current place of residence.
