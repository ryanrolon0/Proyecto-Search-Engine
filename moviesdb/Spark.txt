Spark

 Spark is set in a future where fire is banned, clean air is precious, and an over-protective society fears the natural disasters of the past. Young 'Very,' is the quiet, new girl in an unfriendly classroom teeming with technology, hormones and cruelty. When a false fire alarm is triggered, she is unexpectedly swept up in a rebellious crime and thrust into an outsider culture. Only with her new accomplices does she discover friendship and a more organic connection to the planet, fire and her past.
