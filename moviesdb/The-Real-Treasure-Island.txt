The Real Treasure Island

 Before there was Pirates of the Caribbean, there was Treasure Island. Critics hail it as the most famous pirate story in history. Since its publication over a century ago, Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island popularized the most potent symbols of pirate lore uncharted tropical islands and dog-eared treasure maps marked with an 'X'. And now, it appears that the novel may have been inspired by a real treasure - on an island no one has ever searched - until now. The Real Treasure Island follows Alex Capus as he travels to exotic locales to unlock the true story behind a literary masterpiece. From the foggy Scottish Highlands to the sun-kissed islands of the South Pacific, Capus follows a treasure trail of clues -each one triggering dramatic recreations that tell the true story behind Stevenson's tale.
