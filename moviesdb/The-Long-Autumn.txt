The Long Autumn

 In a land where the seasons last for ten years, a barefoot orphan washes up on the shore of an uninhabited island with no memory of where he came from. He grows up alone, believing a tree is his mother until a gang of booted settlers arrive. The boy is elated to find other creatures who look like him, but there is one problem - Booted men do not associate with barefoots.
