The Warrens

 In 1929 Russell and Blanche Warren disappeared one afternoon after returning from Port Angeles Washington. Their bodies or their 1927 Chevrolet were never found. Their two boys, Charlie and Frank were left alone never knowing what happened to their parents. The local sheriff and townspeople frantically looked for the couple, but to no avail. More than 70 years later a man named Bob Caso, ran across the old story and brought it to the attention of the head ranger of the Olympic National Park, Dan Pontbriand. Soon thereafter a dive team was sent into Lake Crescent to look for evidence of the missing couple, and shortly after that, an old car was found, a 1927 Chevrolet. Later, during a memorial ceremony, Russell's body was also found.
