The Biograph Project

 Seventy years before IMAX® astonished audiences, W K-L Dickson amazed the world with images captured on his 68mm Biograph motion-picture camera. Granted unique access to digitally scan original 68mm nitrate film elements, BioMax Films will present these films once again, in their true scale, for the first time in more than a century.
