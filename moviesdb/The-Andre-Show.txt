The Andre Show

 In this poignant documentary, filmmaker Beverly Peterson and her adopted son Andre share the story of an extraordinary friendship. Despite living with HIV from birth and experiencing poverty, deprivation, and the loss of his mother, this remarkable young boy chose to face life head-on, fiercely determined to take control of his destiny and make sense of it all. Much of the story is told through Andre's own video diaries and drawings, as he comes to terms with the physical and emotional challenges of his short yet intense life, and the struggles to create the family he had always wanted
