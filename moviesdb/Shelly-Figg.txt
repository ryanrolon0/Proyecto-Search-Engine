Shelly Figg

 Shelly Figg is a lonely outsider. Overlooked and under-appreciated, she suffers from a bipolar disorder that keeps her trapped in a dull and colorless life. During a trip to check meds with her psychiatrist, she launches into a very strange story that propels her into a larger than life adventure which includes aliens, alien hunters, and grand theft auto. Is it fact, fiction or pharmaceuticals that drive her tale?
