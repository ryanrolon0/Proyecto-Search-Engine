Somos todos iguais

 The documentary reveals how each person's unique way of being is reflected in the choices made throughout the many steps of social interaction. As we grow the habits we adopt produce differences between one person and another, therefore distancing us from humankind's natural values. It is at this point where social conflicts and differences arise. What is natural looses its importance by being denied by the larger part of each individual's attitudes. Yet, occasionally, the nearly forgotten natural values emerge in people's feelings, art and work. In this fashion we are taken, and take with ourselves, a small portion of each character presented throughout the film.
