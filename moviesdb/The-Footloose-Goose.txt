The Footloose Goose

 A pinioned trout-farm goose takes a wild gander for her mate. But when he's blown off course in a storm, and then winged, he's going to have to make his way back to her on foot, past predators and customs officers. Meanwhile, the trout farmers worry about their goose raising a brood on her own and a pretty young woman who's come to fly fish.
