Pyaar Impossible!

 A geeky U.S. student, Abhay Sharma, falls for a suave hottie, Alisha, and even rescues her from drowning. When he attempts to visit her while she is recuperating, he is not permitted to do so by her snobby friends, and he returns home to Mumbai where he lives with his dad. Seven years later, the couple are fated to meet again in Singapore - this time Alisha is a single parent, with a cute and precocious daughter, Tanya; while a dejected and frustrated Abhay is forced to assume the position of Tanya's nanny.
