The Sunflower and the Sun God

 Adapted from Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' - The Sunflower and the Sung God tells the myth of Clytie and Apollo. Clytie was a water-nymph in love with the sun god. She pined for him for nine days out of the water and under the heat of the sun until she transformed into a sunflower.
