Un par... a todo dar

 Comedy about two friends (Viruta and Capulina) who are swindled when they buy a plot of land. It turns out that the land they just purchased is actually the cemetery of a small town. Moreover, the two bumbling stooges cross paths with the local criminal, a masked robber known as "El Esqueleto" (the Skeleton). The film also stars Dacia Gonzalez.
