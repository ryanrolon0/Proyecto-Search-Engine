The Painter Sam Francis

 Forty years in the making, 'The Painter Sam Francis' is artist Jeffrey Perkins' intimate portrait of abstract expressionist painter Sam Francis. The film retraces Francis' life and career from his childhood in California to his artistic maturation in post-war Paris, his time spent in Japan, and his prominence in the United States. It reveals a man in constant struggle with physical maladies and his own demons, but for whom creativity was a powerful life-sustaining force.
