Teach

 Teach is a film that features conversations about the art of teaching and learning by teachers themselves. Each day we hear about teaching and teachers through the eyes of administrators, politicians and business leaders. Seldom is voice given of those dedicated and experienced, the teachers who work in our public schools. This documentary hopes to give dignity and appreciation to the passion, commitment and insight of those who make the choice to devote their lives to educating all of our nation's children. About the Rough Cut Submission half of Film have just a few clips. Many additional clips from the teachers interviewed will be added.
