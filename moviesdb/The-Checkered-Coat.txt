The Checkered Coat

 Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Madden is visited by a man, Steve "Creepy" Bolin, wearing a weird checkered coat, and when Madden learns that Creepy is subject to death-like trances and the fear of being buried alive, Madden concludes Creepy is obviously a psychopath (at least, until a real one comes along)with possible criminal tendencies. When leaving, Creepy tells Madden he is a friend of the doctor's no-good brother Fred, while also throwing a few sinister-and-leering glances in the direction of Madden's wife Betty. Madden wastes no time in notifying the police to pick up Creepy, evidently on a general nuisance charge of looking like Dorian Gray. But Creepy is also sneaky and eludes the police and, when next seen, he and Fred are robbing the Anson Jewelry store across the street from Dr. Madden's office and he shoots and kills both the owner and his son in the process. Dr. Madden hears the shots and rushes over but is slugged by Creepy and he and no-good Fred carry off Madden in their get-away. The police show up and immediately tab Dr. Madden as the prime suspect based, evidently, on him having an office across the street.
