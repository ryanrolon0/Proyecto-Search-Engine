Puttin' Her Ass on the Line

 A married couple each feel their sex-life has gone stale. The husband's friend tells how he met a gorgeous blonde in a supermarket, and welcomed her to South California. The husband then dates a coffee-shop waitress and helps road-test her new chair! The wife finds out and takes her friend's advice to screw the first stranger she meets - the dishwasher repairman. The wife's office colleagues get it together on the desk. The couple prove their affairs have refreshed their sex-life.
