The Brothers Karamazov

 Felt to feel. Enigmatic. Twisted. Absolute morph and absolutely on the edge Nigel Tomm's film version of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel "The Brothers Karamazov" lasts 73 minutes and 5 seconds. This is 73 minutes and 5 seconds of pure magenta screen. Nothing less and nothing more. From the outside in, and from the inside out. Unique sense of text visualization. Nigel Tomm is, however, not interested in the meaning of the text. He is interested in the layering and superposition of the text, to serve you exclusive viewpoint of perfectly charged emotions which now are expressed in the purest forms. Be provoked, challenged and inspired.
