The Peanut Butter Experiment

 The landlord wants his rent, their girlfriends want to kill them and they have less than a week to make the big score they've always dreamed of. Two out of work actors, Billy and Jeff, have five days to complete a video that could be worth $50,000. But with an empty cupboard, a dwindling supply of alcohol and their new friend paranoia knocking on the door, will they make their dream come true, or turn it into a nightmare?
