Riders of Pasco Basin

 Kirby and Evans are pulling off an irrigation project swindle and newspaper editor Scott realizes it and sends for Lee. Lee agrees with Scott and forms a vigilante group to fight the Sheriff and his deputies brought in by Kirby. But a dying Uncle Dan sets the Sheriff straight and this brings the two sides together for the big shootout. Called home from a rodeo by news of trouble in Pasco Basin, Lee Jamison stops off at the home of Jean Madison where he finds his friend Bruce Moore, in conference with Jean's father,rancher Joel Madison, and Matt Kirby, a newcomer to the valley. Kirby is promoting an irrigation deal which Caleb Scott, publisher of the Pasco Basin Sentinel, and Lee think is crooked. Madison, sold on the deal, tells Lee he is not welcome in his home anymore. Kirby has Scott killed but Luther, the paper's handyman, prints the paper and Lee organizes a vigilante group among the ranchers opposed to the project. Kirby's henchmen wound Madison, blame Lee, and Bruce, in love with Jean, swears vengeance on his former friend. The Kirby gang also burns barns and fields and the blame is laid on Lee's vigilantes.
