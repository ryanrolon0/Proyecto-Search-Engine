The Dorm That Dripped Blood

 Joanne, Patty, Brian, and Craig prepare the old dorm building to be torn down. They are pursued by a serial killer with a wide range of murder methods, ranging from power drill to industrial steam cooker. Is it that spooky weird guy John Hemmit killing off the incidental characters, or is it someone/thing even more terrifying?
