Road to El Paso

 Rancher Martin Auden's wife leaves him, his tractor breaks down, his horse is stolen, and the family store burns down. Only a few items remain from the burned ruins, including a handwritten journal from El Paso, 1886. Martin meets his ex-wife to ask her to come home. She refuses but encourages him to go after the stolen horse--to go be the man he needs to be. Out of frustration, Martin packs his bags to head to El Paso--the one lead he has. In his lonely evenings, he begins reading the old journal. His journey into the West takes on similarities of the story written in the journal. In his quest, Martin meets Skye, a single woman desperate for a new life. Skye has purchased Martin's stolen horse and set it free on her vast property. She gives Martin permission to search her land, the only condition is that she gets to go with him on foot into the 40,000 acres of harsh badlands. On their treacherous journey, they spend evenings reading the unfinished love story, only to discover new endings of their own.
