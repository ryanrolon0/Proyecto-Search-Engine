Ronny & Cindy in All of Us

 "Ronny & Cindy in All of Us" illustrates & articulates the scenes, themes and situations of the short film "Ronny & Cindy" by telling the story of real people, witnesses interviewed, demonstrating that the fictitious reality created in the short is close to the everyday reality of nowadays couples experiences. Frederic Eger found testimonies of people like you and me who went through the same experiences that Ronny & Cindy are going through in the short. As unrealistic and extreme these characters - Ronny & Cindy - were, there is a little something of that self-indulgence, self-centeredness and intolerance Ronny & Cindy share with all of us.
