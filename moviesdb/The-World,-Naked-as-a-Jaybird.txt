The World, Naked as a Jaybird

 THE WORLD, NAKED AS A JAYBIRD illustrates the destructive nature of humanity. The story revolves around Edith, a young girl who accidentally survives a massive atomic bombing. Left alone, with her entire world (literally) destroyed she goes on a journey to seek humanity, comfort and a new home. Instead, she finds melancholy, solace and several snails all going the opposite direction.
