 "He that hasteth to get rich hath an evil eye..." Proverbs 28 has surprisingly little to say about gambling, but in the desert, the adversary played the game of temptation with the son of man for all that was at stake. On the hill Calgary, at the foot of the cross, soldiers cast lots to see who would keep the Robe of Christ. Today, in a quiet alley, a card shark practices his own game flutters and disappears through the deck seemingly at his will, a lone business man approaches. The card shark will ask him to play a simple game.
