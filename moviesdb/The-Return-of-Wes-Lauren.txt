The Return of Wes Lauren

 Granville High. One year ago, star quarterback Cain Summers took on demented troublemaker Wes Lauren, kicked his ass, got him thrown out of Granville High and sent to military school. Now, Wes Lauren is coming back with his delinquent brothers, Bill and Blade. Wes plans to make Cain pay for what he did... in teeth. Will Cain's friends rally to his side? Or will he be forced to face the three brothers all by himself?
