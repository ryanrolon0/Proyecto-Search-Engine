Quiet Night In

 B-movie madness ensues when would-be novelist Jess Bartlett stages a "quiet night in" to finish her new book, fuelled by endless glasses of red wine and her favourite board game, "Cluedo". But the path to creative perfection is never easy, and as Jess moves her pieces into place, her life will unravel before your eyes in an hilarious web of confusion as she becomes trapped inside her house with a troubled footballer, a manic TV advice show host, a randy old author and an unseen chicken. She'll also debate ethics with a teenage toy-boy, confront her personal demons, and be confused by the sudden appearance of Kiwi country music legend Patsy Riggir on the soundtrack - all while wearing a woolly dress. The stakes are higher than she realises, for before the night is out, Jess will be forced to question her worth as a writer, a human being - and whether she should have made pizza for dinner.
