RiverSing 2007

 This 20 minute documentary captures the energy, beauty and joy of this Charles River celebration of the autumnal equinox. Over two hundred singers on the Weeks footbridge lead in song several thousands on the riverbanks as the Cambridge and Boston communities say goodbye to summer and welcome in fall.
