Walking Out on Love

 When Jenny isn't running her family, she's running her band. Neither one could exist without her. When 'The Disasters', a huge punk band from Los Angeles, blow through, they offer Jenny and her band a way out of their poor excuse for a town. Jenny can't imagine leaving her Mom and sisters behind, but with the guitar player, who just happens to be the love of her life, threatening to leave without her, Jenny must finally decide what might make her happy.
