Steal a Car

 Two down-and-out friends, Wes and Stan, have ventured to an indoor parking lot with the eventual aim of stealing a car to escape their lowly lifestyles. As the self-proclaimed visionary of this misguided plan, Wes' passion for auto theft is challenged by Stan's apprehension. However, with Wes' persuasion and the duo's aversion of potential disasters, the young pair actually manage to break into one of the cars occupying the lot... or so they think. The duo soon finds that they've become victims of circumstance and that what can go wrong will inevitably go wrong.
