The Quick Gun

 Returning home after a two year absence Clint, known for his fast gun, is caught by Spangler's gang where he learns they are heading for the same town where they plan to rob the bank. He escapes and although he is not welcome, he warns the few townsmen not away on cattle drives. Two years ago he had to kill two of the Morrisons. When the remaining two Morrisons come after him he kills them and just before the Spangler gang attacks and his gun will be needed, he is jailed.
