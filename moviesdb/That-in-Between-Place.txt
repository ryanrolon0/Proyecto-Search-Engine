That in-Between Place

 Taurean Price loves to watch movies. However, she finds herself in a peculiar situation when she goes to an art house theater to see the movie The Visionary. There is something oddly familiar about the movie and the people in it. What's even stranger is that The Visionary is the only movie she's allowed to see at the theater. Will Taurean be able to figure out what's going on or will she be stuck in that in-between place?
