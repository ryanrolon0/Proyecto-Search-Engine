The Lost Boy

 A narcoleptic man who believes he is Peter Pan attends a little boy's birthday party much to the chagrin of the little boy's mother. Once he arrives at the party, Peter quickly discovers that the little boy's newly-broken family dynamic has taken its toll. Peter and the mother must work together in order to save the little boy from walking into a strip club he thinks is Never-Neverland. In the end, Peter's self confidence is restored through helping others.
