The Wild Frontier

 Outlaws are in control of the land so the town of Clayton City writes the governor for an honest marshal. That marshal is Frank Lane, who brings his son Rocky with him. They are attacked on the way to town by bandits, but Jimmy arrives in time to drive them off. In town, Marshal Lane figures that Saddles is the man behind the outlaw gang, but Saddles kills Lane before he can jail him. With no witnesses, they blame Nugget for the killing and Jimmy is gunning for him. Rocky decides to use the insurance money as bait to smoke out the outlaws and the head man.
