 Pekka and Minna are a young couple who lives in the attic of her parents house. Everyday it becomes more and more frustrating for Pekka who therefore decides to build a house of their own. Unfortunately Pekka has no experience of such and neither his father-in-law or the drunken building master are much of a help.
