The Silent Man of Timber Gulch

 One day a stranger comes to a lumber camp called Timber Gulch and settles into an isolated cabin outside the camp, where he keeps to himself and never speaks to anyone. The only reaction anyone ever sees from him is when he hears a gunshot, and then he tracks down the source of the sound and forcibly takes the gun away from its user. One day an elderly man and a young girl arrive at the camp, and the camp boss realizes that the man is an old friend of his he hasn't seen in years. The old man relates a tale to his friend that the boss comes to believe may involve the silent stranger who lives outside the camp.
