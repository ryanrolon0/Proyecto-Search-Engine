Scorched

 New Soth Wales (Australia), 2012. Global warming caused temperatures to rise 2° worldwide. Australia suffers permanent drought. Ever scarcer potable water has become the main contraband. The fire department is the key service coordinating other branches, even the police, in emergencies. Now a storm threatens the vast suburbs of metropolitan state capital Sidey, coordinate David Langmore is given emergency powers. Alas water supply is insufficient, and the fire knocks out the electric power, hence everything else. Even devoted medical and public professionals are distracted by loved ones in urgent danger. A TV reporter is on the trace of a corrupt deal between useless state PM Angela Boardman and the power company.
