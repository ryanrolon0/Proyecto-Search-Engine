The Xlitherman

 Martyn is just like you suburbs; he goes to work and comes home again. Just like you do. But Martyn has a secret. Martyn is obsessed with murder and magic. He admires people like Peter Kurten, Charlie Manson, the night stalker Richard Ramirez. And of course, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Martyn visits notorious locations forever linked with the horrors of the past, particularly Saddleworth Moor where Brady and Hindley tortured, murdered and buried their child-victims. And if you cross him, perhaps he even visits your home while you sleep. Still, everyone has a few secrets, right? Even you. Martyn is no different from you. Things change when Sandra appears - seemingly from nowhere - and Martyn is goaded into revealing his true nature. Now, the suburbs will never be safe again.
