The Girl Writer

 It's late at night. Marion is a comedy sketch writer. She has three sketches due in the morning, and she has come up with nothing. If only she were a guy, she muses, it's so simple for them to come up with ideas. She nods off, and sure enough, she dreams three male fantasy sketches in rapid succession. Still napping, she has a woman's dream - and then a rude awakening.
