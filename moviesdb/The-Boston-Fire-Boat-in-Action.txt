The Boston Fire Boat in Action

 This film shows the fire boat coming head on to the camera. All of the nozzles are in full play, and the effect of the columns of water rising from the bow of the boat is grand. The action of the wind causes the columns to spray out until they look like huge bunches of ostrich feathers blowing in the wind. We were enabled to take this picture through the kind courtesy of Mr. L. Webber Chief of the Boston Fire Department, who executed to us all the assistance in his power.
