Up on the Housetop

 Curtis Calhoun just isn't in the mood for Christmas and wishes it would all go away. It appears he gets his wish, at least until he finds a strange little man in a red suit stuck in his chimney on Christmas Eve. Is it a cat burglar in disguise, or is it really Santa Claus with a very special Christmas gift for the discouraged Curtis Calhoun?
