The Search for Oxygen3D

 The Search For Oxygen3D is a motion graphic visual dissertation incorporating photography, model making, digital effects and music.Its inspiration comes from my ideas about the lengths that humans go to when trying to find pure air, away from the Planets smog filled cities. I suppose the film is a statement about how our surrounding environment effects the quality of our lives and how places like this can help people to meditate on inner calmness to achieve a better quality of living. My inspiration came from my own search for pure air and love for hill walking on the Burren National Heritage Park, County Clare, Ireland. A unique place where states of meditation, peacefulness and tranquility can be found.
