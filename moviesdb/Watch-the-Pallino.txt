Watch the Pallino

 In the 1900s immigrants were drawn to the promise of steady work in the coalmines of rural towns like Toluca, Illinois. Bocce was Toluca's favorite pasttime--and today, the town hosts one of the U.S.' largest, most raucous bocce tournaments. Watch the Pallino gives a lively, unabashed glimpse of this event and its history.
