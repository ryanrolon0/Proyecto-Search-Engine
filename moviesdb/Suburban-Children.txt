Suburban Children

 Lily is an angst-driven, sexually obsessed teen in similarity with her friends Lynn and Mandy. Disregarding the advice of her sister Shelly, Lily continues to date and have vigorous sex with the conceited Julian. However, Lily soon discovers that the condoms that they have used have failed to hold up to their labeled promises. Luke has placed himself in a conundrum between his current girlfriend Sherri and her best friend Brittany. All stories converge at an evening party at the house of the sagely drug dealer Lee. As the party continues on, these seemingly care-free teens engage each other in aggressive and shocking confrontations.
