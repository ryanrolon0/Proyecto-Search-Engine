The Adventures of O-Girl Trapped in Time

 O-girl matches wits with the evil Hypnotika who plans to rule the world with the Fetish of Sultar - a rare artifact that she uses to put people under her hypnotic spell. Supported by the equally evil Trance, Hypnotika soon has O-girl right where she wants her - struggling for her very survival.
