Should Husbands Marry?

 Hugh Herbert's wife becomes suspicious when Hugh has to spend a lot of time away from home at conventions, but Hugh allays her concerns. He invites his boss and his wife for dinner, which, he hopes, will lead to a pay-raise for him. A loud, practical-joking friend shows up, with his flashy, redheaded girlfriend, and Hugh ends up in hot water and his boss fires him. He is rehired as a partner, however, when the friend places a large order with Hugh.
