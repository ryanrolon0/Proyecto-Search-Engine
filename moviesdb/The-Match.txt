The Match

 Romance is in the air! Springtime in Maplefield is the perfect season for love, unless you don't know what love really feels like. Winston Suffrage has been on an endless quest to find his soul mate, a girl eccentric enough to fit in with his quirky family but conventional enough to avoid the ire of old-fashioned Maplefield. Sensing their son's growing anxiety, Winston's mother tries to set him up with the "perfect" girl, but the meeting turns out to be a disaster. After the failed attempt, his father sends Winston to a local matchmaker where he is set up with the lovely Harriet Parker Brown, a brunette beauty with soft, blue eyes and a refined English accent. They instantly connect and Winston thinks that he has finally found his perfect match! The only problem is that while Harriet is truly smitten with Winston, she is hiding secrets about herself, including her job as a hooker. Unfortunately, her risquE occupation is no secret to Maplefield's barbershop quartet, the town's tyrannical moral police and arbiters of traditional values. As the quartet tries to confront an oblivious Winston about his choice in women, he and Harriet begin to fall in love. They manage to stave off the increasingly aggressive quartet until a meeting with Winston's parents forces secrets to be revealed.
