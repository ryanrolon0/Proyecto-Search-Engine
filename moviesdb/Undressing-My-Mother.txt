Undressing My Mother

 Ken Wardrop's mother, a farmer's wife for 44 years, takes off her clothes and talks about her body as the camera looks closely at her bottom, her breasts, her tummy, and her face. Meditations on gaining weight because she's relaxed and happy and talking about how much she liked to have her back scratched give way to memories of her husband and the feelings of loss. Her body is a map of childbirth, happiness, love, and loneliness.
