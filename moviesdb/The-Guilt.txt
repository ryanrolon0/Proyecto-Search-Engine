The Guilt

 U.S. Marine David Paxson is a two time combat veteran whose toughest mission occurred thousands of miles away from the battlefield. In 2005, after his friend was killed in Iraq, SSgt Paxson was asked to escort the Marine's flag draped casket home. It was a task that has haunted Paxson. Five years later, two of his fellow Marines fly to Philadelphia to help Paxson find closure and to urge him to seek help. The Guilt is a short documentary that examines survivor's guilt. It is a movie about redemption, readjustment, and friendship. The Guilt shows that war doesn't end on the battlefield.
