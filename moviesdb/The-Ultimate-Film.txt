The Ultimate Film

 John Cleese presents this countdown of the top 100 films based on actual ticket sales in the UK. The list was compiled by the British Film Institute and recognises 'bums on seats' rather than money taken. Each film is accompanied by clips and/or new interviews with many of the cast and crew involved, and the programme also features rare footage and behin-the-scenes clips.
