The Burden Carriers

 Five mythic humans, representing different types of burdens, time, technology, spirituality, food and violence, arise and greet the sun. The Burden Carriers walk into the city stopping only to collect the burdens of people. Their past, their post consumer waste, their burdens as they move on. Only an unseen force, a force that draws them to a predestined house, drives the Burden Carriers. The homeowners arriving home can only call the authorities. The authorities arrive and take the Burden Carriers away, leaving the burdens. The next morning the burdens disappear. The family exits the home only to find they are now the new Burden Carriers.
