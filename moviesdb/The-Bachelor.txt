The Bachelor

 Jason Mesnick and Molly Malaney, the first "Bachelor" couple to ever walk down the aisle, will share their wedding in this special. The couple, who announced their engagement in October, will televise the festivities leading up to the wedding - from Molly's dress fitting to Jason and Molly planning the big day with their wedding planner and event designer. Then it's on to their bachelor and bachelorette parties, and the wedding ceremony.
