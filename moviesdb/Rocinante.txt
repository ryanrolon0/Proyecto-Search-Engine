Rocinante

 England, mid-1980s England, breaking into country houses, taking photos of anything that interests him, until he meets a mysterious woman in a van, who seems to be on the run from the authorities. Set in the aftermath of the 1984-85 miners' strike, the watershed political event of Thatcherite Britain, this film combines the paranoia of the time with a remarkable visual beauty and poetic feeling.
