Trimming Pablo

 A November day in Cold War Britain. And Spanish Communist party member Pablo Picasso steps off the train to attend the 1950 Sheffield World Peace Congress. A disastrous day for the British Peace movement as the conference is called to a halt by a fearful Government. But Picasso's visit will go on to touch the lives of many. One man in particular - the Sheffield barber who cuts Picasso's hair - will carry the memory of his encounter forever. Paul Freeman stars as Picasso in this fascinating and poetic new drama inspired by real events. Stunningly lit and filmed in black and white by cinematographer Mike Fox BSC. Produced and directed by Tim Newton, the film also stars Marc Berman, Jeff Rawle and Colin Stinton..
