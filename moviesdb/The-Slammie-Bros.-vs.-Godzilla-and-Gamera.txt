The Slammie Bros. vs. Godzilla and Gamera

 Godzilla, played by a guy in a cartoonish dragon suit with a blowtorch, and Gamera, played by a guy in a decorated football uniform, are laying waste to cardboard buildings in Tokyo. The Slammie Bros. see the report fall into a TV newscaster's hands, who tells of the incident in simulated bad dubbing, as all the speak. The Slammie Bros. grow to enormous size and fight off Godzilla and Gamera.
