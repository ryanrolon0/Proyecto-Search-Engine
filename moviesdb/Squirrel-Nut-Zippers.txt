Squirrel Nut Zippers

 Since the release of their debut album, "The Inevitable," in early 1995, The Squirrel Nut Zippers have started a glorious craze across our country with their revivification of "hot" jazz, swing, ragtime and Dixieland sounds of the 1920s and '30s, offering a fun, unpretentious alternative to contemporary music. Call them a novelty act if you must, but they've hit upon a formula that transcends genres and generations. While the Zippers were on tour promoting "The Inevitable," filmmaker Clay Walker approached the band about doing a creative project. They agreed and Walker followed the group for the next 9 months conducting interviews with each member in and around Chapel Hill, NC. Walker also captured on video some of their very best early national live performances in North & South Carolina, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco
