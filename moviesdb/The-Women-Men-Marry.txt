The Women Men Marry

 Bill is a reporter who works with Jane, his gal before he married Claire. After a year, he is still crazy in love with Claire. But Claire has been stepping out and is now going with Wiley, Bill's boss. Wiley puts Bill on the morgue detail, so that he can go out with Claire, and Bill finds out something about a story Wiley has already turned down. Wiley then sends Bill and Jane into the cult of Brother Nameless to give him more time with Claire. Bill can find that Brother Nameless is a scam artist, but he cannot see what is going on in front of him.
