Toward the New Education

 The story of Sant Bani, a small, independent and uniquely grounded school. Hidden away in the hills of New Hampshire, this promotional film takes an intimate, personal approach to sharing the atmosphere and the wisdom accrued by the tight community from nearly thirty years of renowned education to K-12 students.
