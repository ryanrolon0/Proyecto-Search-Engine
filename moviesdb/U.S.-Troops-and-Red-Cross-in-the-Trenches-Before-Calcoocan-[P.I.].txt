U.S. Troops and Red Cross in the Trenches Before Calcoocan [P.I.]

 "After driving the Filipinos out of the trenches our troops, after firing one or two volleys, press forward. The enemy returns the fire and the forward rush is marked by a trail of dead and wounded. Following close behind comes hospital corps. Stretchers are quickly brought out and the nurses tenderly care for the fallen and carry them to the rear."
