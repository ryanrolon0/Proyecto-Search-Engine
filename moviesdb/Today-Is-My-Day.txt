Today Is My Day

 it's a story about Paul, a homeless man selling The Motz (a street newspaper designed to help the needy), who by chance meets Susanna. Paul stutters, is shy and fails miserably in his attempts to sell his newspapers. Susanna lives a lonely, isolated life and hates her job in a Call-Center. Instead of changing her circumstances, Susanna prefers to dream herself into a fantasy world. In this short moment where their paths cross, they discover that music is a passion they share. This chance encounter serves as the catalyst that shiftes their lives into a new direction. Not a music film, rather a film about the love of music and humanity.
