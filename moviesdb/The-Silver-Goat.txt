The Silver Goat

 A once famous stage actress and daughter of the World-renowned playwright, Sir Rowland Brass has given up on acting. But when she develops a relationship with an ambitious American playwright living in London, and ultimately marries him, he gradually coerces her back on stage. It is by returning to the stage that she finds herself caught in a manipulative game where she doesn't know who to believe who is a plain old nobody, or no one altogether.
