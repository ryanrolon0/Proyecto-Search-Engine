Tom Toal

 TOM Toal knows what it is like to be left on the scrapheap. The 23-year-old has had an emotional roller-coaster of a year after he was dumped by his childhood sweetheart. Now the stand-up comedian is taking the story of how he is rebuilding his life to the stage. Full of hilarious tales of lads' holidays in Magaluf and disastrous blind dates, the show is a reflection on Tom's first experience of life as a single man. He pins his hopes on lonely hearts ads, spends his nights at karaoke bars and writes desperate love letters to newly-single celebrities as he copes with losing "the one". It is a show about life, love and moving on that will strike a chord with anyone who has ever lost the love of their life.
