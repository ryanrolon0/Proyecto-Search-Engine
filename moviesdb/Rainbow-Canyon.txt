Rainbow Canyon

 This entry in the FitzPatrick Traveltalks zooms in on Nevada's famous Rainbow Canyon (singular canyon). Mr. FitzPatrick shows the former home of the Pioneer and Indian as it was in 1935, with all the splendor of the rugged gorges, mountain peaks, and the rock formations chiseled by nature thousands of years ago.
