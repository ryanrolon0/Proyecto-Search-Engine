Third World America

 For years we've dealt with homelessness by looking the other way or calling the police. Tent City Sacramento exposed the third world conditions right here in America and changed all that. Award-winning filmmaker Costa Mantis moved into tent city with his camera and lived with the homeless for six months, giving them a voice. We've looked the other way for far too long. 'Third World America' will change your life.
