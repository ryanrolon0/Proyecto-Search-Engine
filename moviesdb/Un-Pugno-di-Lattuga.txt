Un Pugno di Lattuga

 It's a seed of vengeance. It's a tale of vegetative proportions. From Justice Productions (PassionS of the Christ, Misfortune by Fortune) comes a film you won't be able to refuse. When farm owner Jeannie Mandanda (Amanda Damron) refuses to turn her property over to the local mob at the hands of her bought brother (Owen Jones), she is sent a shredded message. It is then that she decides to take the (s)law in to her own hands. But can she turn down the fruit of temptation when it is offered to her?
