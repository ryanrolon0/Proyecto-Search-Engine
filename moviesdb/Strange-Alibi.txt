Strange Alibi

 A gambler comes into town to testify before the grand jury. He is killed by the mob before he can testify. Joe Geary (Kennedy) is fired from the police force for being soft on crime. This is a setup between him and the Police Chief so that Geary can infiltrate the gangsters. Geary then goes to prison when the police chief is killed. Geary escapes from prison and with the governor's help proves he is innocent and cleans up the mob.
