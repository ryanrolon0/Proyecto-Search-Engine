The Best Years of Our Lives

 Return to school where hope collides with the inflexible didactic tradition of indoctrination by annihilation. In the long tradition of senior student films that recast personal history as an ambivalent farewell, 'Best Years' sees this reality as both comedy and tragedy. Filmed at a medical school, in 1975, the story is a fictional but emotionally accurate account of growth through adversity. Although the story embraces the proposition that 'change is for the best' the final scenes leave this, at best, as an ambiguous possibility.
