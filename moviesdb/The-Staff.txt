The Staff

 A musical creation about the celebration of life living in a ski town. While the mass work to enjoy the joys of a weekend, the people of a ski town mix them into a sweet, sweet cocktail of life. When they're skiing to work; the tourist is mid way between their 16 hour travel time...all both in search of the deep snow, hot tubs and adventurous sex life.
