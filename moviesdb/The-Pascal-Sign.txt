The Pascal Sign

 Six months ago, a phenomenon of international proportions now known as The Pascal Sign presented to the world an outline of its final days, with November 17th denoted as the day the earth would end. While some believe the prediction and others are more skeptical, the effects of the Pascal Sign have touched the lives of every member of the human race. Five such stories are explored in Director Joe Weil's third feature film, which explores the issues of happiness, redemption, faith, love, and friendship all framed against the background of the final days of our lives. As stories unravel of a musician, a murderer, an outsider, a future priest, and two visceral opportunists, all are forced to answer the question - how does one choose to spend the end of time?
