The Donkey Party

 Shows a large picture of a donkey hanging on the wall in a parlor. Five pretty girls and Grandma participate in the game. Each player in turn, while blindfolded, endeavors to attach the donkey's tail in its proper place. All the girls place the tail in the wrong place, but Grandma, who is only partially blindfolded, locates the tail in the proper place. As soon as the tail is fastened the donkey begins kicking, and strikes Grandma in the chest, knocking her down.
