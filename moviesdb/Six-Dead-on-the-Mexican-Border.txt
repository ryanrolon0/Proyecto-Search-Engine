Six Dead on the Mexican Border

 An SUV carrying 20 illegal immigrants fled from a police car along the US-Mexico border. Minutes later, the wrecked SUV and the bodies of six people, all Mexican citizens, were recovered from an irrigation canal a few miles away. A 15-year-old boy, Alejandro Toribio-Gama, was arrested and charged with six counts of murder for allegedly driving the vehicle. If convicted, he faces life in prison. With unprecedented access to Gama, an admitted member of an alien smuggling organization, this is the story of one boy's journey from an impoverished farming village in Mexico to the violent northern border, where tensions between smugglers and the U.S. Border Patrol have made it a deadly risk for migrants and their paid 'coyotes'.
