Sairandhri

 This mythological film tells the "Mahabharata" story of the villainous Keechak's lusting after Sairandhri, the persona adopted by Draupadi in her 13th year of exile. As a maid who is supposed to be Swarastika, she claims the protection of King Veerat. Keechak with the covert complicity of sister Sudeshna, attacks the heroine and, after a spectacular chase through King Veerat's court, he is gorily beheaded by Bheema.
