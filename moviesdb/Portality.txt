Portality

 Portality is a meditation of a place neither inside nor outside created through passage and connection. The film utilizes the idea of mnemonic devices and the art of memory as the threshold into the imagination. It explores the deception of perspective, paranoia, and space. Through rudimentary distortion, reminiscent of childlike perception, the film initiates instinctive reactions of the disoriented in the face of the unknown.
