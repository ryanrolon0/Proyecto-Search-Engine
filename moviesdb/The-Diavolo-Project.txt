The Diavolo Project

 Eight teaching artists from Nebraska take part in a dance intensive with Jacques Heim, founder and artistic director of the dance company Diavolo. Traveling to the Diavolo studio in Los Angeles, the teaching artists learn the Diavolo technique. Under the intense pressure of only a week to pull together a performance, and the added pressure of creativity and personality clashes, they form new bonds. As an ensemble they collaborate to create new artistic interpretations of movement and dance. Glowing from their performance, the teaching artists travel across Nebraska, where they bring the Diavolo technique and the idea of movement as expression to various communities, while instilling the core values of Diavolo - trust, sacrifice and commitment.
