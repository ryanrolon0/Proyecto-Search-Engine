The Street Cleaner

 Prostitutes are disappearing from Savannah, Georgia's Historic District. As police hunt for a suspected serial killer, the local media fuels the city's fear. We follow Jamie, a heroin-addicted young streetwalker, through her abduction, isolation, and eventual fate. The plot was inspired by a true serial killer case the director, Nathaniel Nauert, followed while shooting for the FOX News station in Boston, Massachusetts. Street-walking, drug-addicted prostitutes from Worcester, Massachusetts were being abducted. For a long time they were just missing, but eventually their bodies were discovered (some of them, anyway) as far away as Maine. Nathaniel took that story and began researching and playing, "What if."
