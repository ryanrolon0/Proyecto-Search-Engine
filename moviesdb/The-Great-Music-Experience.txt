The Great Music Experience

 "The Great Music Experience", produced by Tony Hollingsworth of Tribute and backed by UNESCO and the United Nations, was staged at Todai Ji, an eighth-century Buddhist temple, the world's largest wooden building containing the world's largest statue of Buddha. It challenged top international artists to immerse themselves in Japanese culture, explore their differences and perform a show that was rich in its influence.
