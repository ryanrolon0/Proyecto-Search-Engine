Pueblo Pluto

 Mickey goes into a souvenir shop out west and leaves Pluto with a buffalo bone to chew on. A small dog comes to take it away and runs into a ring of cactus with it; Pluto is too big to enter the same way, so he comes in from above and finds himself stuck inside until the small dog helps.
