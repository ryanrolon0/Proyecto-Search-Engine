The Policy Girl

 Dancer Jeannie James is a headliner at a New York club. Her brother sells insurance and wants help meeting Al Potts, a radio comic in line for a million dollar policy. Jeanne volunteers to make the sale, arranging to meet Al at his favorite watering hole. At the same time that she goes to work on sales, she falls for one of Al's friends while her pal Mabel sets her eyes on Al's radio-show partner, Jack Saunders. Business and pleasure mix well, and, as the plot moves, Jeanne, Al, and Jack get in several song and dance numbers.
