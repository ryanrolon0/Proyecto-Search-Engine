The Chosen

 400 years ago there was a great war, only The Chosen survived. The Chosen are the last living people on earth. They survived the deadly conflict because of their faithful dedicated to their god Sirk. In their most sacred of traditions the Head Elder must choose two teenage girls each year to be trained, educated and become part of the community elite. This is the only way they will be accepted by Sirk and join him in his great palace; becoming goddesses of their own. But only when the head Elder of the town selects his own daughter, Alice; Alice's grandfather, Samuel, must stop the tradition he spent his life protecting.
