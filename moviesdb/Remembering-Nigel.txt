Remembering Nigel

 A group of people get together to remember a man they once knew named Nigel. Unfortunately everyone's opinion of this man is so vastly different you soon realize nobody knew the poor bloke at all! In a series of flashback scenes from everyone's point of view we piece together a life lived to the full. A funny, sad and finally triumphant life that makes us realize that there's a little Nigel in us all.
