S.K.I.N.S.

 From award-winning filmmaker Anthony Spadaccini comes S.K.I.N.S., the companion to the Head Case series. S.K.I.N.S. stands for 'Serial Killers In Need of Support' - an underground network of the Delaware Valley's most dangerous serial killers. Once a week, they meet - to support, encourage, and educate one another. S.K.I.N.S. tells the story of this sadistic band of murderers, through uncut footage shot at these meetings from 2006 to 2007, supplemented by personal home movies, TV interviews, and police interrogation videos of the group's members. This footage, compiled by authorities, answers many questions about the group and those connected to it.
