The Language of Spirituality

 Do the languages and cosmologies of Native Americans hold the keys to the mysteries of quantum physics and the nature of reality? That is the intriguing premise of The Language of Spirituality, a documentary film about the intersection of spirituality, modern science and language. Inspired by an annual gathering of western physicists, linguists and Native elders and scholars in Albuquerque, New Mexico, "The Language of Spirituality" traces the convergence of the theories of linguist Benjamin Whorf and renowned theoretical physicist David Bohm, and the cosmology of Native America. The film includes interviews with linguist Dan "Moonhawk" Alford, Blackfoot scholar Leroy LIttle Bear, theoretical physicist F. David Peat, a colleague of Bohm, and author Fred Alan Wolf of "What the Bleep Do We Know" fame.
