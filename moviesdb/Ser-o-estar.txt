Ser o estar

 After his hallucinations cause problems in the U.S., Andy sets out to become immersed in the culture of a small Spanish town. Starting a new life in the birthplace of Miguel de Cervantes, who created the greatest dreamer to ever occupy our imaginations, Don Quixote de la Mancha, Andy soon finds that his new group of friends won't provide an escape from the traps of his mind and that living up to the myth of the great knight proves to be a greater challenge than he had thought. As the title suggests, Andy must battle his own giant windmills, go on modern adventures, and navigate the ways of Spanish women to find a way to be... or to be.
