The Clockmaker's Dog

 The clockmaker's dog runs off to join the school that trains the famous St. Bernard rescue dogs in the Swiss Alps, but he is rejected. Meanwhile, the clockmaker goes searching for his pet and is lost. His dog finds him in an unorthodox way. He is rewarded for his work and returns to his master's home to bask in glory while the clockmaker makes a clock commemorating the event.
