The Clear Road Ahead

 THE CLEAR ROAD AHEAD is an epic short about rebirth. We watch a man prepare notes for an important presentation in a small hotel, its cafeteria, and inside his car. When the presentation goes wrong he drives away in disgust, cursing, accelerating, yawning. He crashes and his life begins anew. He awakes in a forest, pinned high up in a tree. He falls to earth. His car bursts into flames. He falls in a river and ascends from the wood, seeing a pregnant horse. Soon there is a foal and, as the sun rises, he finds some sort of communion with these two creatures. In the milky morning light, shown of his possessions, dirty, wet and half naked, he walks off towards a new day.
