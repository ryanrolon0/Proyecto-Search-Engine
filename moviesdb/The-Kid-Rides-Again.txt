The Kid Rides Again

 Billy breaks jail in Texas and travels to Sundown at the request of his friend Fuzzy. There he runs into Mort Slade who is after a mortgage held by banker Ainsley. Slade's men rob the bank and then incite a run on the bank knowing Ainsley does not have enough money. A gang of outlaws in Sundown, led by Mort Slade, have been raiding the ranches and rustling cattle, trying to drive down property values and then buy or takeover the ranches. Fuzzy Jones sends for his pal, Billy the Kid, who has been arrested, on a frame-up charge of robbing the express, by a crooked sheriff in Texas working in collusion with Slade's gang in New Mexico. Billy breaks jail and rides to the rescue.
