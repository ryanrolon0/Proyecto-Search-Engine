Unholy Ground

 Unholy Ground is a deeply affecting film about the impact of civil war on the lives of villagers living on the front line. Set in eastern Sri Lanka, the film follows six survivors of a massacre by the Tamil Tigers, in which 54 people were killed, including twelve children. Filmed in the Sinhalese Buddhist village of Gonagala seven years after the massacre, Unholy Ground is a powerful testimony not only to the enduring effects of war, but also to the capacity for survival and healing. The film captures the stunning beauty and enduring heartbreak of this island nation, deeply divided by more than 25 years of armed conflict.
