The Dreamer

 Awaiting his death in a 'Nirvana' recycling plant, one clone's desire for a glimpse of what it is to be human becomes a reality when he escapes his executioners and goes on the run. Along his short but thought provoking mini odyssey, he experiences the full gamut of human emotions before he is finally hunted down by his capturers/creators.
