The Adventures of Big Handsome Guy and His Little Friend

 The Adventures of Big Handsome Guy and His Little Friend is the short film that boldly exposes a growing worldwide epidemic friendship. Buddy Little is a timid 5'4" nerd who always seems to come up short. His unlikely best friend is Guy Hansen - a charming, overgrown jock who lives a carefree existence of one night stands and two-for-one drink specials. When this not-so-dynamic duo sets out for a night on the town, a familiar pattern emerges horribly wrong for Buddy. But this night is not like all other nights. This is the night that finally pushes Buddy over the edge and forces him to make the surprising and hilarious self-discovery that has eluded him his entire life.
