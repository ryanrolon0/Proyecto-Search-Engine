The Haunted Valley

 A lady rancher borrows a million dollars from the bank to build a dam to irrigate Haunted Valley. The contract specifies that if she doesn't get the dam finished and pay back the loan in three months, the bank would get her ranch, the dam and the entire valley. The banker intends to make sure that she doesn't finish the dam. Ruth, the owner of Haunted Valley, borrows a million dollars in order to finish a dam. The terms of the loan specify that if she doesn't pay it back in three months she will lose both Lost River Dam and Haunted Valley.
