The S.I.N.

 Against the backdrop of the race for mayor of Las Vegas, a mad bomber is on the loose and his target is Pacific Cargo Shipping. The company hires expert and world-renowned P.I., Bud Chelzer, to investigate the latest bombing in Las Vegas, NV. At the same time, Brad Morrison, a recently fired singer/comedian, has just been approached by a sexy and mysterious woman who promises big bucks if he joins her and her group but she is sketchy on the details. He needs the money and accepts. With Bud Chelzer helping him out in a pinch, the two get caught up in a behind-the-scenes caper that, if the lid blows, could expose the biggest scandal in Las Vegas history.
