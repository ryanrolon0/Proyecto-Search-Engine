The Hollywood Beach Murders

 After fatally shooting a suspect in the killing of a mobster's wife, two policemen are dispatched cross-country to return the accused in another case. One's adversity to flying, however, results in a missed plane and a train trip, instead. On board is a second kingpin and his entourage, in which a wife is murdered similarly to the homicide which preceded this journey.
