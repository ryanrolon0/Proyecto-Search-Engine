Thanksgivin', die nachtblaue Stadt

 Awkward, passive and lacking in any kind of experience, Mikky stumbles from one precarious situation to the next. He is threatened and blackmailed. He flees to another man's bed, but that too ends disastrously. He is almost beaten to death by a "crazy woman". After that, he is suspected of murder and thrown in jail. The only person who can help him now is Veronika, a toilet cleaner who is also in danger of being consumed by her fate.
