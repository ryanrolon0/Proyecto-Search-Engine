Stuntwood

 A fast-paced documentary, STUNTWOOD takes a comprehensive look at skateboarding through the journey of the skateboard itself. From the maple forests of the Great Lakes Region to the urban streets where skateboards thrive, STUNTWOOD follows the wood through factories and the processes of becoming a skateboard and delves into how the board profoundly affects people, art, and public spaces. Feeding a multi-billion dollar international industry, the skateboard has created a fast-growing sub-culture that has become mainstream while still staying true to its fiercely personal, independent, and creative roots. This unique documentary celebrates the wood and the culture that surrounds it.
