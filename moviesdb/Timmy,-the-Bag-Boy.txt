Timmy, the Bag Boy

 Timmy, a seven year old boy who wears decorative paper bags on his head, is taken to a local child therapist by his parents. In the waiting room of the medical center, he meets an older man whose own head is completely wrapped in bandages. The two masked men develop a bond that only they seem to understand.
