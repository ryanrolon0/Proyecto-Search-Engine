The Last Rose

 Two strangers seeking to buy a luxury apartment meet by accident. Teresa is a lonely young woman looking for love. Michael is a middle-aged man looking for an escape from his painful love life, or lack of it. Teresa and Michael embark on a series of romantic and sexual escapes that become increasingly physical and confrontational as they are brought face to face with the pain they both are trying to get away from.
