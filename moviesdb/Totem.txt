Totem

 Autumn Chance sets off an apocalyptic series of events when she asks her husband Jackson and his longtime pal, William Nerowe, to plant a mysterious Totem Pole. Unaware of its origins, Jackson and Nerowe inadvertently activate the Totem's power and are marked for death by a treacherous angel named Azrael Seraphim. Seeing that the gateway between the natural and the supernatural world has become open, Autumn chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice for love. Hoping it will give Jackson the time he needs to fulfill his destiny, she sacrifices her life to Azrael and is taken into his world. Heartbroken and confused, it is only with the help of Nerowe that Jackson is able to discover a mystical Indian tribe capable of tracking Autumn's spirit and confronting her captor, Azrael. Seeking to thwart our two heroes is the callous and vengeful FBI Agent Samuel Miller. His unreciprocated love for Autumn and lingering suspicion about her death send him on a relentless and blood thirsty pursuit for justice. The three men collide in an epic battle between good and evil that culminates in Azrael's sanctuary, deep in the Valley of Death. It is only in this place that the secret of the Totem can be revealed and the fate of Autumn, Jackson, Nerowe, and Miller decided. Totem is the first of three action-thriller films in the "Chain of Being" trilogy
