Reds & Blues

 Dixie (Paul Duckworth) a fervent, bitter blue has been bin-bagged and arrives at the home of his crazy Evertonian sister, Gwladys (Lindzi Germain). Unbeknown to the blues, the rabid reds next door headed by Kenny (Andrew Schofield) and Anne (Lynn Francis) are planning a European Cup celebration garden party. On finding out, Dixie is hell-bent on ruining the occasion. The ridicule and banter between both families and their kids is endless as the flak is fired from both sides of the dividing fence which becomes a World War 1 no-man's-land trench. Between the onslaught are many cameos from ex red & blue players including Howard Kendall as the Blue Bishop and Ian St John as the Red Saint whilst original songs from Dixie & Gwladys inside the Bitter & Twisted arms, and from Anne and Kenny make this a Red and Blue comedy musical fest. Other Red & blue cameos include, Phil Thompson, Alan Kennedy, John Aldridge, Jimmy Case, Tommy Smith, Mark Ward, Stuart Barlow, Graham Stuart and Derek Mountfield.
