Verlorenwasser 4

 Twenty years after the fall of the Wall, Peter Roloff continues his film series (1990 - 2009) by recounting more stories from the world of Verlorenwasser (Lost Water). Reality is reflected back from an eastern German stream as poetic fiction. Verlorenwasser is a metaphor for the disappearing and reappearance of stories and history in the stream of time. In early 1990, Roloff first visited the stream and village of the same name with its seven houses and immersed himself in a foreign world. He now explores the present condition of this remote forest area of eastern Germany and loses himself amongst the traces of its past. By an irony of fate, the central point of the GDR was located some few meters from the Verlorenwasser stream. This isolated forest was a home to Soviet military, riot police and the Stasi, and the abandoned objects of these bodies exude a cold presence even now. The film maker crosses the woods with inhabitants, friends and strangers. The husband of the local landlady tames a common raven that he finds in the woods. A philosopher resident in Verlorenwasser recently published her book about traces. The forest owner sells wood from Verlorenwasser's woods to China. One of the film maker's friends is a hobby geocacher, and together they hide a cache in Verlorenwasser. Even after three films about Verlorenwasser, this peculiar area doesn't cease to amaze Peter Roloff. The fourth film deploys brief meetings with people, images of strong visual power, and the acoustic hissing of the woods, as well as music playing on both German folk music and the Chinese tonal world to form an associative fabric.
