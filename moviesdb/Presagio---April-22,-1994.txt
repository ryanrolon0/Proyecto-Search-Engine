Presagio - April 22, 1994

 In the urban environment of the '90s, several lives interwire, confronting themselves with the social problems that were beginning to emerge in a world of great disinformation. The main character will be pushed unintectionally into a stream of events which will change his "normal" way of life, forcing him to undergo an analysis that will turn his small world inside out. May a fatal encounter with another person question his whole life style? Andrew knows it.
