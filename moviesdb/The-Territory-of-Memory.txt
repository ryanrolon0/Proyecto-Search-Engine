The Territory of Memory

 A view of family history and turn-of-the-century immigration that is both personal and emblematic. With documentary evidence, a family's passage is traced through Ellis Island in the early 1900s; urban life in Chicago from the 1920s through the 40s; untroubled days in Dayton, Ohio, from post-World War II through the 1950s; and, finally, to a groundbreaking event in February 1964. The Territory of Memory incorporates original video and audio with home movies, family portraits and snapshots from a personal family archive, anonymous found footage, and public domain moving and still images.
