Uña y carne

 Growing up in separate parts of Puerto Rico, two little boys got used to keeping their true feelings hidden; they felt like girls. One was a wild kid smoking pot, skipping classes, and partying. The other kept to herself and quietly focused on getting an education. As young adults they both moved to New York and big city life introduced them to worlds very far apart. Years later, the two women met in a transgender support group in Manhattan and instantly became friends. But as the friendship grew stronger, Michele and Denise were forced to accept an ever-present risk of losing each other.
