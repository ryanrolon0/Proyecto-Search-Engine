Sleazemania III

 This compilation of 23 previews and four ads (including Fox Motor's Jalopy Night) moves from the lurid to the educational to the blue. It opens with its own witty trailer you are past 60 you can't stand it!" Most are for pre-60s movies featuring male voice-overs and cue cards that ask, "How far can a girl go and remain decent?," or promise "Keyhole Intimacy." Several depict men abusing women while the narrator talks about seduction. A few women fight back. One promotes a performance film with an all-Black cast ("Woman's a Fool"). The previews for the more recent B movies show a lot of skin in Eastman color.
