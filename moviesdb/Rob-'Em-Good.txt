Rob 'Em Good

 A two-reel comedy starring Bull Montana as the villainous Earl of Nothingdone, and working hard to get something done about Robemgood before he makes off with the hand and other parts of the fair Lady Merryann Fisswater. The Sherif of Rottingham is useless. And even more so when the Knight of the Cauliflower replaces Nothingdone.
