Wayne Gretzky

 First instructional video from "The Great One." Gretzky travels to the Soviet Union (his paternal grandparents were ethnic Poles from Belarus, then a part of the U.S.S.R), and goes one-on-one with Vladislav Tretiak, considered the greatest goalie who's ever lived. Includes tips from Gretzky's father and first coach, Walter, a profile of Gretzky, and game footage.
