The Inn of Floating Imagery

 This piece represents a kind of autobiographical vision. I use myself to create all the figures, sometimes employing masks from the Noh theater to vary my persona. A sea of richly colored figures floating and flying are accompanied by eerie sounds. The animated figures are constructed in the manner of puppetry and collage. The imagery continues until the artist's involvement with her "canvases" is revealed, with her performative self finally emerging.
