Upside Downtown

 When a stranger wanders into a large metropolitan city for the first time, he finds himself face to face with a homeless man, who will reveal to him some of the darkest secrets the city has to offer. The price for these stories is a mere five dollars. Over the course of a day, the homeless man weaves one urban tale after another, each one a moral mystery where the storyteller himself appears as an innocent bystander. The film is told in the shape of a wheel, with a reward for the viewer and the homeless man at the beginning and end of the film's cycle.
