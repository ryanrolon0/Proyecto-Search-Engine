The Bro Bowl

 The Bro Bowl first free public skate parks built in the late 1970s. Located near housing projects in downtown Tampa, the bro bowl became the centerpiece of an unintended culture clash between suburban kids and locals from nearby neighborhoods. Over time the skateboarding scene at the bro bowl became a proto-typical example of what organizations like The Tony Hawk Foundation are striving to achieve low-income areas. With the bowl's demolition a looming possibility the skateboard community raised its voice in order to preserve the legendary skate park landmark. Will the Bro Bowl survive? Interviews with legendary skateboarding icons Paul Schmitt, Bruce Walker, Christian Hosoi, Lance Mountain, and Buck Smith are combined with the experiences of local & contemporary skateboarders to tell the story. Driven by a soundtrack of local artists and bands from the Tampa/St. Petersburg area, The Bro Bowl 30 Years of Tampa Concrete culminates into an overall expression of the scene, character, and creativity surrounding skateboarding.
