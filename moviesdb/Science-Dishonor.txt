Science Dishonor

 In 1970, Mr. Steve Halitsky discovered original methods for Ill-Defined System Analysis. His work would help in remote recognition of IED; early identification of AIDS / Cancer; verification of airplane engine reliability and modeling of Stock Market. Yet, for 40 years, Mr. Halitsky's advanced discovery is being suppressed by the Science Community.
