Sailing for Madagascar

 In the winter of 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor throws the United States into a turmoil of paranoia and racism. In the midst of it all, young Bette Warren (Aimee Teegarden) is uprooted to Los Angeles with her father, and injured war hero, and her older brother, a young upstart lost in the shadows of his father's military past. Bette quickly finds solace in Scott, the orphaned grandson of her Japanese neighbor. With all the innocence of youth the pair share a common dream of a world untouched by war and hatred. What they could not dream of, is the awful reality that awaits them upon discovery of their friendship, and the inevitable pain of innocence lost.
