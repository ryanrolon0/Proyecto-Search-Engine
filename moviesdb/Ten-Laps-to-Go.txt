Ten Laps to Go

 Larry Evans (Rex Lease), champion race car driver, is envied by his chief rival, Eddie DeSylva (Duncan Renaldo), who has more ambitions than merely winning the races; he has designs on the motor patent held by Corbett (Tom Moore), Larry's employer. Eddie also has a yen for Corbett's daughter, Norma (Muriel Evans), who prefers Larry. Eddie intentionally causes a race wreck that injures Larry and sends him to the hospital. Larry emerges from the hospital and finds his morale and courage has been broken when he falters while chasing some DeSylva henchmen who have robbed Corbett of some blueprints. But he regains his nerve and courage at the race track when he realizes that the driver hired to replace him, Barney Smith (Yakima Canutt), is working for DeSylva with intentions of throwing the race.
