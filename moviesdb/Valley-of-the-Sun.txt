Valley of the Sun

 In 1868, Army scout Johnny Ware is courtmartialed for helping Indians against their white oppressors, but escapes and finds himself in the hamlet of Desert Center. There, he crosses paths with Christine Larson who is about to marry one of the crooked Indian agents...but not if Johnny can help it. The film lapses frequently into comedy, with an action climax as our hero tries to head off an incipient Indian war.
