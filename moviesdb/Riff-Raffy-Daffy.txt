Riff Raffy Daffy

 Patrolman Porky Pig orders vagrant Daffy Duck out of a gopher hole in the City Park. So, Daffy takes up residence near a fireplace inside a closed-for-business department store. When Porky sees Daffy through one of the store's windows, he enters, intending to throw Daffy out. The resulting chase takes them through the store's many departments. No matter where vagabond Daffy Duck goes to sleep, policeman Porky Pig is there to toss him out. Finally, Porky kicks him out the city park entirely, and it starts snowing. Daffy decides to take shelter at the closed Macys department store. When Porky catches him, he's determined to be rid of Daffy once and for all.
