See-Saw Scene

 "Two factory boys get a huge barrel during their noon hour, and with a couple of planks they make an old-fashioned seesaw. Sitting on either end, they go up and down like a pair of kids. 'Long comes a third party with a brim full water pail, and a practical joke. He pushes off the boy nearest him, and substitutes the pail, which being lighter away she goes, with comical results. The dripping boy wipes the water out of his eyes and off his clothes with a good-natured grin, while the other two laugh till their sides ache. Audience joins in every time this picture is shown. A very acceptable subject as a mirth provoker. Figures true to life and distinct."
