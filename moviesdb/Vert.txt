Vert

 Composed of a combination of interviews and archival film footage, the film documents the founding and current tenuous status of the most popular form of active shoreline recreation in the world. Shot with the cooperation of the game's co-founder and his family, the film examines the destructive affects of greed and indifference upon passion, nostalgia, and the innocence of childhood.
