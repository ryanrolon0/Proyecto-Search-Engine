The Ad and the Ego

 Intercutting thousands of contemporary and classic television commercials with insights by Stuart Ewen, Jean Kilbourne, Sut JhalIy and others, this film scrutinizes late 20th century American society and its prime inhabitant, Consumer Man. You will never look at an ad the same way again after viewing what critics are calling "the first comprehensive documentary on the cultural impact of advertising in America".
