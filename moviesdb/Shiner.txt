Shiner

 An elderly, obsessive-compulsive hoarder sits contemplatively on a stretch of sand underneath the Brooklyn Bridge. Along comes a young boy from the projects, whose face bears the telltale signs of physical abuse. The mere sight of the boy immerses the old man in memories of his own childhood, when he too suffered horrible abuse. Nevertheless, by the end of the film these two strangers will have changed each other's lives.
