Sonic Advance

 Sonic Advance combines elements from the original Sonic series on the Sega Genesis, as well as from the Dreamcast Sonic Adventure series. Choose from Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, or Amy and take them through level after level of blindingly fast gameplay and ring collecting, dodging enemies in your path towards the final showdown with Dr Robotnik (aka Dr Eggman). Collect Chaos Emeralds along the way to transform into Super Sonic for added speed, and train your Chao to exchange them into Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Nintendo Gamecube via the link cable. And if that wasn't enough, you can also play 4 player battle modes with your mates, using one game cart between 4 Gameboys.
