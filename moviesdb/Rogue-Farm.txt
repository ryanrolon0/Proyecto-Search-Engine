Rogue Farm

 In the near future, in a remote corner of Scotland, a couple scratch a living from the barren land around their isolated hill farm. Memories of a war that has left the world broken haunt them as they try to lead a normal life. But a remarkable stranger arrives at their lonely outpost and their lives begin to take a shape they couldn't possibly have imagined.
