Undertakings

 Undertakings is a film which depicts the strangely eccentric life of W.F. Lloyd. We follow Lloyd's steady regression into the subconscious-- a regression which forces him to realize the life he reluctantly lives within his dreams. He finds himself sharing his story with a local psychologist. "The dead have been my life," Lloyd explains. However, he has in fact developed a recent fear of corpses. This is quite unfortunate for Lloyd who is (and for the past 25 years has been) an UNDERTAKER. Undertakings is a journey into the darkest place in the human spirit--a place where the conscious meets the subconscious...
