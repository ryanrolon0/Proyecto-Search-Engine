South of No North

 Doc and the Kid hate their jobs as door-to-door bible salesmen. They are outdated men in a modern world, living paycheck to paycheck. After they are cut loose from their jobs they have to escape town with an unpaid motel bill hanging over their heads. The only thing they hate more than their jobs, is paying their debts.
