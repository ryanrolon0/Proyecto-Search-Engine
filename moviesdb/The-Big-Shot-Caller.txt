The Big Shot-Caller

 As a child, Jamie Lesser watched 'Strictly Ballroom' ninety-seven times a day and dreamed of becoming a salsa dancer. But in 'real life', his social awkwardness, failed love life and severe near-sightedness got in his way. After insurmountable disappointments, he turns to his estranged sister, Lianne, a streetwise, self-proclaimed hip hop dancing dynamo, inspires him to follow his dream, reclaim his self-esteem and become what he was truly meant to be.
