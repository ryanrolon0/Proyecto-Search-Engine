Ticking Clocks

 Marianne lives your typical mid 20s life-- she works in a 9-5, flirts with Jake, the cute boy at the office but is too scared to make a move, and ends up at the pub with friends Curtis and Laura-- until her 25th birthday. On this particular birthday, she is visited by a woman who calls herself the Angel of Death. This Angel tells Marianne that she is scheduled to die just before midnight in an unforeseeable accident. Is this alleged angel talking nonsense? Will Marianne survive the night?
