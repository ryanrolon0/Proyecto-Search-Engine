Tombstone

 After success cleaning up Dodge City, Wyatt Earp moves to Tombstone, Arizona, and wishes to get rich in obscurity. He meets his brothers there, as well as his old friend Doc Holliday. A band of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys are causing problems in the region with various acts of random violence, and inevitably come into confrontation with Holliday and the Earps, which leads to a shoot-out at the OK Corral. Former lawman Wyatt Earp, his two brothers and friend Doc Holliday settle in the town of Tombstone in order to lead a profitable and peaceful life but soon come into conflict with the Cowboys, a band of outlaws led by the Clanton brothers. This retelling of the Earp/Clanton feud also follows up the gunfight at the O.K. Corral with a look at the bloody consequences of the showdown. A hollywood historical account of Tombstone, Arizona's famed "Shootout at the O.K. Corral" and the events that led up to it. Tension between "the Law" and "the Cowboys" stirs as the Cowboys, led by "Curly Bill" Broscius, accuse the Earps (Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan) and their outlaw/gambler associate "Doc" Holliday of interefering with their operations inside and outside of town. Wyatt Earp along with his brothers and their wives move to Tombstone to start a new life putting his life as a lawman and gunslinger behind him. Also coming to Tombstone is Wyatt's good friend, Doc Holliday. However, it turns out that "The Cowboys" a group of men, among whose members include The Clantons, pretty much act as if they are above the law. Wyatt would be asked to be Marshall but rejects the offer but his brother, Virgil who can't stomach the violence around him accepts the job over Wyatt's objections. Eventually a confrontation between them and The Cowboys is going to happen. And who will survive?
