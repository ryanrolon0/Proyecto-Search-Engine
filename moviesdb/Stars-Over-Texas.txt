Stars Over Texas

 When Eddie and his pals deliver cattle to the Lawrence ranch, they run into trouble with Ringo Evans and his gang. Ringo's men are rustling cattle and attempting to kill the foreman. Seeing the resemblance between the foreman and his pal Waco, Eddie has Waco impersonate the foreman. They then find proof that Evans is behimd the rustling but find themselves greatly outnumbered when the gang attacks. Riding into town rancher Hank Lawrence and his foreman Bert Ford are fired at from a distance by outlaws "Knuckles," "Bugsy" and Two-Horn." Outriding the gunmen, the two men suspect that they were rustlers. Meanwhile, Eddie Dean, "Soapy" Jones, Waco and four singing cowhands deliver a herd of cattle to the Lawrence ranch and meet Hank's sister Terry who tells them that her brother and the foreman are in town. They meet at a restaurant in town and a striking resemblance between Waco and Bert Ford is noted. Hank tells Eddie about his problem with rustlers and the attempt to ambush them. Eddie agrees to help his old friend and the first step in his plan is for Waco---more than handy with his guns--- to assume the identity of the foreman.
