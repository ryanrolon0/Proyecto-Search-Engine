Spring Rounds

 Two characters are walking through the desert carrying watering pails. One plants a seed and waters it. Soon, a cactus plant spouts. The other chops it down, he who plants another seed and waters it. Up sprouts another plant, which the first character uproots. The two cannot decide on what plant to grow and as such get into a fist fight. But the remorse each feels concerning the argument results in a magical transformation.
