Prague Spring

 Robert and Natalie are a young married couple whose sex life has begun to stagnate. Robert suggests a sexual fantasy. At first she thinks it involves cheerleaders and nurses. To her surprise, he suggests a fantasy based on the Prague Spring Revolution in Czechoslovakia. As they begin to get more and more involved in the fantasy, and he becomes more obsessed, they find it difficult to escape their roles outside of the bedroom.
