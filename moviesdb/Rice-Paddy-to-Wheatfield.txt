 Caodaism is a new religious movement which combines elements of the belief systems of many of the world's religions. Created in 1926 in Vietnam, Caodaism grew to become the third largest religion in Vietnam in only a few decades. Today, there are some three million practicing Caodaists in the world, many who have been spread across the globe as a result of the diaspora following the end of the Vietnamese-American War and the Fall of Saigon in 1975. This documentary film explores Caodaism from its origins in colonial Vietnam to its emergence in the United States; exploring the history, beliefs, rituals and customs of this little-known faith.
