The Real Cliff Richard

 During a career spanning 45 years, Cliff Richard has transformed from sexy rock n' roll star, to Christian entertainer and ultimately into an institution - Britain's most successful solo act. But Cliff has also been dogged by the public's tireless fascination with his continued status as pop's perennial 'Bachelor Boy'. 'The Real Cliff Richard' features rare archive and new interviews with friends, collaborators, girlfriends and critics. It looks at both the highs and lows in Cliff's life and career, and asks if Britain's love affair with the singer is due less to his musical talent than to a fascination with his Peter Pan-like, saintly image? Featuring Bruce Welch and Tony Meehan ('The Shadows'), singers Olivia Newton-John, Paul Jones and Joe Brown etc.
