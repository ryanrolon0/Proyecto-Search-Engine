The Love Letters from Teralba Road

 A violent man (Bryan Brown), who ostensibly has a slight mental illness due to fillings in his teeth, continues to write letters to his estranged girlfriend, Kris McQuade. She sees that he expresses himself more dearly in his letters and he is still quick tempered when they try to rekindle their relationship.
