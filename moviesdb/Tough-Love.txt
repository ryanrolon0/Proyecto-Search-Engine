Tough Love

 This is a semi-autobiographical story of Tina, a Vietnamese woman who seeks freedom in America during the first wave of the "boat people" exodus. During a horrendous month - long journey from Vietnam to Hong Kong in a small, flimsy boat, Tina, her husband and their 6 month old child had to endure tremendous hardships. Their craft, loaded down with 40 refugees, was attacked twice by pirates, who took all their money and belongings. They also managed to survive a violent storm which almost destroyed their craft. Their 6 month old son was not so lucky, however, and died of exposure. Penniless, and devastated by the loss of her son, she makes her way to the west coast of Canada, where she realizes that the "American Dream" is not at all what's it's made out to be. What happens when the American dream turns into a nightmare?
