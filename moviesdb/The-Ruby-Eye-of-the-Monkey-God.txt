The Ruby Eye of the Monkey-God

 A temple guard running through the jungle is doing his best to escape the evil wizard, Abu Kadar, and his band of thieves. They stole a ruby from the statue of the monkey god at the Temple of Bashar, and the guard stole it back from them in order to return it. Meanwhile, Sultana the white tiger is painting Little Rajah the elephant for an upcoming parade, as Princess Yasmin, daughter of the Maharajah, and her friend Ali make preparations. The temple guard finds the two adolescents and begs them to help him just as the curse from the ruby turns him into a monkey. Now they must return the ruby to the eye of the statue. But the evil wizard will use all his magical tricks and every underling in his command to get it back.
