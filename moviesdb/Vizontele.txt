Vizontele

 The story takes place in a small town (called Hakkari) in Turkey at the beginning of the 70's. The time has come to bring technology into that small town. The first Television (or called Visiontele by the citizens) arrives and the chaos begins. Some people are excited and some are afraid of this new device which can show us live pictures from different places. Is it devils easy prey to catch us or is it just a feature of the modern time? Without losing time, the mayor (Altan Erkekli) of the town Hakkari tries to find some people who can help him to set up the signal receiver on the highest position of the mountain. His Team consists of one crazy electrician called Emin (Yilmaz Erdogan) and some mayor office staff members and none of them has any knowledge of TVs. These predecessors of time tried their luck which are mixed up with some traditional superstitions to show how funny the conflict between these two points can be. But also with a dramatical point of view. The storyline of Viziontele is based on the memories of the Dircetor Yilmaz Erdogan, where he grew up in Hakkari while he was a little child.
