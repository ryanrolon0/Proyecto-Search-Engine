Sebastian

 The film which I have submitted is titled Sebastian and examines the symbolic evolution of the Christian icon of Saint Sebastian. The film centers around an exotic dancer named Sebastian who performs for an anonymous and affluent fan that monopolizes his time and dominates his life. This fan is a representation of Diocletian the Roman emperor responsible for decreeing the historical Sebastian's death sentence. During the film Sebastian unties himself from the bonds of Diocletian's infatuation by poisoning the domineering devotee.
