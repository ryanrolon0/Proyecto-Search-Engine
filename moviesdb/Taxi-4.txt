Taxi 4

 Unlucky, clumsy, charming Marseile PD detective Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec must assist worse-then-Clouseau commissioner Gibert guarding a Belgian criminal reputed as dangerous as - and caged like Hannibal Lector. Émilien's cool friend, taxi driver Daniel Morales, initially only agrees to babysit both their buddy-sons, as Émilien's wife Petra is away on top-secret mission. But soon the Belgian escapes, and while chasing him the mates stumble on a bank robbery and a drug king's palatial villa, where the grand finale reeks havoc.
