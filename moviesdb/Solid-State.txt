Solid State

 A sharp and swift spin on the classic cautionary tale, solid state is compelling, captivating, picturesque and poignant. Witness snapshots of three journeys on life's road. Melissa has been offered a new job out of town and struggles to navigate her way either with or away from her long-term partner Justin. Charles awkwardly summons a speck of courage while taking his estranged son Max home from school. Will wonders what life is beyond the roadside town he calls home. Acutely aware of what stands to be gained or lost, everyone must face a critical decision with a potentially permanent outcome. Decision time is now.
