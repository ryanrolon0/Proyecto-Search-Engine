The Fifth Mafia

 Sal Lucido is a banker and he prides himself in not being a part of the Mafia. After all, his uncle Dominic runs the west coast operations of La Cosa Nostra, while his cousin Andy cooks the books. But Sal discovers a dark secret, sending him on a path of revenge as he forms La Stidda - a Fifth Mafia. Mark Harris has a wife, two children, and a growing business as an International financial consultant. Tragically, he loses it all. In an attempt to turn his life around, he becomes a special agent for the FBI. Through high tech bank fraud, the Fifth Mafia steals hundreds of millions of dollars at will - sending La Cosa Nostra and the FBI to Guatemala City in search of Sal. Who will find him first?
