The Memphis Belle

 For almost 60 years the B-17 bomber, the Memphis Belle, called Memphis, Tennessee home. In Oct. 2005, The U.S. Air Force removed one of the most famous aircraft in the world from the possession of the City of Memphis because of the lack of public support. This is the story of 60 years of neglect, apathy and disinterest by the City of Memphis to one of it's most important icons. A documentary film that focuses on the history of the Belle in Memphis and emphasizes the final days and the volunteers who tried to keep another Memphis icon from disappearing.
