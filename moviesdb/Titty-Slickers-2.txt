Titty Slickers 2

 The Stallion Ranch is in danger of foreclosure, so owner Lightening Jack McCoy informs his three ranch hands, Billy Brody, Rory Wright, and Slim Chance, that he plans to convert his spread into "The Best Little Whore House in Pacoima." The only thing he lacks is hookers. But, luck strikes Lightning when a jeep carrying three strippers breaks down on a nearby dirt road.
