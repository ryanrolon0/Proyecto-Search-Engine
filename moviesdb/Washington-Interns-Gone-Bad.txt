Washington Interns Gone Bad

 It's Becky's first day on the job interning for the congressman. After a full day of answering the phone and taking a fake tally of constituents' opinions, she's ready to cut loose and party. But she soon realizes that she's in way over her head when a partisan argument at the party between Elizabeth, the congressman's chief of staff, and some republican interns turns into a rooftop death-match. Between Elizabeth putting her in the line of danger and a kinky congressman devising ways in which to have "sexual relations with that woman," Becky manages to find love, question her beliefs and do the right thing in a classically comedic way with a political twist.
