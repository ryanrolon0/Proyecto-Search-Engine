The Eastern Cowboy

 Jack Richards and Belle Bruce have been engaged for sometime. One day they have a quarrel, which causes Belle to run away. In the meantime, Jack has written her a note, saying that he is going West, which she finds upon her return to the spot where they parted. Arrived in the West, Jack is fortunate enough to secure work on the ranch of Frank Morlin. The ranch owner's daughters, Kate and Jean, are much pleased with the newcomer; and both try to win his love. Belle misses Jack more than ever, and when she receives a letter from her cousins in the West, decides to accept and try to forget her grief in the new environment.
