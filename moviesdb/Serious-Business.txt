Serious Business

 Comedy is serious business. At least that's what pals Brian and Jared discover when they decide to go pro and take their college comedy troupe on the road. On the way, they discover they can survive bad gigs, unreceptive audiences, spotty accommodations and the world's most decrepit van. But can their friendship survive a rivalry over new cast member Kim?
