T.K.L

 Shoal Creek was always known as a safe and friendly place. The residents truly enjoyed its beautiful park and neighborhood bar. Just the kind of place Jeff Johnson, a troubled loner and the new owner of Shoal Creek bar was looking for. However, over the past 8 months things changed. With a string of grisly murders, this once peaceful paradise has suddenly been over taken with trepidation and genuine terror. A serial killer has also made Shoal Creek home. Kristi, an attractive and sometimes extremely flirtation woman, is on a secret rendezvous to meet a friend at Shoal Creek bar. The same bar that happens to be near the site of several unsolved murders. Her presence instantly draws the attention of a number of male clientele. After rejecting their advances and with her friend being a no show, Kristi quickly discovers she's being hunted in a terrifying game of cat and mouse.
