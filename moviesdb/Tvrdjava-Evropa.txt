Tvrdjava Evropa

 Artjom and his daughter Katja try to enter Italy illegally to join their wife and mother, Sveta, who emigrated to Italy a while ago, and found a job with the last of Trieste coachmen driving a horse-driven carriage. Artjom, Katja and a group of other refugees are caught, first by the Slovene and then by the Italian police. The refugees encounter different procedures at police headquarters and are finally placed in a centre for illegal immigrants, awaiting extradition. At the centre, they meet all sorts of refugees and learn about their life stories.
