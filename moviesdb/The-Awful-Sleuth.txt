The Awful Sleuth

 Drug store soda jerk Bert is a true-crime buff who revels in detective magazines. But he doesn't recognize the notorious gangster he waits on, smiling Memphis Mike. Bert innocently sends Mike to his own apartment building, but when he finally recognizes Mike and threatens to have him arrested, Mike and his henchman Pinky hold him captive. Bert escapes onto a high window ledge, with Mike and Pinky gleefully shooting at him, but Bert's bossy mother-in-law claims credit for the crooks' ultimate capture.
