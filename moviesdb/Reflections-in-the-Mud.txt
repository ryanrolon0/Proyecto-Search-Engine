Reflections in the Mud

 Leslee Williams is a photojournalist who, despite international recognition and personal beauty, finds romance less than successful. Her hilarious friend, Ray, encourages her as best he can. A chance meeting with Jonathan Powell, a long-lost high school acquaintance, brings love unpredictably into her life. Everything is going fine until one weekend when Jonathan doesn't return from a "business trip". Leslee then finds herself on a journey where her trust, reporter skills, and personal strength are tested to their limits.
