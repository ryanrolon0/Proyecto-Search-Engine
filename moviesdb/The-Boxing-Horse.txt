The Boxing Horse

 "This sagacious animal created great excitement when on exhibition on the Esplanade of the National Export Exposition at Philadelphia. He represents the highest attainment in the art of training animals, and is looked on as the 20th century wonder. A powerful colored man is his opponent. Each is provided with a set of boxing gloves and they pummel each other all around the ring. The horse scores the only knockdown."
