Spoiler Alert

 Award winning indie film Spoiler Alert (Trail Dance Film Festival "Director's Choice Award") is a black comedy/thriller focusing on the power and temptations of the Internet. Brad, the snarky operator of a movie scoop website, has fun trashing big shot Hollywood director Harrison Kane's work. But when Harrison shows up on his doorstep, things go from funny to bloody. Chinese food, movie geek talk and murder ensue.
