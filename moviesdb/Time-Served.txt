Time Served

 Time is unraveling. In the near future, time travel is reality. In this new world, criminals are made to serve out their sentences in the past. An embezzler, for instance, may be sentenced to live as a destitute in the 1930s so he will understand the financial ruin he brought to other people. But now a master criminal - Truffane - has embarked on a rampage through time, intent on destroying the fabric of humanity by cutting the threads of time itself. Each thread he cuts removes even the memory of a person's existence from the minds of loved ones and friends. If Truffane succeeds, the human race will not be even a memory of a dream, for it will never have been. One man, Simon Tanner, is on a quest to subdue and destroy Truffane. He is the sole surviving member of an elite clandestine force created to bring Truffane to justice. The others have been written out of history. To help him in his quest to defeat Truffane, Simon Tanner is gathering a new group, this time built of misfits and social outcasts. Such a disparate group, he believes, will give him the cover needed to complete his mission. If he fails, all of time is lost. Time is unravelling. In the near future, time travel is a reality.
