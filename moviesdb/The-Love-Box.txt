The Love Box

 "The Love Box" is a dark comedy that follows the struggle of Samuel as he meets his girlfriend Poppy's family for the first time. A normally daunting task that is further complicated by the fact that Poppie's parents own the largest family run, adult intimacy store (porn shop) in the world. Hilarity ensues as Samuel is forced to deal with an androgynous sibling, porn star dinner guests and a crash sexual education course by Poppy's father. Through Samuel's journey it becomes clear that it's not what we are but who we are that truly matters in life.
