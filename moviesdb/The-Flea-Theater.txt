The Flea Theater

 A half hour documentary follows the 2008 season of the award winning internationally known Flea Theater in New York City, combining behind-the-scenes footage of various productions with more formal interviews with Jim Simpson, Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray, Adam Rapp, and Elizabeth Swados amongst others. As this season coincided with the excitement of the 2008 presidential election, the productions reflected the political and social climate and made for a particularly vibrant season.
