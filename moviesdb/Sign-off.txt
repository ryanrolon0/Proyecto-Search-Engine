Sign-off

 The television station sign-off was commonplace once. When the station was about to go off the air at night, a short film comprised of landscapes and national symbols unspooled, accompanied by the national anthem. Today, the sign-off is an anachronism. I made this film partly to address this type of presentation and to ask how we came to feel a sense of identification through generational decisions that designated the arbitrary as a signifier.
