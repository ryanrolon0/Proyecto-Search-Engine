The F.L.I.R Project

 The F.L.I.R. Project focuses on the final Dark Question of the Waco tragedy... "did the FBI fire upon the Branch Davidians as they attempted to escape the burning building?" The film examines the Danforth re-creation at Ft. Hood, Texas on March 19, 2000. The test seems to be rigged to produce the desired government outcome. Lots of scientific evidence, presented in rapid fire fashion. So did the FBI fire on the Davidians? Watch the film and you decide.
