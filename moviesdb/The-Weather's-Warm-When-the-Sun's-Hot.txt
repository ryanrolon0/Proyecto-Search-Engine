The Weather's Warm When the Sun's Hot

 After considering the feeble code of ethics surrounding the financial world, Laurence leaves his job as a mortgage broker and takes off to the west coast with a rogue drifter named Walrus. As he tries to sort out his uncertain future, their wandering odyssey unravels into a series of increasingly petty ploys by Walrus to empty Laurence's bank account. Laurence, once committed to the prescribed edicts of financial institutions, begins to see striking similarities in Walrus' schemes and must face the realities of greed, spending, and attachment once they are lost in the desolate wilds of the American southwest.
