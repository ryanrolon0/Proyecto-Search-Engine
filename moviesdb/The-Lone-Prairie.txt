The Lone Prairie

 Lucky Dawson and his pal Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys (Leon McAuliffe, Millard Kelso, Joe Holley, Harley Huggins and Luke Wills) ride into the town of Rimrock, which is under the ruthless control of Lafe Kinney and his chief lieutenant Ed Slade. Knowing the railroad is coming thru the Halliday ranch, Kinney is having Halliday's cattle rustled to keep him from paying off his note. When Lucky arrives and buys some of Halliday's cattle, Kinney has Halliday robbed. But Lucky can identify the money and suspecting Kiney, has a plan that will trap him.
