Sevda heiﬂt Liebe

 The film begins with two contrasting scenes. The first shows Yussuf threatening another man (Adran) with a gun; the second is a love scene between 22 year old Sevda and Adran. Sevda is not allowed by her Turkish family in Berlin, particularly controlled by her tyrannical brother, Yussuf, to date any men at all. Meanwhile, Yussuf boasts about the dozens of girfriends he has, all whores - as are all women according to him, except his sister Sevda whose chastity Yussuf makes his personal crusade. Resigned to Yussuf's "right" to act this way (being a man), while she must lie and live in fear for her love, Sevda persuades her parents to allow her to study in Hamburg. Adran could then come along, while Yussuf and the family stay behind in Berlin. Will the plan work?
