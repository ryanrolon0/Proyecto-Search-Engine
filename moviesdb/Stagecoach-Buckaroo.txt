Stagecoach Buckaroo

 Saved from a lynching party when Molly Denton ('Nell O'Day' (qv)) and Nina Kincaid ('Anne Nagel' (qv)) bring proof of mistaken identity, roving cowpuncher Steve Hardin ('Johnny Mack Brown' (qv)) is offered a job as a stagecoach guard by Molly's father Joseph Denton ('Henry Hall (I)' (qv)). When Denton is ambushed and killed in an attempt to get a gold shipment through to the next town, Steve signs on himself and his sidekick, Clem Clemmons ('Fuzzy Knight' (qv)), as driver and guard for the stage line.
