The Cuckoo Clock

 While this could very well be a germ-of-an-idea parody of an Edgar Allan Poe story, The Tell-Tale Heart, there is no way on this earth that Mr. Poe, credited or uncredited, had anything to do with this cartoon, in spite of the fact somebody has given him an (uncredited) as a writer. Bottom line, a cat is more than a bit annoyed at the cuckoo in a clock, and sets out to get rid of it, but ends up getting blown to the hereafter while the clock plays an fitting tune.
