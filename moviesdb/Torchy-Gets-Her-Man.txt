Torchy Gets Her Man

 Notorious counterfeiter 100 Dollar Bill Bailey has eluded police capture for fifteen years passing off his signature C-notes while avoiding capture. He brazenly passes himself off as Secret Service agent Charles Mitchel to McBride and McTavish and recruits police help in what they think will be a sting operation at the local racetrack to catch Bailey. Actually, Bailey/Mitchell uses the opportunity to exchange his phony bills for the real thing right under Steve's nose. Torchy with the aid of a furloughed Gahagan and A German Shephered named Blitzen are able to penetrate the counterfeiting ring.
