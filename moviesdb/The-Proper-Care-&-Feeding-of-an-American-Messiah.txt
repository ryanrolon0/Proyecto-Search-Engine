The Proper Care & Feeding of an American Messiah

 'The Proper Care & Feeding of an American Messiah' is the mock documentary story of a man who thinks he is a messiah. Not the messiah, but rather a local, regionally-selected messiah for his own hometown. He's on a quest, desperately trying to raise money for a town-wide rally where he hopes to announce his deity - and to determine his true, God-given 'special purpose' in life. Which may or may not have something to do with ailments of the lower gastrointestinal tract, but he won't be sure until he hears more or less directly from God.
