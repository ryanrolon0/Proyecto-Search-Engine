The Texas Marshal

 Around the town of Cactus Creek a rancher has been killed and others are missing and Marshal Tim Rand has been called in. Ernest Moore has found tin ore and now holds many of the rancher's deeds. Comparing bullets leads Tim to Moore's henchman and then opening Moore's safe he finds the ore samples and the deeds. But his plan to bring in Moore and his men using Art Davis' short wave radio is thwarted when Art is captured.
