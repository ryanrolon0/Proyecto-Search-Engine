Vroom

 A love story - a young man for an older woman and his best friend and his Chevrolet. Jake is a romantic with a vision. Ringe is his whiplash wild best mate. Their lives in a small northern town are bleak with unemployment and domestic wrangles. But then Susan, the 'older woman', moves in next door. Inexorably, events lead Jake, Ringe and Susan to a bid for freedom and the open road in the sleek American car the lads have renovated. Then their troubles really begin.
