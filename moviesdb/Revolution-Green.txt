Revolution Green

 Revolution Green is about one man's vision to manufacture biodiesel and one man's quest to use it in his big rig; it's about the American dream and how renewable energy is critical to the future of the world economy. Centered on a husband and wife from Maui, Hawaii; the film documents how in 1996, with no financial backing, they pioneered a waste to energy process that took thousands of tons of waste vegetable oil destined for the Maui landfill and refined it into ASTM certified, B100 biodiesel. This type of diesel fuel can be used in any type of diesel engine without modification. What first appeared as a simple solution to try and solve a landfill problem became the first private company in America to refine premium, B100 biodiesel and offer it to the public. Their unique way of life intertwined with a distinct ensemble of farmers, truckers, governors, business owners, actors and country music legends offer the audience a chance to explore our culture as America stands on the brink of leading the world's first, sustainable, industrial revolution.
