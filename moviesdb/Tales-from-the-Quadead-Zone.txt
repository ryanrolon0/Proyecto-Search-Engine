Tales from the Quadead Zone

 Actress Shirley Latanya Jones returns from the director's first film (Black Devil Doll from Hell) to be in front of Turner's camcorder, and reads two spooky tales to the ghost of her dead son, Bobby. The second story features a zombie clown from Hell. When we finally return to Shirley, she kills her hot-headed boyfriend, and there's a bloody finale as the cops arrive.
