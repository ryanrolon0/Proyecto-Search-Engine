Texas Stagecoach

 The Kinkaids and the Harpers both run stage lines and are friendly competitors. Appleby is after the stage line and convinces the two owners to build a spur line to the same town. Then he has both projects sabotaged pitting the friends against each other and running them out of money. Larry Kincaid and his father, Jim, own one of the two stage lines in Ludlow, and their friendly rivals are Joan Harper and her brother Bob. Banker John Appleby hires Shoshone Larsen to stir up trouble between the two outfits, hoping to step in and take over both. When gold is found at the nearby town of Kingman, Appleby interests both the Kincaids and Harpers in building a road to the boom town, and advances them the construction money. Larsen rides with the Kincaids and is entrusted with building their road. He disguises himself as Larry and steals the Harper horses. Larry, determined to prove his innocence, tracks down the horses and captures three of Larsen's henchmen. The latter, fearful the families will be reconciled, leads a raid on the Kincaid camp and wounds Jim. The Harpers, thanks to the obstructions of Larsen, are soon broke and Appleby takes over their line. Jim realizes the Appleby plot and rides to tell Larry and the Harpers. Larsen trails him and shoots him from ambush. Larry and the Harpers find Jim's body and the uncompleted letter "L-A" in the dust.
