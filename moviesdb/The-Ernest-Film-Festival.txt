The Ernest Film Festival

 Before he went to camp, before he went to jail, before he saved Christmas, before he was scared stupid, before he went to Africa and before he was in the army, Ernest P. Worrell hosted a variety of commercials, and a lot of them are here on this video. He even makes public service announcements. It also features many of his bloopers.
