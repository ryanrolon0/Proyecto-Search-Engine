Real Things

 Sebastian falls in love with Michelle, who just happens to be Paul, his best friend's fiancee. She doesn't go for it, so Sebastian loses his mind while he attempts to find away to steal her away. After a psychotic adventure involving the inventor of Velcro, a mob of ex-girlfriends, an imaginary best friend, and a foul mouthed mythical creature, Sebastian settles in to his insanity, and runs off with his fantasy version of Michelle.
