The Adventures of Sass Parilla the Singing Gorilla

 THE ADVENTURES OF SASS PARILLA THE SINGING GORILLA is a four chapter motion picture starring famous guy-in-a-gorilla-suit Sass Parilla. Each of the four ADVENTURES is a single story and part the larger, four-part narrative. In THE ADVENTURES the heroic Sass Parilla must fight off the advances of the diabolical Black Widow. This fiend will stop at nothing to destroy Sass employing a giant, robot gorilla, a mystical snow warrior, the undead, and more. Fortunately Sass has the assistance of suave scientists and a resourceful reporter to battle his way through the fantastic saga of adventure, thrills, romance and laughter. THE ADVENTURES OF SASS PARILLA THE SINGING GORILLA were made primarily in residential warehouse space in Atlanta's West End. Drawing inspiration from comic books, late-night cult films and Saturday matinees, a group of filmmakers and artists contributed their time and talents to making the film. All four ADVENTURES were shot simultaneously and used miniatures, hand-made costumes and props, and well over a dozen sets.
