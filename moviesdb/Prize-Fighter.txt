Prize Fighter

 New York City sportswriter, 'Bill Corum' (qv), drops in at the gymnasium where up-and-coming heavyweight 'Roland La Starza' (qv), whom the gym-rat hanger-ons declare is the best fighter to come along since 'Joe Louis' (qv). And Mr. LaStarza does look good against the gym sparring partners he trains against. About four Years later, Bill Corum is the ringside announcer at Madison Square Garden where 'Roland LaStarza' is fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world against 'Rocky Marciano' (qv.) At the end of the bout, (quote) the best fighter since 'Joe Louis' (qv) (unquote) is seen occupying the stool in the loser's corner.
