The Sacred Fire

 A young man who appears to be a bum is approached by a young woman who recognizes him from high school. After she buys him lunch, he claims to be a hunter of psychic vampires that steal our vitality, our sacred fire, while having the appearance of drunken bums. He believes her fire to be particularly strong, making her highly at risk. Based on a story by magical realist Charles de Lint, Kyle Baker believes in psychic vampires that drain charismatic people's essences, their sacred fire, while disguised as homeless people. Undercover homeless, he is discovered by Luann Sommerson, a former high school classmate, who offers him a meal. He tries to explain his story to her, believing her to have a strong inner fire that is sure to be attacked.
