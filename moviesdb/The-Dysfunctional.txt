The Dysfunctional

 One day, a guy (Dysfunctional) gets out of his bed and finds out that entire world and universe is simply going backwards. Minutes count backward, things appear to react against gravity and so on. Dysfunctional finds couple of other people and tries to stop this horror - which leads them to a brand new dimension.
