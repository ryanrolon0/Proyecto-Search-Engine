Sliced

 Sliced Unrequited Life. At a public phone booth, a call from a stranger stops Seb's mundane reality cold. He's alone in the world, and someone, somewhere is trying to tell him that his life might not be wholly his own. Shot using only a digital SLR, over 40,000 images skitter across the screen in 7 short minutes. Sliced compacts and layers both time and space to create a disturbing and alternate reality fueled by Seb's accelerating paranoia. Doomed to repeat the pointless rituals of work and home, Seb drifts from womb toward tomb... until a familiar voice reaches out promising answers ... and a choice.
