Terminus des anges

 Angels terminal is a combination of three short films, everyone written and directed by three well none and talented young Moroccan directors(Narjiss Nejjar, Mohamed Mouftakir and Hicham Lasri). In order to succeed an original experiment and because we believe that cinema is a visual language that is inspired by the daily reality, human issues and it's an amazing way to move closer people in the consciousness of a common humanity we decided to treat this issue. Our film indeed, is a reflection on the ignorance that surrounds the Aids specially in Morocco, through a story that articulates around characters who look like us or whom we should have been able to cross one day. A fiction that puts words in the place of our shameful silences. Three short stories, three characters that cross themselves in the same drama. Three windows on ignorance, stigma and loneliness, in front of the diseases denial.
