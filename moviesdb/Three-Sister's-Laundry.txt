Three Sister's Laundry

 If you took the romantic situation of Cinderella, the fun musicality of Grease and added a dash of My Big Fat Greek Wedding you would have Three Sister's Laundry. Lucy is a shy, stereotypical middle child who doesn't know her place in life. She works with her two sisters at a laundry mat that was willed to them by their parents. She is unhappy at the laundry mat and escapes life through her vivid daydreams of dancing, her true heart's desire. Lucy walks by the same dance studio everyday and watches the man of her dreams whirl by. She longs to be there but can't find the courage until one day Ned Curtis drops off his laundry and makes Lucy's dream come true.
