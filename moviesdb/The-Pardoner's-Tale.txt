The Pardoner's Tale

 During the Great Depression, Jacob, Jeremiah, and Lucas leave behind lives of loss in Montana and set out to find work in Colorado. On their way, they must employ desperate and selfish measures to get by, often stealing from others in order to survive. When they stumble upon a resting place that should provide some relief, they instead find something that opens a door into the darkest part of who they are.
