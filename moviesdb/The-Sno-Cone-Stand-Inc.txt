The Sno Cone Stand Inc

 The Sno Cone Stand is a light-hearted Austin Original Comedy about three twenty-something stock broker trainees who hate their jobs and their self-absorbed boss at Miller-Stinch Financial. They will try just about anything, including selling snow cones, "to climb their way down the corporate ladder." Sonny Mctard, the lovable loser with salesman syndrome, and grand ideas for Starbucks-like success, ignores the good advice of his logical friend, Juan Sanchez Hernandez Martinez, and convinces his womanizing jock friend, Tony Romper, to join him in what turns out to be a hilarious summer adventure of non-stop travesties, leading them to find friendship and success on their own terms.
