Striking Poses

 Wealthy press mosquito Gage Sullivan is arrested by FBI agents Linus Stahl and Valerie after burying blood-stained clothes. She explains it was all part of her endless efforts to get rid of a clever, persistent stalker. Gage hired charming security specialist Nick Love. He contracts the Major to turn her home into a fortress, gets her a new identity and identifies an ex-con contract murders suspect, whose aliases include Badger. After Gage's assistant Casey is kidnapped and probably killed, she hires Badger for revenge. This starts a series of discoveries, stings and dramatic twists.
