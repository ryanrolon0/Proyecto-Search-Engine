The Wasp Woman

 Janice Starlin is a model who has built up her own cosmetics company. Until now, she has always modelled for her company's advertisements, but now that she is in her 40's, investors are advising her to step aside in favor of a younger model. In desperation, she consults a scientist working on a new youth serum based on wasp hormones. Eager for any possible treatment, Janice agrees to be the first human test subject. At first, the results seem miraculous she looks like a 25-year-old. As time goes on, however, the terrible side effects of the drug become all too apparent.
