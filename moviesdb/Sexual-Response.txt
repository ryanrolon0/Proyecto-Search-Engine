Sexual Response

 A radio call-in host helps people with their relationships, but finds her own marriage lacking. A man approaches her in a bar, and soon she's having an affair with him. The lover starts pushing her away when she begins falling in love with him, and she begins suspecting he has ulterior motives when he steals her husband's gun.
