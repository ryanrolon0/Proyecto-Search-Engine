Shanghai 1976

 Shanghai 1976 is a moving story that tells the tale of a forbidden love and of the loss of innocence in Shanghai, China, in the turbulent year 1976. Four young people come of age and fall in love against the backdrop of political and historical events. Their heritage reflects Shanghai's cosmopolitan history. Two Eurasian girls, sisters, meet and fall in love with two Chinese men. As their lives become more entangled, they find themselves ostracized. While the Great Cultural Revolution unravels around them, these four begin to dream new dreams, to reach for freedom and to nurture hope for a brighter future.
