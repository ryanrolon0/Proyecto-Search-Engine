The Golden Dolphin

 When John inherits Golden Manor from his Uncle, he and his family move in to the wonderful mansion and quickly make friends. But Nicholas Seaton, the bitter son of John's Uncle, who has been left out of the will, is hellbent on getting the Mansion back, and claims to have in his possession, The Golden Dolphin, which will earn him the right to own the mansion.
