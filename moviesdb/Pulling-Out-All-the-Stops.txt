Pulling Out All the Stops

 Pulling Out All the Stops honors the pipe organ in America. From New York's Fifth Avenue to Harlem, from Hollywood to a small town in North Carolina, this film shows how the pipe organ plays a role in people's lives today. Special highlights include comedy brought to life with the "Mighty Wurlitzer"; the moving story of a congregation's nine-year dream - and the factory that made that dream come true; and a special tour for young people inside a three-story tall organ. Most of all, Pulling Out All the Stops celebrates the widely differing communities of people who love and cherish this instrument.
