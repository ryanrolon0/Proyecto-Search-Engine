 Terry Mc Neal is a 9 year old with the eyes of an angel and the smile of a saint. Following the untimely death of her parents, she moves in with her beloved Aunt Jana, a dreamer with a heart that's bigger than her financial reality. With her laptop computer, the last birthday present her parents gave her, Terry finds a way to communicate with her Mom and Dad by sending homemade movies to them in Heaven through the Internet. Eager to help with her movie making, Aunt Jana sets aside her own skepticism and accommodates Terry as the two embark on a touching filmmaking adventure that leaves no emotional stone unturned. When the world turns on Aunt Jana and she faces the prospect of losing Terry due to financial struggles, Terry proposes a solution that most would call a miracle. All Terry asks is that you simply believe.
