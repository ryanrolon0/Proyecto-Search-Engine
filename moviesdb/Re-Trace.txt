Re Trace

 Two women set out on the road to find their best friend, who disappeared 10 years before. One of them has a camera. Stakeouts, cheap hotels and gun ranges carry them through the South, as they re-visit friendship and loss. A soundtrack of early '90s San Francisco punk bands drifts off the scratchy car speakers, lending a connection to their past.
