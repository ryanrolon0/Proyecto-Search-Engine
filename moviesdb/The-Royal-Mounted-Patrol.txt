The Royal Mounted Patrol

 "Lucky" Lawrence, an airplane pilot, and Tom Jeffries, a cowpuncher, becomes friends while training for The Royal Canadain Mounted Police. "Lucky" is assigned to the Aip Patrol branch, while Tom is sent to open a new post in a remote forest region. There, he finds "Frenchy" Duvalle, a lumber camp boss, flagrantly violating the Canadian forest laws. Their run-in is interrupted by an epidemic outbreak. "Lucky" flies in with the life-saving vaccines. Later, Frenchy's sister, Betty , unaware of her brother's unlawful activities, comes to the post as a school teacher. "Frency," trying to illegally float logs down the river, imperiling the wharves, sets fire to the grasslands near his camp, when Tom tries to stop the log drive. The fire spreads, endangering an Indian family, and "Lucky" flies in to rescue them. Tom goes after "Frenchy", who has already killed one Mountie, and "Frenchy" holds his sister as an hostage.
