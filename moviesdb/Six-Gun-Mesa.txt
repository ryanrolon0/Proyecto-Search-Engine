Six Gun Mesa

 After four of his men have been poisoned by Joe Lang ('Carl Mathews' )qv)), a member of a land-grabbing outlaw gang led secretly by town boss Carson ('Leonard Penn' (qv)), rancher Mark Jones ('Steve Clark (I)' (qv)) beds his herd on Six Gun Mesa just outside of town. Lang stampedes the cattle and Jones and all of his cowhands are killed. Carson implicates and frames ranch foreman Dave Emmett ('Riley Hill (I)' (qv)) for the crimes, and Dave's friends, Johnny Mack ('Johnny Mack Brown' (qv)) and Whiskey Evans ('Milburn Morante' (qv)), set out to prove his innocence. To get the herd on Six Gun Mesa, Carson has the owner and hands killed. But one hand, Dave Emmett was in town instead of with the cattle. So Carter kills a man and frames Dave for the murder. Johnny Mack Brown arrives just in time to stop the lynching and sets out to find the real killer. Getting the Doctor who falsified the murder evidence drunk gets him the information he wants and this leads to the showdown with Carson.
