Two Ships

 Morgan, a young woman racked with the perils of lost love, can't get to sleep. She wonders if she'll ever be able to sleep again or feel the charge of experiencing a connection with someone new. Tom, a bookish kind of guy, is bored out of his brain working the graveyard shift at a convenience store. He too is firmly stuck in a rut. Morgan ventures into the convenience store one night during a bout of insomnia. There she strikes up conversation with Tom and what unfolds over the following nights, ultimately turns life around for both of them.
