Reversible Errors

 A black man is sentenced to death for the brutal death of three people. However, weeks before his execution, new evidence indicating his possible innocence arises. William H. Macy stars as the defense attorney who must quickly determine his innocence and find the information to free his client. Meanwhile the original prosecuting attorney is concerned about her future if she bungled the case. The investigating officer, who is her lover, is totally convinced that they got the right man and is more than willing to destroy any evidence that indicates otherwise. Not so easily cast off is the confession of a dying man, who claims he actually did the crime and framed the other man. In 1996, there is a triple homicide in a dinning place, and Sergeant Larry Starczek is in charge of the investigation. His lover, the ambitious prosecuting attorney Muriel Wynn, follows him and they get the name of a suspect. The smalltime crook Romeo 'Squirrel' Gandolph is arrested, confesses the crime and is sentenced to the death row. Seven years later, Muriel is married and has had a meteoric professional ascension in her career; Starczek is retired; and the judge of the case Gillian Sullivan has just been released from prison after the accusation of bribery. A couple of weeks before the execution of Squirrel, the corporate lawyer Arthur Raven is assigned by his associates to defend Squirrel for free as a part of a political marketing. However, the confession of a cancerous prisoner assuming that he had committed the murder reopens the case exposing secrets and wounds.
