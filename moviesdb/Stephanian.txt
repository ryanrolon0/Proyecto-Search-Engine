Stephanian

 Stephanian is a portrait of one of Toronto's last family-owned corner pharmacies. For almost 50 years, Mathilde Stephanian worked seven days a week with her husband Barkev, a pharmacist. Since her husband's death in 2005, Mathilde has transformed the store into a time capsule filled with remnants of its history as a pharmacy alongside an eclectic array of secondhand items from her home. Costume jewelery, Syrian textiles and antique tea sets share display cases with 30 year old bars of soap, slowly rusting razors and century-old bottles of powders. Narrated by two generations of Stephanian women, and shot on 16mm, this film tells the story of a family trying to maintain a connection to a space, a neighborhood and a way of life.
