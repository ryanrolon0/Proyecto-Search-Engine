Sundown Riders

 This film was produced and released in 1944 by Film Enterprises for the 16mm school-and-institutional market, and was picked up and released in 1948 by Astor for theatrical 35mm showings. Both versions finds the citizens of Rockford upset over a series of murders and robberies. The Sundowners, Andy Clyde (Andy Clyde), Jay Kirby (Jay Kirby) and Russ Wade (Russell Wade), ride into Rockford and innocently takes jobs with Tug Wilson (Jack Ingram) and his tough crew of line riders, who are in cahoots with Yeager (Hal Price) in a big land swindle scheme. The Sundowners fight their way out of Wilson's camp, and seeing a runaway, give chase and rescue Donna Fraser (Evelyn Finley, who, in the real world, could outride all three of them), daughter of Dan Fraser (Steve Clark), who owns the land Yeager is after. They join forces with local Ranger Bob Casey (Marshall Reed) against the Wilson/Yeager faction. Seeking to escape, Wilson kills Yeager, kidnaps Donna and heads for the Mexican border. The Sundowners and Casey, aided by a faithful Indian friend (Bill Hazlet/Chief Many Treaties), ride down the outlaws and rescue Donna.
