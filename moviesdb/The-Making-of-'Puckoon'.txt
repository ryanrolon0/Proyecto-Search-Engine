The Making of 'Puckoon'

 Puckoon was Spike Milligan's great, mad novel - a story of a tiny Irish community split down the middle by a new boundary line between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Long considered 'unfilmable', the book took eight long years to make it to the screen. In this warm 'making of' documentary, writer/director Terry Ryan and his multitudinous cast tell how it came to be made.
