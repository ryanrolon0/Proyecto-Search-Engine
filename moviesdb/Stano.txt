Stano

 Bobby Stano had everything going for him. Fresh out of high school, he was signed to the majors, had a beautiful girlfriend, everything was looking up. That is, until he and his friends get into a fight with a neighboring gang. The confrontation results in an accidental fatality and quickly changes Bobby's life forever. He's found guilty of murder and locked in prison for the next thirteen years. When Bobby is released, he's faced with a vilified reputation, a relationship to rekindle and a new life to find. Bobby lands a job assisting his former minor league baseball coach and takes Manny, a difficult yet talented player, under his wing. Manny helps the rest of the team realize thirteen years in the slammer didn't strip Bobby of his talents. It's not long before Bobby is added to the roster and becomes a star player alongside Manny. When the Yankees scouts show up, this could be Bobby's second chance. A touching underdog story about triumph over hardship, as well as a grave look at the integration of criminals back into society after serving time. The law gives Bobby a second chance, but does his community?
