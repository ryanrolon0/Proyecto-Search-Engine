Steel Against the Sky

 Rough-hewn Rocky Evans has two great loves--his job building bridges and beautiful Helen Powers, his boss' daughter. But it's Rocky's shiftless brother Chuck who wins Helen's affections. Chuck even takes a job on Rocky's bridge-building crew to woo Helen, but the two brothers soon find themselves clashing over work and love. A story involving action, adventure, romance, crime and comedy (and lots of stock footage) against the background of large-scale bridge building involving a father, 'Pop' Evans, and his three sons, "Rocky", Chuck and Pete. "Rocky", in addition to taking pride in his profession, is romancing Helen Powers, daughter of the president of the construction company, and is doing okay in both pursuits until younger-and-shiftless brother Chuck moves in on Helen, causing more than a few problems between the brothers, despite the efforts of "Pop" who tries to keep the feminine wiles of Helen from breaking up his home and family.
