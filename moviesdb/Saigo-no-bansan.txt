Saigo no bansan

 Yuji Kotorida has become plastic surgeon to the rich and famous - almost over night transforming himself from nebbish to charismatic icon. His secret? He eats women. In a flashback, we watch the flowering of his proclivity - from an initial taste, and a search that takes him to Hong Kong, to murder. After the flashback, he promises a colleague he will prepare meat for her wedding banquet. At about the same time, the police express suspicion. Can Dr. Kotorida carve out an escape?
