The Exotic House of Wax

 In this erotic fantasy, when a naive young woman (Blake Pickett) inherits a wax museum, she's shocked to discover that her family legacy is no ordinary tourist trap. Statues from all periods of history come alive -- and come together -- when supernatural sexual amulets are placed around their necks. The action heats up when the world's most memorable mythical figures engage in a love-fest that's truly one for the ages.
