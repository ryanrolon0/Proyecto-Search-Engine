S.O.S. Extraterrestria

 The world as a plaything for a giantess from outer space. A Godzilla-imitation on the way to herself the streets of a big city, fooling around, producing destruction, copulating with the Eiffel Tower. An orchestra of big feelings, the melodrama, defamed in infantile sounds and absurd costume, in make-up-persiflage and grotesque body-art-performances.
