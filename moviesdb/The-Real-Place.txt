The Real Place

 In 2008, John Murrell (1945- ), playwright, librettist, and translator, received a lifetime achievement award from Canada's Governor General. To celebrate, this animated film dramatizes an interview with Murrell talks of he leaving home at 13, finding friends in books and writers and music, and seeking a real place for his characters from which he can create them fully before casting them out into the world. Murrell's reflections give way to actors speaking and singing his words. He concludes, "I have lived the luckiest life."
