Putot

 Putot (Visayan for "small") is the heartfelt story of a young boy growing up at a squatter colony by the sea. Putot, aged 13, is a taciturn boy who takes care of his mentally-ill father, and ekes out a living selling mussels. He meets Mayang, a mysterious young girl with secrets of her own. A friendship begins between the two.
