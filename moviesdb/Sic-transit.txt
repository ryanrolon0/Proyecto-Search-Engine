Sic transit

 "I am 25 and i feel old. Not old, but not young any more. There's always a memory between me and the present moment. And the memory is more beautyful." In transit in Paris, Marc has an apointment with his friend Denis and ex-girl friend CEcile. They haven't seen each other for a year. They spend the day together. Between them, remembrance of their common past, memories of their personal past, views of their lifes and hopes. This is the birth of nostalgia.
