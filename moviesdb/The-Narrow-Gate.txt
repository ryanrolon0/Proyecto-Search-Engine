The Narrow Gate

 Sarah Webber is a pregnant wife and mother who has her world turned upside-down by the heart-breaking events of 9/11. Suddenly confronted with her own fears, prejudices and insecurities, she must find the strength in her heart to continue living in a world she no longer understands, and to confront the situations that terrify her to her very core. The Narrow Gate follows Sarah Webber, an Upper East Side mother and housewife, through the bewildering world of post-9/11 Manhattan. Sarah's perfect life crumbles before her as her mounting paranoia drives her husband away and leaves her alone with a young daughter and a baby on the way. Slowly, she rebuilds and fills her formerly closed life with a new openness, just as her family and friends are dealing with their own crises. In a chance encounter in a park, Sarah proves her newfound strength by saving Safiyyah, a Middle Eastern woman being brutally beaten in a hate crime. Her continuing friendship with Safiyyah and her family put Sarah in the unique position of preventing a future terrorist attack on the city.
