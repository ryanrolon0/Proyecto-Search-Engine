Sautela Bhai

 Teacher Tulsiram is married to Saraswati and has two step-brothers, Advocate Rajaram, and Shankar who is uneducated. When Rajaram returns, Tulsiram wants him to get married to Bindiya, the daughter of Thakur Narayandas, and is displeased when he finds that Rajaram has married Sheena, the daughter of wealthy Advocate Surendranath. Narayandas gets upset after Tulsiram attempts to get Shankar married to Bindiya, and he gives Tulsiram an ultimatum - get Rajaram to marry his daughter - or he will forcibly take over their land and house, which have been mortgaged with him to pay for Rajaram's education. Then Tulsiram gets arrested on charges of Fraud, Theft and Cheating. Shortly thereafter Shankar, too, is arrested for abducting Bindiya and holding her hostage. Rajaram returns home to defend his brothers but may end up regretting this decision when he finds out who the public prosecutor is.
