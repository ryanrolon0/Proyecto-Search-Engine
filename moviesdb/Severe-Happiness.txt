Severe Happiness

 A short mockumentary about a young woman who is happy all the time. Literally, she cannot be anything but happy, it's what you could consider a reverse depression. Her parents are looking to diagnose and medicate her to make her 'normal'. These are the interviews her doctor conducts with her family and peers to pinpoint the problem. Is her happiness abnormal? If so, is she doomed to become normal?
