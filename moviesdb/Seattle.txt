Seattle

 This Traveltalk entry visits Seattle and other areas in the state of Washington. Seattle was a small city until the 1897 gold rush. During WWI, it served as a major shipping center for lumber that was transported through the Panama Canal to East Coast shipbuilders. We also visit a Weyerhaeuser lumber camp located between Longview and Tacoma, and the city of Everett, where lumber is used in the burgeoning aircraft industry.
