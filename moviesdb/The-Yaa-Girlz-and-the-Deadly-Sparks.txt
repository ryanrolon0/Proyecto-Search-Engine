The Yaa Girlz and the Deadly Sparks

 The YAA Girlz and the Deadly Sparks from the punk rock days of the early 1980's, formed in reaction to the all male skate 'crews' like the Jaks, and then the Jerks, whose skateboarders didn't allow women as members. The documentary consists of interviews with a few of these pioneering women skaters today as they talk about what it was like then, combined with a montage of photos taken during their heyday, skating and hanging out. The accompanying soundtrack consists of music from local SF punk bands of the era Racer.
