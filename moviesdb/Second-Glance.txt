Second Glance

 On an afternoon in Central Park, two strangers sit across from each other, reading silently. Each begin to note in their thoughts uncanny resemblances between the person sitting opposite, and a lost loved one. The man reminds the woman of her father; the woman reminds the man of his wife. As the moment begins to pass, they struggle between their desire to greet their loved one's apparent double, and their conditioned instinct to maintain a safe distance.
