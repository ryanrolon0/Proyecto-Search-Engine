The Lead by Example Project

 If your surroundings do not contain aspects that you want in your life, then create them. You never know whose ATTENTION might follow through your ACTION. In 2004, musicians living in Orlando, FL USA (EARTH) discuss how the influence of the Solillaquists Of Sound has affected their lives, turning dreams into reality. They have become leaders of motivation, connecting the community surrounding them. But it's not about them. It's about you, because leaders do not aspire to have followers, they inspire to create other leaders. Guidance And Determination To Support Motivation Direction Is A Sign - "Brother, can you Paradigm?"
