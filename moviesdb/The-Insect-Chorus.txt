The Insect Chorus

 After years of living with only one another, twin sisters Juliette and Beatrice long for something new. One morning, a lonely traveling salesman, Zeb Ebelbu, appears on their doorstep. He seduces both sisters, unwittingly giving life to long buried resentments. Set in a surreal world, this tale is an unexpected twist on the conventions of "once upon a time."
