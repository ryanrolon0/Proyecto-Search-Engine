Stealing Innocence

 Stealing Innocence is a gripping portrayal of the ongoing hostilities in the Middle East seen through the eyes of two young girls. The children are best friends even though one is Israeli and one is Palestinian. Unfortunately events spin out of their control, testing their friendship to destruction. This is a tragedy that leaves its victims without dignity or hope and gives a human dimension to the violence in the Middle East.
