Runscape

 RUNSCAPE is a political response to the current privatization and militarization of our cities. When running remain the only unbounded space in the urban field, a young man is constantly running in Hong Kong back alleys and left over spaces, revealing alternative route to the globalized and controlled urban spaces. Following the fragmented course of images, a narrative unfold the history of street fighting from the 19th century Parisians revolutions, 1968 and up to contemporary combat.
