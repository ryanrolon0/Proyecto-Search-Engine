Small Change Movie

 Small change is about Dave, an average guy who is fed up with office life and corporate jargon. He has a grim outlook on his future, but uncovers a path of self-discovery and new-found direction when he meets Ernie, a figure from the past who encourages him to follow the dream he never realized he'd had.
