The Red Cross

 "A spirited picture showing the work of the Red Cross nurses and physicians on the battlefield. The end of a firing line is shown just before a charge. Several men have dropped from wounds and a Red Cross ambulance dashes up. A nurse and surgeon dress the wound in the head of one of the sufferers while his comrade writes down his last statement."
