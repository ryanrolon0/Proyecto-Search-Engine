Sonor

 SONOR tells us about the encounter of an film musician and a former ballet dancer, who is deaf by birth. Two people with an apparently conflictive acoustic perception enter the realm of a sound journey. They explore acoustic spaces, experiment with various instruments and seek for sounds. Their experiences are interpreted in a musical improvisation. SONOR is inviting the audience to undergo a chance in its own perception of tone and sound.
