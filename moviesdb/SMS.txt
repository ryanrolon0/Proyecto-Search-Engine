SMS

 SMS is a simple story with strong McLuhan-Ian undercurrents to it. A young girl is alone in a house that is broken into by burglars. Hiding for her life and desperate for help, her only way of communicating with the outside world is her new mobile phone; and there is only one number on it - a wrong number. Will she get help at all, and in time? How far will someone go to help someone whose identity is only a number on their mobile phone? The story subtly embodies McLuhan's theory of technological determinism in saying that technology shapes our lives as we shaped it's tools.
