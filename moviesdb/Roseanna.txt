Roseanna

 A young American girl is found dead in Gota Kanal, Swedens largest channel. Since there are hardly any clues or evidence at all it seems as if the murder cant be solved. Martin Beck and his men are assigned to the case. Soon they find a likely suspect and together with a police woman they begin a cat and mouse game to catch him. The unidentified dead body of a young woman is found in Göta kanal, Sweden's longest canal. At first there seem to be no clues to what happened, but thorough research by criminal inspector Martin Beck and his colleagues reveal that she is a librarian from Nebraska, USA. Helped by amateur footage from a cruising ship, they find a likely suspect but still need more evidence before they can arrest him.
