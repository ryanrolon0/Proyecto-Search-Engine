Skeins

 This little knitting circle has been running for over two years and despite minimal advertising, people are finding their way to the venue, mainly by word of mouth. Some pop in for only one session, others have been coming every week from the start. Each person has their own reason for attending and for most the knitting becomes almost a secondary reason for having a glass of wine, socialising and sharing life stories.
