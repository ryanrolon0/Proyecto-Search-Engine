Taking Stock

 Marty is at a crossroads. His dad is one stock take away from finally selling the family hardware store, a place he and his best friend Robin grew up and now work. A speculative application to an interstate university course has yielded unexpected results, forcing Marty to decide if he will leave behind the life he's always known. As Marty and the rest of the staff commence the stock take that will finalise the sale, he starts to realise that leaving behind Robin will mean giving up a life with a woman who really loves him - a woman who's already slipping away after finding out about the course. It'll take some creative inspiration for Marty to truly show her how he feels.
