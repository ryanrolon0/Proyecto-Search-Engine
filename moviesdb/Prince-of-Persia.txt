Prince of Persia

 You are marked for death, yet you are unshaken. The impossible challenge you face has ignited a fire within your soul. Confident in your deadly fighting skills, thirsting for brutal battle, you are a warrior awakened. You will use every weapon, command every power, and summon every last shred of rage to defy fate. You will defend what no enemy shall take away - your life. You are hunted by Dahaka, an immortal incarnation of Fate seeking divine retribution. As 'the Prince' you will embark upon a path of both carnage and mystery to defy your preordained death. This journey leads to the infernal core of a cursed island stronghold harboring mankinds greatest fears.
