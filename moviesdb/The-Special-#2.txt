The Special #2

 Recovering addicts, Bob and T, grab a bite after a meeting. Through the course of the evening they reveal their truths, insecurities, and priorities while trying to behave for their waitress. Discovering a friendship, they realize they must work on themselves today so they can enjoy the possibilities of life's journey.
