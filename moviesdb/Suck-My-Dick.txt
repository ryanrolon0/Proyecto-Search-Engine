Suck My Dick

 A successfull novel writer called Dr. Jekyll feels haunted by Hyde, a character from his latest novel who somehow materialized. When Jekyll awakens from a surreal nightmare he realizes that Hyde took his penis away, leaving only a hole behind, what finally turns out to be the beginning of a psychological and at times quite campy journey through male fears of loss of power, identity and youth.
