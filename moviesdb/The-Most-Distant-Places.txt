The Most Distant Places

 Dr. Edgar Rodas has dedicated his life to improving the health conditions for underprivileged communities in his native Ecuador, and Cinterandes is his visionary mobile hospital and rural health care project. The Most Distant Places travels with Dr. Edgar Rodas and his team to the far reaches of Ecuador; by road, from the indigenous mountain communities to the coast with their specially designed hospital truck; and by river, deep into indigenous villages in the Amazon jungle with their surgical boat. The story goes deeper to show how an innovative rural health project grew from the success of the mobile surgery program, and how Cinterandes has become an effective model that can replicated in other developing countries. By interweaving intimate portrayals of the doctors with stories of the patients they treat, this film offers a unique look at the challenges of providing health care for impoverished people located far from adequate medical facilities.
