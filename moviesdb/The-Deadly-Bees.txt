The Deadly Bees

 Pop singer Vicki Robbins collapses from exhaustion while shooting the 1960's equivalent of a music video, and her physician prescribes a respite on Seagull Island with colleague and bee-keeper, Ralph Hargrove. Vicki finds the Hargroves' bitter marital strife oddly relaxing. But when a mysterious swarm of specially bred attack bees starts killing island residents, Vicki fights for her survival, setting fire to nearly half the structures on the island in her escape. A pop singer collapses while filming a music video. Diagnosed exhausted, she is sent to a filthy farm on the countryside to relax. However, the pop singer soon discovers that the owner of the farm, Hargrove, is growing a special kind of bees that will kill people in seconds! When the dog and the farmer's wife get killed, the pop singer must find a way to stop Hargrove, with the help of her immensely boring friend, who is a bee farmer too.
