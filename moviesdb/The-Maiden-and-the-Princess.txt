The Maiden and the Princess

 During a game of catch-the-boy-and-kiss-him, Emmy, a precocious ten-year-old, kisses another little girl, Alice. Her parents sit her down and make her call the kiss 'an accident' and Emmy is left feeling isolated and alone. She's sent a fairy tale, 'The Maiden and The Prince,' by the Grand High Council of Fairy Tale Rules and Standards, to set her down the 'right' path in life. The council assigns Hammond to narrate Emmy's story. Luckily for Emmy, Hammond often alters the morals of his stories to help children learn the lesson they truly need. Much to the chagrin of the council, Hammond uses his magical tongue and manipulates the events of Emmy's story, teaching her that she should never have to apologize for being different.
