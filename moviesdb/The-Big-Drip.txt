The Big Drip

 This all-animated Paramount Screen Song (production number X9-2) has the story of a group of animals building an Ark in assembly-line fashion in preparation for the Big Flood. The setting is in darkest Africa and features the jungle animals. They finish just before the Bouncing Ball comes along and asks the audience to participate in singing "It Ain't Gonna Rain No More."
