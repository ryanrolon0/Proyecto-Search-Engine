The Winter Men

 The film recounts the story of a mother Joyce Winter and her grown twin sons, Leonard and Richard. Richard is a mild-mannered man on the verge of disconnecting from the world he lives in. Leonard looks for connection in the midst of a lonely morgue. As the mother skillfully manipulates Richard into confronting his other half, Leonard fights for dominance. The climax of the film culminates in that confrontation and a startling realization that will leave the characters forever changed.
