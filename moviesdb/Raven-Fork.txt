Raven Fork

 The beauty of nature, the importance of friendship and the unpredictable perils of fate are each the subject and the breathtaking form of Thomas W. Oliver's cinematic experience Raven Fork. Living in the mountains of Western North Carolina, two friends Dave (Glenn LaPlante) and Blake (Frank Jordan) find life, friendship, and adrenaline in a whitewater paradise. While passing their time traveling from kayak trip to kayak trip the two make plans to run their most ambitious river to date; the class V Raven Fork, a river carved deep in the heart of the rugged Appalachian wilderness. A tragic river accident followed by a self-destructive tailspin explores the emotion of life itself, the search for closure, and the momentum of the human spirit to prevail.
