Revolver Tango

 It's the end of the evening on a rooftop bar. The only two people remaining are the waitress/bartender named Sylvia and a male patron, who is cleaning his revolver in front of her. As Sylvia slyly handles the revolver, the two talk of its intended use to kill the man's wife. As the two tango with the revolver in Sylvia's possession, they speak about who will be the one to pull the trigger. The man is planning on hiring a professional, Sylvia who volunteers to be that professional. But as the man poses the rhetorical question of who would hire a woman to be a hit man, Sylvia provides him with an answer.
