Privateer

 You play a Privateer in Wing Commander's universe trying to stay alive and make a living in treacherous space where you have to fight pirates deliver cargo, eliminate retro threats and scout unexplored territory. Until an unexpected fight on the far end of space leaves an unaimed torpedo at a previously undiscovered alien drone.
