The Day I Tried to Live

 A space pod crashes from the sky and a body washes up on a Spanish shore line, so begins a tale of one man's journey of discovery. The sea is hostile, the place a paradise, and the people are strange. Far from ordinary he experiences happiness, woes and alienation in his time here. Unfortunately he did not come alone; ghosts of past, fears haunt his every step. A tangible hope and search to find another of his kind turns to desperation as the fading sun quickly descends. As the sunsets the man had lived a lifetime in a day.
