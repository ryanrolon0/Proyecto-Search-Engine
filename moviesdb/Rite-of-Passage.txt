Rite of Passage

 Body Piercing is an in-depth look at the practice of piercing the body and its meanings to different people around the world. The film takes us from the fashionable, youth-oriented body piercing fad found in the US to the most remote parts of Africa and South Asia, where piercing the body represents such things as religious devotion and tribal identity.
