Tudor Rose

 King Henry VIII doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve, he carries it with him in the emblem of the Tudor Dynasty a red rose. Love for him is a seasonal cycle. His first wife Katherine of Aragon knows her bloom has faded and is forced to watch him pursue the affections of her alluring lady in waiting Anne Boleyn. But even Anne experiences the withering of the rose, when Henry once more turns his eyes to another woman and offers her the Tudor Rose.
