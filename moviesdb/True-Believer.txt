True Believer

 Ana Montes, known to her coworkers as the "Queen of Cuba" because of her quick rise through the ranks of Latin American specialists, became the intelligence community's top analyst on Cuban affairs. Montes had security clearance to all U.S. Top Secret information regarding defense strategies and operations. Considered an overachiever by everyone at the Pentagon throughout her sixteen-year career, Montes sent Fidel Castro some of America's most closely guarded secrets while at the same time influenced what the United States thought it knew about Cuba.
