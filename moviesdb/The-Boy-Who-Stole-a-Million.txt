The Boy Who Stole a Million

 A young lad working in a bank in Valencia 'borrows' a million pesetas so he can help his dad pay to get his taxi fixed. Instead he finds himself being chased all over town not only by the police but also by a selection of the local low-life after the cash. Paco, a 12-year-old boy working in a Valencia bank as a runner, decides to 'borrow' money from the bank in order to pay the repair bill on his father's taxicab, since this is the time of the annual festival and a time when his father can make some money. Soon, a bread-munching bank clerk slowly realizes that the bank has been robbed and is missing about a million dollars. Before Paco can reach his father, the police and a diverse collection of crooks and characters start searching for him. Among Paco's adventures in the underworld, the most frightening involves a life-or-death escape from a lunatic blind-beggar. His father, Miguel, is also searching for him aided by Maria, a waitress, and Luis, an auto-repairman. While filmed entirely in Spain, with an international cast, the dialogue is in English, with no subtitles in the UK/USA 84-minutes versions.
