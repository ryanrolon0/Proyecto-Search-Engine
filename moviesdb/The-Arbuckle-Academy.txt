The Arbuckle Academy

 The Arbuckle Academy tells the story of Drake Arbuckle and his sidekick, Todd Burrows, who embark on a harebrained quest to win back Drake's old tennis academy, now in the hands of his evil ex-wife, Marge, and his arch nemesis, President of Tennis Canada Brewster Coleman. Drake challenges Marge, and her new all-star girls' squad, to a tournament, his school versus her school, winner take the academy. The only problem is, Drake doesn't have a school. He has two weeks to whip his ragtag bunch of tennis wannabes into shape; convince his old friend, washed-up former pro Ragge Harlan, to play again; and find out what it takes to be a true champion.
