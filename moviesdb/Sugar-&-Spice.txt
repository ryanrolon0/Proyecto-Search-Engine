Sugar & spice

 After graduating from high school, Shiro is clueless how to proceed with his education. For the moment, he takes a small job at a local gas station, to much displease of his parents. His America-idolizing grandmother however gives Shiro all support, as she believes that "gas stations are a romantic place for wanderers". Grandmother is right about romance, when a girl called Noriko comes to work at the gas station too, after she broke up with her boyfriend. Shiro develops a huge crush on Noriko, and with this bitter-sweet first love, Shiro enters maturity.
