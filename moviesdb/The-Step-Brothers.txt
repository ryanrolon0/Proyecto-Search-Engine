The Step Brothers

 Ned Kerr and his step-brother Joe, lived with their mother. Mrs. Kerr, and all seemed happy enough except for the friction between the boys in the matter of loving Jane Samuels, the local express agent's daughter. To Joe it seemed that Jane cared more for Ned and his heart was sad. The two boys were rival candidates for the office of sheriff and after the election Joe is given three cheers as the new sheriff. Ned's frame of mind is anything but pleasant. Joe desires to reign in favor of Ned, but this is not sanctioned by the manager. Ned gives way to his bitter disappointment, discards the love of Jane, and leads a life of dissipation. In an intoxicated condition he is made the scapegoat for a hold-up of the express agent and he would have an awful time to prove himself innocent. So Joe furnished him with fund to start a new start in an unknown territory and then Joe gives himself up as the perpetrator of the crime. The express agent, however, vehemently denies this, as he is confident he can identify his assailants, one of whom is brought at this moment. Jane is pleased with the conduct of Joe and when their eyes meet, each reach in the expression of the other the evidence of true love.
