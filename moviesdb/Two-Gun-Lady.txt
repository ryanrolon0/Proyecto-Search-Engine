Two-Gun Lady

 Trick-shot artist Kate Masters, billed as "The Two-Gun Lady" begins an engagement at "Big Mike" Dougherty's saloon, and immediately arouses the jealousy and suspicion of his sweetheart, Bess. Among those attracted to Kate are Dan Corbin, a U. S. Marshal posing as a drifter, and Ben Ivers, outlaw son of crooked town-boss Jud Ivers. Ben has returned to hide his loot from the robbery of a federal bank. Kate learns that the Ivers were the men who had killed her father and mother and burned their house years ago. She tell Corbin and he heads for the Ivers' ranch to arrest Ben. Meanwhile, Ben is heading for the saloon for a showdown, fast-draw shootout with Kate. Karen Marshall arrives in the town controlled by Jud Ivers posing as Kate Masters. Her traveling companion taught her to shoot and she puts on her sharpshooting act at the saloon. But her main objective in returning is to find and kill the man that murdered her mother when she was a girl. That man is Ivers' son and when her true identity becomes known she is ready to face him in a gunfight.
