The Newcomers

 When Fred keeps getting a busy signal instead of his girlfriend Lori, he decides to check on her. Sure enough, she's cheating - with another woman! While Fred samples the competition, Lori storms downstairs and gives her daughter's boyfriend a music lesson on top of the piano. Then her daughter arrives but has to wait her turn. Frustrated and dripping at the top of the stairs, she grabs Fred and gets him to hose down her nubile flames. These insatiable lovers continue to probe each other's fantasies and in the end, the girls find their men are good to the last drop!
