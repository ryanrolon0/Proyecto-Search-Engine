The Young and the Guilty

 'The eighth deadly sin is to see evil where none exists ...' So young schoolboy Eddie Marshall believes. The son of an ambitious mother who believes she married beneath her, and a father considered stupid and selfish by his nagging wife, Eddie has always found peace and satisfaction in his studies. And then he meets Sue - shy, dreamy and well-to-do - a fellow pupil at his school, and the two fall deeply in love. Each day they write long, poetic letters, but when Sue's father finds and reads one of the letters he immediately jumps to the wrong conclusion.
