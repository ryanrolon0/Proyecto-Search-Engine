The Wailing Well

 The Wailing Well is a classic English ghost story on the theme of retribution. Set in 1920s England, three boy scouts find themselves separated from their troop on a county hike. True characters soon emerge, but the scout who refuses to play by the rules has more to fear than being lost as his wrongs are addressed at The Wailing Well.
