Sigappu Rojakkal

 Kamal Haasan, the central character, is a man terribly soured by his unvaryingly devastating encounters with the opposite sex. He develops a pathological hatred for women and uses his charm to seduce young women and kill them immediately after having sex with each. These proceedings are recorded watched repeatedly by his adoptive father and mentor, another crazed woman-hater with a similarly disillusioning experience with the female sex, who vicariously enjoys his protege's exploits. The old man stays holed up in a far corner of the house watching his son carry out what he is too infirm to do.
