The Arm

 An out-of-work photographer finds a severed arm in the woods and brings it home. When his girlfriend finds out about his discovery, the two get into a long-winded argument about their relationship. Before the night is over, someone will propose marriage, someone will find their long-lost cat... and someone will be dead.
