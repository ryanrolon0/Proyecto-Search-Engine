The Cold Rage of Makalu

 The film uses the forms of documentary filmmaking to create a take on the crisis of masculinity as caused by a mountain that is both powerful and camp at the same time. It skillfully dissects the megalomania it presents while casting a self-reflexive glance at its own modes of presentation. This makes it both an intelligent deconstruction of heroic myths and a hilarious satire, especially through the brilliant performance by Christian Schwanenberger and the equally brilliant music by Hamburg-based Punk Rock outfit "Oma Hans".
