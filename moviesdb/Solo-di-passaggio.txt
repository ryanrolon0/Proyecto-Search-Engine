Solo di passaggio

 A young soldier comes back home after a war mission in Middle East. He's pale and tired and doesn't show any particular emotion. He's with a colleague, a woman, which is rather cold and silent waiting for him while he's in the house with his mother. At first sight this visit is quite strange, as it seems that he doesn't belongs to that situation
