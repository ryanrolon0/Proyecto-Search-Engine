The Possessed

 The belief in possession by evil spirits plagued the darkness of the 18th century. Madness and hysteria spread, classifying the cripples and mentally ill as "Being under the control of the Devil". These misfits became the victims of bizarre exorcisms or " Casting Out Rituals". Banished and removed from society they were locked away inside brutal asylums. Left helpless, alone and afraid they were branded "The Possessed".
