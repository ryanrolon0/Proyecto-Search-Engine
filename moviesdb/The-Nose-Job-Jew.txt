The Nose Job Jew

 Tim is a Jew who doesn't feel he looks Jewish enough, and does as much as he possibly can to appear closer to his ethnic heritage. Complications arise when he starts dating Maya, a girl who's only interested in non-Jews despite her parents' efforts to get her to date a nice Jewish boy.
