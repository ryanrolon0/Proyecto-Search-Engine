The Deposition

 When a man accidentally causes a car wreck that kills his former lover, his life is derailed and his mind is splintered with guilt and the subsequent uncertainty about what exactly happened. Now, a shell of his former self, he must piece together his identity, escape the harsh judgment of the community, and reconcile conflicting court testimonies of others involved in the events that lead to that tragic night.
