 Sexgunsmoney@20 is an intense, funny and visceral story about excesses, instant gratification, greed and power, filled with intrigue and Machiavellian plotting. The five main characters are 20-year-olds who are close friends and always hang out together at each others' homes and at their favorite coffeehouse. Ruled by instant gratification and material desires, they plot to steal a Napoleon collection from one of their parents' homes. And this is how the story unravels.
