Proposal for an Unmade Film

 Shot on the island of Lanzarote Proposal for an unmade film (set in the future) weaves together the extraordinary, shattered, volcanic landscape of the Timonfaya National Park and the 'retro-futuristic' utopian architecture of artist Cesar Manrique. Proposal... implies that it is assembled from 'location recce' and audition footage; the by-product of a pre-production process for a low budget science fiction film/architectural documentary, developed this far, abandoned, and only later discovered in an archive. The suggested narrative that emerges from this found footage is that of a visitor attempting to create a paradise on earth - a story apparently influenced by Nick Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth - in which volcanic bubbles become time capsules, buildings become space ships and sculptural mobiles become radio antenna.
