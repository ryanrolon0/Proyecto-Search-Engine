Virodhi

 Police Inspector Shekar is assigned the case of apprehending people behind the drug cartel and smuggling. After an investigation, he finds out that the brains behind this is Badrinath Pandey, a politician who has strong ties with gangsters. Shekar arrests him, and holds him in prison to be tried for a variety of criminal offences. This is when Shekar finds out that justice works differently for people like Pandey, and as a result Pandey is released from prison, without being charged, and Shekar is suspended. Now without his uniform, Shekar and his family become targets of Pandey, the police, and the gangsters.
