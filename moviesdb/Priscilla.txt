Priscilla

 Priscilla is Manhattan satire about a mother who insists her shy daughter, PRISCILLA, get a nose job. The mother persuades Priscilla to visit a renowned, but creepy, plastic surgeon for a consultation where Priscilla is intrusively examined. After the consultation, Priscilla becomes more and more reluctant about the surgery and agitated with her mother. However, she finds no sympathy, even from her best friend. When the day of the surgery arrives, Priscilla refuses to go. When her mother insists and threatens her with consequences, Priscilla takes matter into her own hands, literally.
