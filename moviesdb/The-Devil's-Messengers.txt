The Devil's Messengers

 Jerry Wilson is a young high school student who happens to have paranoid schizophrenia. The film is centered around him and his journey to tell the world about the voice of God that he has heard in his head. At the same time he tries to act sane enough to impress the girl that he's been crushing on for the past 2 months. The object of the film is to inform people of paranoid schizophrenia and other mental illness'. In 2008 Illinois was ranked 51st in developmental disability funding - behind the District of Columbia. We are trying to spread awareness.
