Built using a combination of advanced and traditional construction techniques, the hall is already receiving rave reviews worldwide. Experience the dual drama of the preparation of the building and the staging of the first Canadian production of Wagner's monumental Ring Cycle. Raising Valhalla profiles Architect Jack Diamond and the Canadian Opera Company's late General Director and internationally renowned Conductor, Richard Bradshaw, as they scale new heights in their already remarkable careers.
