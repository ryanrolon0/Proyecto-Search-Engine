Un homme perdu

 UN HOMME PERDU stars Melvil Poupaud as Thomas KorE, a French photographer who travels around the world for his research about extreme experiences. During his travels, he crosses paths with Fouad Saleh - played by British-Sudanese actor Alexander Siddig - a solitary and amnesic man. Saleh disappeared from Beirut 17 years ago and never returned. Intrigued, KorE tries to discover the history of this man, and the experience changes him forever. The history and especially the character of Thomas KorE is strongly inspired by the photographic wanderings of Antoine d'Agata, the set consultant for Danielle Arbid.
