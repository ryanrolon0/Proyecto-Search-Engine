The Mission Trail

 In this Traveltalk short, preceded by "Visiting Vera Cruz (No.T715)" and followed by "Looking at London (No.T717)", the tireless James A. FitzPatrick follows the route laid out by the famous chain of 21 Spanish missions, begun in 1769 and extending northward for over 500 miles, from San Diego to Sonoma, California. He stops over briefly at San Luis Rey, San Juan Capistrano (to watch the Swallows) and San Juan Bautista before heading eastward to take a look at London.
