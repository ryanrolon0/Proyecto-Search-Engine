Rambling 'Round Radio Row #2

 Coming back from a Ocean trip to New York, Loyce Whiteman, Harry Barris and Art Jarrett decide to visit composer Burton Lane, who is also aboard to rehearse a little. Saxophonists Benny Krueger and Rudy Wiedhoeft meet and joke with their instruments, also commenting on prohibition. Songstress Sylvia Froos is singing at home while reading the paper. When she reads a story about a new scandal involving another young performer, she is glad that the press will never find out about her new pyjamas, but then a reporter shows up from under her bed.
