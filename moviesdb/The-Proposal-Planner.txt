The Proposal Planner

 Sarah Pease has a unique job helping wealthy men plan elaborate wedding proposals. From a moonlight picnic under the Eiffel Tower to a highly choreographed restaging of the moment the couple first met, Sarah's spectacular proposals cost between 10 and 50 thousand dollars and take between a week to a month to carefully craft, create and coordinate. In each half hour episode, we'll watch Sarah and her team make one couple's dream come true culminating in a one-of-a-kind proposal to remember.
