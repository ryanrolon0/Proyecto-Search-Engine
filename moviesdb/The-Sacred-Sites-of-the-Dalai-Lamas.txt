The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas

 On this fascinating journey you will explore the caves where the early Buddhist masters achieved enlightenment, enter the monasteries where the early Dalai Lamas and the founders of Buddhism meditated and taught, and - at an altitude of over 16,000 feet - look into the remarkable Oracle Lake where every Dalai Lama has had prophetic visions.
