The Singer and the Dancer

 An older woman does not speak to her daughter and detests everything about her. The only solace is with her regular visits to the doctor who drops her off along the road to spend her day in the countryside alone. One day at her favorite place in the country the older lady meets a young girl who is having relationship problems with her boyfriend, and they share their bitter memories. These meetings become regular therapeutic sessions.
