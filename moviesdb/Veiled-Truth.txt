Veiled Truth

 Runaway Carolyn 'Angie' Owens and NYPC detective Kim M. are the bait in an NYPD entrapment where pimp Jake's brother Duane gets killed. Eleven years later, Jake is released from jail and seeks revenge. Carolyn is now married to unsuspecting senator Andy Logan, the devoted father of teenage jock Josh, in Spokane, Washington. Jake has already driven Kim to suicide (o staged it) and blackmails Carolyn. First for money, then to be visiting Russian mob baron Victor Graznev's escort 'once only'.
