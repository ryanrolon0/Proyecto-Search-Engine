The Hindoo Fakir

 A remarkable and mystifying picture, showing a Hindoo Fakir going through a series of tricks. He produces a lovely woman by simply waving his hand in the air. He then sticks four swords in the platform and lays the woman at full length upon their upright handles, and then with a fifth sword, he knocks the four from under her and they mysteriously disappear, but the woman stays in her original position, apparently suspended in mid-air with nothing but the atmosphere as a support. A set of butterlfy wings seems to grow on her shoulders, and she flies about the stage in a most mysterious manner and then fades away in space.
