The Sting II

 Lonigan is planning to get back at Gondorf and Hooker for bilking him out of half a million. At the same time Gondorf and Hooker are planning their next caper. And their mark is a man named Macalinski, who makes Lonigan look like a pussycat. There con is boxing match and Hooker is the fighter whom they have to make look good but Macalinski needs some convincing, and Hooker is a little rusty. Hooker and Gondorf pull a con on Macalinski, an especially nasty mob boss with the help of Veronica, a new grifter. They convince this new victim that Hooker is a somewhat dull boxer who is tired of taking dives for Gondorf. There is a ringer. Lonigan, their victim from the first movie, is setting them up to take the fall.
