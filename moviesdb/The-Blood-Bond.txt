The Blood Bond

 A world-renowned spiritual leader arrives in the Asian nation of Purma to give a teaching to the faithful. Accompanying him is a retinue of monks and attendants, including his personal bodyguard, Deva, a beautiful Eurasian girl with extraordinary physical prowess. As soon as Bagwun and his party reach their hotel, they are attacked by assassins from a rebel terrorist group. Wounded, Bagwun needs to undergo a life-saving operation within twelve hours. However, his blood type is so rare that only a few donors can be found who can reach the capital in time to help. Rebel leader Lompoc obtains the same information, and has his agents kill off the donors one-by-one. Deva gets information about a possible 7th donor in a remote village in the North, and she decides to brave the dangerous journey alone into the guerrilla-held badlands. There, she finds the last possible donor whose blood can save Bagwun operative named John Tremayne. In a war-torn Asian land, peace lies in the hands of the Bagwun, a revered religious leader. When he is wounded in an assassination attempt, his sworn protector, Deva, sets out on a dangerous journey to find the one man who can provide the rare blood type needed to save her master's life. The potential donor is John Tremayne (Biehn), an embittered form US Special Forces operative. Together, this unlikely pair must run the gauntlet laid down by rebel leader Lompoc (Yam) and his aide Guang Di (Pei).
