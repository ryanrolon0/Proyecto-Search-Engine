The Boat That Ian Built

 The amazing success story of the Laser, a thirteen-foot sailboat built by Ian Bruce of Pointe Claire, QuEbec, and of Performance Sailcraft, the company he formed to produce and market it. Simply designed, durably built of fiberglass, it is a pleasure craft that has brought summer sailing within everyone's reach on coastal and inland waters around the world.
