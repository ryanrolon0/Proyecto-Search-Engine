The Hard Life

 Centers on parents Bobby and Gina. Bobby is charming and witty and tries to be a good father and a good husband but finds it hard to be both things at the same time. Gina is a caring, well-intentioned but tightly-wound former career woman-turned-full-time mom who is overprotective of her girls.
