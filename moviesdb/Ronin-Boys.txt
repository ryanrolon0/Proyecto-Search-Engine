Ronin Boys

 Evan's tame corporate days are over. Newly initiated into a powerful society of Asian Mobsters, Evan Young is suddenly embroiled in a world of fast money and fast times. His friend and leader of the sect, Shingo, is a rising star in the Triad Society. Together, along with the reluctant but reliable Lee, crooked cop Janus, and loose-cannon Gin, the boys fight, extort, and connive their way up the underworld ladder. Meanwhile, Shingo's Boss, Brother Ming, has a dilemma. He has been promoted to join the inner circle in Hong Kong, and must choose a successor. Will he turn over control of the American Branch to his reckless nephew Vinny, or will he disregard traditional bloodlines and choose Shingo instead? As the bickering for the seat of power escalates, a mission to Las Vegas turns deadly, and now the only way out is an all-out war. Desperate to escape the monotony of the corporate world, Evan follows his friend, Shingo into a mysterious Triad Society. Shingo introduces Evan to his band of misfits including Lee - a gangster with a guilty conscience, Gin - a loose cannon, and Janus - a cop with an unconventional sense of justice. He soon joins the boys in their adventures in a world of perpetual danger, tests of loyalty, and power struggles. Along the way, they encounter rivals, businessmen, and beautiful women, and experience friendship, love and loss, as they come to realize the rewards and perils of the life they have chosen.
