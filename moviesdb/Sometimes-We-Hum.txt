Sometimes We Hum

 Drawing on social and racial stereotypes "Sometimes We Hum", is a story of one man dealing with the frustrations of urban living. Ex- Marine, W.A. Richards wants nothing more than to enjoy a peaceful evening at home. When his obnoxious, rude neighbor makes that impossible, Richards takes command of the situation in an unexpected and most delightful way.
