Second Skin

 A visual study on memory, alienation and innocence by first time filmmaker and visual artist Juno Doran, using film to explore her own identity and roots, as the links with her past disappear. There is no narrative and the film is charged with visual content, allowing the viewers to be taken through the different stages of a personal journey into the past, present and future, in a free and uncompromising way, resulting in a possible metaphor for the journey of life itself.
