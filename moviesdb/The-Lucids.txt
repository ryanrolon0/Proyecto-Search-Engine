The Lucids

 Pablo, a homesick salsa dancing instructor, decides to believe he has contracted HIV without getting tested. Things get more complicated for Pablo when Danny, an abusive intellectual, and Leo, his mother's freeloading ex-husband, move in with him. Danny and Leo engage in intellectual debates and jointly take advantage of a hero who chooses not to fight back because, as dysfunctional as it may be, he now has a family. Inspired by true events and featuring a non professional cast acting as themselves, 'The Lucids' is a sardonic tragicomedy that follows the journey of a soul trying to keep its purity in an absurd world.
