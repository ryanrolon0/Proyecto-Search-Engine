The Magus

 A multi-format, process-based experimental film that explores the root of artistic creation. The film documents visual artist, C. Graham Asmundson's body of work over a rigorous six-month period. Filmmaker, Jaimz Asmundson, Graham's son, uses cinematography and editing as magical weapons to ritualistically birth, destroy and resurrect his father's work. Through psychedelic imagery and machine-gun editing, the resulting film is a stylized, hyper-kinetic, cinematic manifestation of the Asmundsons' personal exploration of occult ceremonies and experiences. Working this uncommon practice, the father/son team explore mind-altered states and invoke unnatural resurrections; where unforeseen demons and other spiritual forces are often released.
