The Fake Prophet

 'The Fake Prophet' is a Nollywood film that has been produced as an advocacy tool by the UK based child rights charity, Stepping Stones Nigeria, producers of the Channel4 dispatches documentary 'Saving Africa's Witch Children'. We have collaborated with well renowned Nigerian film director, Teco Benson, to produce the film. 'The Fake Prophet' follows two parallel stories. One follows a young girl who has been branded a witch, and the other tells of a fraudulent Pastor who claims to have power bestowed by God to identify and exorcise witchcraft. The film illuminates the harsh reality faced by children stigmatized as witches, while also exposing the truth behind those who make money by claiming to be prophets, able to seek out and exorcise child witches.
