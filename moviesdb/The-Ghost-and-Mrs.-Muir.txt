The Ghost and Mrs. Muir

 In 1900, strong-willed widow Lucy Muir goes to live in Gull Cottage by the British seaside, even though it appears to be haunted. Sure enough, that very night she meets the ghost of crusty former owner Captain Gregg...and refuses to be scared off. Indeed, they become friends and allies, after Lucy gets used to the idea of a man's ghost haunting her bedroom. But when a charming live man comes courting, Lucy and the captain must deal with their feelings for each other. Living in a haunted house by the sea is a less frightening prospect for Lucy Muir, a young widow with a small daughter, than continuing to live with her sisters-in-law. At first Captain Gregg plays the same tricks on Lucy he has used to get rid of previous tenants. This ghost who loves solitude soon comes to admire her spunk and to make it possible for her to afford to stay in the house he decides she will write a best-seller, his memoirs. When Lucy visits a London publisher, she also impresses a famous author of children's books, Miles Fairley. Can a ghost be jealous? An independent widowed woman Mrs. Muir (Gene Tierney) and her young daughter (Natalie Wood) in Victorian England, find a new life in a small English seaside town, and Gull Cottage. With this new lease of life comes a catch, an old sea dog named Capt. Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison) still resides there, but as a ghost, who won't let go his home. Coming to an arrangement, they learn to get along, just. All is not well, eventually, her finances become low and to make end's meet Lucy is forced to be ghostwriter to Captain Gregg's autobiography. In the meantime being charmed by cad Miles Fairley (George Sanders) who's only in it for the ride.
