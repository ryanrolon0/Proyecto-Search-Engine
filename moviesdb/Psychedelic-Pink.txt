Psychedelic Pink

 The Pink Panther discovers a door with an hypnotic eye that takes him on a mind trip in a psychedelic book shop adorned by huge letters of the alphabet and managed by a short, pointy-nosed hippie. The shop contains a vending machine for lights (a cigarette lighter and Christmas tree lights) and books that "bleed" letters when damaged and are operated on as though critically injured.
