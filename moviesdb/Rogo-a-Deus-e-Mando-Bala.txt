Rogo a Deus e Mando Bala

 Attempt to emulate the Italian-style western. Cowboy who is running away after a hold-up is attacked by robbers and gets hurt. He is helped by a widow and her mute son, to whom he trusts the stolen money to be hidden. But the bandits find him. When all seemed lost, there appears the strange figure of a rider and his inseparable guitar.
