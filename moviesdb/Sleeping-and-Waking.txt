Sleeping and Waking

 If you had a second chance at life, would you take it? Sullivan Daniels, an artist known for his extremely detailed and harsh religious paintings and woodcuts, opted for life when faced with terminal cancer. Modern medicine (in the not-too-distant future) has given him a second chance. But now he must deal with the consequences of his decision before... His wife can't bear to touch him..... And his pious mother believes he has thwarted God's will and should have accepted death and the promised life beyond. Having abandoned his faith, Sully must find his way back from the darkness of his life saving decision.
