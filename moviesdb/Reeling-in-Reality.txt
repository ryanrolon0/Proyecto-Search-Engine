Reeling in Reality

 In March of 2002, the top executives at the Fox Television Network met on a Monday morning, to exchange information about a new reality program rumored to be in production. The idea had all the makings of "the next big thing," and so a strategy was immediately hatched to acquire the show which was being produced by two young filmmakers, with the backing of a European financier. By April of 2002, production was halted on the show, with no finale in the can, and a police investigation pending. On the advice of counsel, the filmmakers refused to take any calls or answer any questions regarding their show. Since then, the story behind the show has become the stuff of Hollywood urban legend. Now, the producers behind TAKE MY WIFE...PLEASE!, are telling that story for the first time, in a film that goes behind the scenes, and recounts what took place during the making of the show. From the moment the initial seed was planted, through development, casting, and the tumultuous production, Ezra Landes takes filmgoers on a journey though the world of reality television, and demonstrates just how quickly two people can find themselves REELING IN REALITY.
