Razorhead

 Razorhead is the story of Ray, whose disastrous Valentine's Day present to his girlfriend leaves him cold and depressed. He sets out on a very unusual and unexpected journey through his inner fears and fantasies in order to hopefully find a solution to his relationship problem and maybe even find a certain self-awakening along the way... Part David Lynch homage, part musical, part horror, "Razorhead" is a dark surreal comedy unlike any other.
