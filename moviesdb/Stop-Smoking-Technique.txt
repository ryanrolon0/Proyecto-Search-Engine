Stop-Smoking Technique

 Queenie wants to kick her smoking habit, so her roommate, C.J., agrees to help. Her plan is to tie up her curly-haired roommate so she kicks the nicotine cravings by going cold turkey. Queenie is a resourceful addict, however and manages to find and smoke cigarettes she has stashed around the house despite the ropes and gags that constrict her. Rather than show some gratitude to her roommate when she finally manages to escape her bonds, Queenie places C.J. in even stricter bondage than she had to endure.
