Riisuminen

 One night Finnish cabinet minister (Saarela) runs into his old girlfriend from years back (Eloranta), an intelligent woman who has become a prostitute, yet remained loyal to the same political party the minister still represents. They book a hotel room and spend one night together drinking, having sex, and talking politics.
