The Dead Rose

 Bruce Duray exists in the eternal darkness of a paralyzing coma. His son Robby - now alone - is desperate to end his father's suffering. Robby's faith in God is strong, though it crumbles as he struggles with the moral and legal implications of euthanasia. Despair and desperation move Robby to rendezvous with an old friend of his father's - the eccentric owner of a retro theme park. Through him a decades old debt is cashed in and the life of Robby's father is taken. Now, accomplice to the murder and scorned, Robby turns from God - from his family - and from the sheltered world of his youth. The amusement park becomes Robby's home, and its owner - his father. Robby is drawn to the new life where he discovers a new family and a new way. But the mysterious influence of a single red rose unearths a dark secret that will change Robby's life forever, and place his fate in the hands of those he once loved, those he has betrayed... Now begins his greatest adventure.
