Queerantine!

 When reports break about students acting out of character, a TV reporter and police investigate. Students start behave with gay tendencies after same-sex marriage is taught in a social studies class. Things get out of control leaving the reporter and policemen to defend themselves against all of the queer students. Police decide to quarantine the school off so the gay can't spread, leaving the reporter trapped!
