The Rose Parade

 Celebrity host and former Grand Marshal William Shatner and perennial Rose Parade host Stephanie Edwards guide viewers on an entertaining journey through the history of America's greatest parade. They explore the magic of Pasadena's annual New Year's Day celebration with featured segments on the Royal Court, famous Grand Marshals, colorful marching bands and awe-inspiring parade floats. This family program covers not only the history and the grandeur of this very special American tradition, but also pays tribute to the hundreds of volunteers who bring the event to life each year.
