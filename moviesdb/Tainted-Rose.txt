Tainted Rose

 Angelo and Ariana are childhood sweethearts who rely on each other as kids to survive their stressful situations at home. As they grow older, Angelo has his sights set on being a successful box office Hollywood director, while Ariana struggles back at home searching for a worthwhile life for herself outside of working to support her family as a local popular stripper, and saving herself awaiting Angelo's return. After living separate lifestyles for many years, their paths unexpectedly cross when Angelo takes a break from the rigors of Hollywood to return to his small hometown to visit a few friends. Angelo realizes his reunion with Ariana is not coincidental and tries to convince her to walk away from her stagnant life there and return with him to Los Angeles, believing in his heart that she still has feelings for him as he has for her. Will Angelo finally be able to fill the void in his life Ariana brings, or will her family obligations and new relationship with Angelo's former childhood best friend, Derek, who feels Ariana now belongs to him, stand in their way?
