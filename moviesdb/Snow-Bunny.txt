Snow Bunny

 "Snow Bunny" is a triptych of scenes spanning a day in the life of an American family. Dean and Abigail are having a "grown-up party." Abigail asks Dean to take their daughters, Mandy and Delilah, out for an afternoon drive so she can get ready. While out, Dean makes some decisions that will effect his daughters for a long time to come. Upon his return, Abigail tries to connect with Dean to get him in the partying mood. Thwarted by both Delilah's quest for attention and Dean's hostility, Abigail loses her cool and fights with Dean. Later that night, after the guests have left, Dean and Abigail stay up drinking cocktails and talking. Abigail continues her attempts to connect with Dean by bringing up the past. The push and pull of their interactions leads to an awkward expression of passion born out of an unhappy mixture of obligation and devotion.
