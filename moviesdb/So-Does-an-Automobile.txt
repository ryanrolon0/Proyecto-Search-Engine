So Does an Automobile

 Betty is a nurse in a hospital for sick and injured automobiles. She is both nurse and a mechanic as she ministers to her patients, who go through all the actions and complaints of human patients. Betty sings as she restores broke-down taxicabs, high-price limousines and restores a police car with sore and flat feet (tires)back to perfect condition again.
