The Red Kite Project

 What is autism? How does it affect those who have it and their families? How can we bring those with autism more into the mainstream of our communities? And what role can the arts play in all of their lives? More than three years in the making, this inspiring film by award-winning filmmaker Kerry Shaw Brown captures the incredible journey of artists, educators, parents and most importantly children as they set out to create the first-of-its-kind interactive, multi-sensory theatrical performance installation for children on the autism spectrum. Having spent 13 years volunteering in classrooms of children with autism, Jacqueline Russell, Artistic Director of Chicago Children's Theatre set out to assemble a team of people from a wide range of disciplines to bring joy, excitement and educational experiences to those who really needed it. And as their experiences and learnings spread across the U.S. and the world, the results are changing the landscape for children with autism, their families and caregivers. A must see film for all those who have had autism touch their lives. Available on Amazon. Special features Menu. Running time
