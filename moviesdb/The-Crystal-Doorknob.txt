The Crystal Doorknob

 A young boy, VICTOR, and his older sister, CHANTELLE, listen to their grandfather's bedtime story about a boy who discovers a door with a crystal doorknob. When he opens the door, he is sucked into oblivion and this door is believed to be in their own basement. Chantelle persuades a frightened Victor to sneak down there and find out the truth. While in the strange basement, Chantelle locks Victor in a cellar. As Victor cries for help he is silenced by the sound of a voice calling to him. He turns around to find a door with a Crystal Doorknob.
