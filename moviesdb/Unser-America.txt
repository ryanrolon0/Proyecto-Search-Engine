 "Nicaragua was the Vietnam of my generation" The filmmaker returns to neoliberal Nicaragua, battered by war and corruption years previously had offered one of the last social utopias that was the rallying point for thousands from around the world. There was a hope that the small country would be able to triumph over poverty and discrimination within a system of political plurality, a mixed economic system, and remain independent of world political blocks beat Goliath. The film returns to the past and attempts to cautiously sense a path forwards in a new unknown situation the current state of affairs. In the middle point are women who had taken up arms years ago, and how they now struggle to survive today. What remains from the dream for independence and justice?
