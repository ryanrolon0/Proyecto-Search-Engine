Song of Texas

 Now poor, Sam Bennett was a rodeo star in his younger days. When Roy learns Sam told his daughter he owned a ranch and she is arriving for a visit, Roy has him pose as the owner of his ranch. Learning her father and Roy are partners, she forces them to sign a legal document. They plan to tear it up when she leaves but using her power of attorney, she sells her fathers half of the ranch. A man of no worth brags to his daughter back East that he is rich and owns a big ranch. When she decides to pay a visit to her father, Roy and his buddies agree to pretend that the poor man is the owner of the ranch. Songs include "Mexicali Rose," "Rainbow Over the Range," and "Moonlight and Roses."
