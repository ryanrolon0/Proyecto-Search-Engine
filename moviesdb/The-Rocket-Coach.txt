The Rocket Coach

 "A very pretty picture of country life in Old England. In the background is a typical roadside inn at Burford. Up comes the Rocket Coach with a jolly crowd aboard; the four horses galloping, and horns blowing. They stop in front of the inn, and the grooms come out with a change of horses."
