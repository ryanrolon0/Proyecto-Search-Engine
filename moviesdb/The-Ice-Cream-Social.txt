The Ice Cream Social

 The Ice Cream Social updates the classic variety show format, blends in aspects of the talk show format, and envelops the whole in comedy. Combining elements of Laugh-In, American Bandstand, Ed Sullivan, and Charlie Rose, the Ice Cream Social is a weekly hour-long party with an ensemble cast of regulars and an ever-changing array of guests and performers.
