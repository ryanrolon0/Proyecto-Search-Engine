Reinventing Detroit

 Detroit, Michigan. A city with a rich history of industry and music, now a city hit hard with economic depression and unemployment. However, one new industry in the state is breathing life and giving hope to the area. Film. The Michigan Film Incentive is responsible for bringing 69 films to the state in 2009, and more slated for 2010. 'Reinventing Detroit' is a film about how a city can take those that were employed in the automotive industry and giving them a new opportunity, a fresh start. It speaks from the perspective of the hardworking Detroiter. It is a film of rebirth and renaissance and most important, hope. See Detroit as you never have expected it to be. See Detroit... in the movies.
