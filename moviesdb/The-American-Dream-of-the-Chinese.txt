The American Dream of the Chinese

 The stories of six Chinese citizens who came to the United States over the last 30 years. They live by six versions of the American Dream geophysicist, who was among the first 50 students and scholars China sent to study in the United States after 30 years of frozen relations between the two countries; a former Red Guard and now a writer who served as Chairman Mao's foot soldier; a musician trying to find his niche market in America; a community leader believing in Martin Luther King's dream; an illegal immigrant, who gave up a respectful life for one that faces constant exploitation; and a college student seeking to challenge American uncertainties.
