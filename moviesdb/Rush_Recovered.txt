Rush_Recovered

 Ted 11-11 works for the Mother Board transferring files from one place in the construct to another (eg. copy paste). We follow Ted through his journey as he delivers files to zany characters. All the while, the ever increasing speed, available updates, upgrades, spam and glitches are making daily life for Ted unbearable. Is complete disconnection from the system Ted's only option for freedom?
