Quarante

 Quarante is the portrait of a woman. Christel, soon to be 40 years old, is filmed by her companion. The movie goes through her stories, her experiments and her works as a director (a documentary about women, a japanese fiction feature with Fabienne Babe). As the movie progresses, it goes deeper into the intimacy of her life, her fantasies, and her relationship with her lover which gets more and more difficult. Quarante is a mix of interviews, stories, raw slices of raw life, impromptu meetings, fictions. It's about sexuality, cinema, and memories. Raw, surprising, exciting and often funny.
