Trolley Ahoy

 The terrible tempered Mr. Bang is commuting to work. When the trolley takes more than 5 seconds to arrive, he follows the tracks to the Skipper's house, where he bets him $10 he won't get to work on time. So motivated, the Skipper cuts breakfast short, but he hasn't paid the bill and his power is off. His wife rigs a sail, which gets him going, but a typhoon blows them off course. They land atop Mr. Bang's train. A tunnel knocks the trolley off the train and Mr. Bang into the train but he hasn't paid the $10 bet. The Skipper's wife, Powerful Katrinka, reels in the railroad track to bring the train back, then gets the $10 from Mr. Bang.
