Puddle Pranks

 Flip pulls up at his girlfriend's house in a cricket-drawn carriage. They play the harmonica and they ride along until they are attacked by a pelican. The cricket is eaten, but Flip and his girl escape. They then go swimming in a nearby swimming hole. The pelican spots them and tries again to eat them, but is swallowed by a giant fish when he dives in the water.
