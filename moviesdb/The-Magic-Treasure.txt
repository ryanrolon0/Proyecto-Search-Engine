The Magic Treasure

 A gentle giant lives in a small village and has a beautiful flower garden where the children of the town play. In the giant's house rests a small treasure box. Every so often, the giant, asks the children a riddle, "What do you think is the one thing that makes people so very special?" If one of the children answers correctly the giant's magic treasure box will open. As time goes on one of the giants favorite children, Hans, gives the box to a greedy wizard. The giant goes after the box and brings it back as Hans learns an important lesson which suddenly opens the box.
