The Consequences of My Sins

 The cast and his friends go off to college, they feel like they've made it and on their way to productive, successful careers. But their lives begin to spiral out of control. Away from home and their parents for the first time, they get to make their own decisions, their own choices. But they quickly realize choices have consequences, some big, some small...some deadly. How you do what's right when everything around you is going wrong? How do you go on living when your heart is shattered into pieces? These are the questions they have to find the answers to - quick. Nothing in a classroom could ever prepare them for what was to come.
