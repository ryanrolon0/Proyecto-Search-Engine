The Fifth Missile

 The crew of a Polaris submarine, on a training mission simulating an attack on Russia, is stricken by toxic poisoning. One of the poison's effects is to make its victims hallucinate, and the sub's captain imagines that he has been given an order to actually attack Russia. He prepares to do exactly that. The government decides to run an exercise wherein the crew of a submarine will be lead to believe that a war has broken out and to see how they respond. Only the Captain, the First Officer, and a Psychiatrist are aware of what's going on. Just before going out to sea the sub was painted but unknown to them the paint was laced with a toxin that leads to whoever inhales to act irrationally and violently. But for some reason the First Officer is still rational but the Captain whom doesn't exactly get along with is almost deranged he can't reason with him.
