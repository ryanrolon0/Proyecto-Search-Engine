The Mysterious Stone Monuments of Markawasi Peru

 Strange faces and figures were discovered at 12,500' in the Andes Mountains of Central Peru. Many are recognizable as animals and icons from other parts of the world Island Moai. A research team, including Dr. Robert M. Schoch, paleontologist from Boston University, examines the 'statues' to determine if they were formed by erosion, or fashioned by an unknown ancient civilization. The rock surfaces are covered, says Dr. Schoch, with lichen that takes thousands of years to accumulate, suggesting that an unknown, sophisticated culture traveled the world and left their mark on Markawasi in the distant past. This is probably the only documentary that has ever been done about this amazing Peruvian Mystery.
