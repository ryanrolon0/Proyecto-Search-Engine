The Nurse

 Silvia is a 30-year-old nurse, who lives with her abusive mother. After being fired several times, she moves to New York City to start a new job in a reputable hospital. In a misplaced desire to show her mother she's a good nurse, Silvia places her patients in critical conditions in order to save them. Once their status is reported, she reaps the benefits. After the new chief finds out the truth, Silvia's violence explodes.
