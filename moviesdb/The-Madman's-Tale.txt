The Madman's Tale

 Francis Petrel, a former asylum patient, returns to the site of the now-closed institution which results in grisly flashbacks to dark events that once took place inside the hospital walls - the rape and murder of a young nurse late one night. Francis sets to tell the tale of the horrific crime never solved that has haunted him for twenty years which leads to the killer resurfacing.
