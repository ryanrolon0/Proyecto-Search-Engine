Sisifo

 A man is sitting at a table, reading a newspaper. He doesn't realize that the room he is in, has no doors at all and he doesn't pay attention to the strong noises coming from outside. Some blood drops out from his mouth. The man stands up and goes toward a mirror. He is bleeding from a tooth pulls the tooth out, he notices that the root's got a weird shape. From that moment on the man will start gain consciousness about the world surrounding him and about his "mission".
