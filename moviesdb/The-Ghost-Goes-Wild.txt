The Ghost Goes Wild

 Monty Crandall is a commercial artist who ridicules a dowager with a caricature of her on a magazine cover and she sues him. His troubles are multiplied when a pretty wife forces her attentions on him, and her gun-toting husband is somewhat incensed about it, blaming Monty. He fakes his death and returns as a ghost to frighten off the trouble-makers, but it is only when he enlists the aid of a real ghost, Eric, that his problems are solved.
