 Baruch is a 62 Years old security man who works six nights a week in a deserted parking lot on the outskirts of Tel-Aviv. As opposed to many others, Baruch chose this kind of life. At the age of 55 he left his successful business and since then he lives in the dark. This is a night in Baruch's life, a fascinating figure that chose to live differently.
