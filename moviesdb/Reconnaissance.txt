Reconnaissance

 You almost feel bad for the streets of New York as NIck Navy and Greg Grey take it to the edge, in this all out action packed thrill ride. Its a full throttle race against time through alley ways, up fire escapes and over every obstacle imaginable. With an action sequence free of mats, wires and special effects you won't know what hit you. Its all adrenaline and its all real.
