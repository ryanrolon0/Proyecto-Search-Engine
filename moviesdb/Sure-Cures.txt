Sure Cures

 A dramatization of the folly of home remedies, old wives' tales, and being one's own physician. Cures for baldness, insomnia, and the hiccups get comic portrayals as our hero's hairline recedes despite tonics and headstands; as Morpheus and the sandman fail to appear despite reading dull books, counting sheep, and wearing an eye mask; and, as various cures espoused by grandmothers and aunts, most involving water, fail to drown the hiccups. Folk remedies indeed.
