Revenge of the Creature

 The Creature from the Black Lagoon is back! This time he's captured by scientists and transported to an aquarium in south Florida. Naturally, he's attracted to the lovely female scientist and manages to escape and kidnap her, heading to Jacksonville, presumably to catch a Jaguars game. Scientists re-discover Creature! Creature discovers lust! The "Creature From The Black Lagoon" is back and this time he's shipped to Marineland in (north) Florida for study. While in the aquarium he spies the love of his life. Naturally, the creature escapes in pursuit of beauty, down the St. Johns River, all the way to Jacksonville where he kidnaps his love from a downtown waterfront hotspot (dig the neon skyline in the background).
