The End of The Beginning

 Geoff Wyman is almost 30. But 30 means he should grow up and get a real job, because working at The Chicken Shack won't cut it forever. Freshly dumped by his girlfriend, he moves to Queens, NY, and life in a boring bachelor's pad. That is, until he finally hooks up his phone and ... ring! But that first call is for Annie Danilov. The phone company screwed up by reassigning her old number too quickly. As Geoff is bombarded with calls for Annie, his imagination explodes. Who is she? Where is she? And why is one creepy caller so desperate to find her? But the police don't care, and the calls won't stop. Not until Geoff finds Annie. But does she want to be found?
