Student Occupation

 There comes a day when Yannis, a 12th-grader, is ready to tell Anna, a fellow student, how much he likes her. His plans will turn upside down when, that very day, he'll find the school under student occupation, and his Anna among the occupying protesters. A half-erased graffiti and a fussy tv-reporter will further complicate the story with twists and turns of Fors and Against.
