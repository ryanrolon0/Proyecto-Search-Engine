The Man Who Knew Bush

 George W. Bush, 43rd President of the United States, had a storybook life before arriving in office via a contentious 2000 election. Many Americans, however, are unaware of who, or more importantly, what, Bush pretends not to be blueblood. Fortunately, six months prior to the 2004 election, documentary filmmaker Marc Berlin discovered someone who did know these things Craig. Distantly related to the Bush's, and victim of a Dubya sucker-punch outside a New Haven bar in 1968, Craig agreed to be interviewed about his extensive knowledge of, and connection to, the Bush-Walker dynasty. Guiding us to those elite places and institutions which played a role in forming George W.'s right-wing politics--from the sprawling Walker estate in Kennebunkport to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and finally the ivied walls of Yale University and Skull and Bones--Vernon Craig, "The Man Who Knew Bush", wryly explains what George W. Bush is, and how, precisely, he became the most powerful man in the world.
