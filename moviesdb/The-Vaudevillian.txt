The Vaudevillian

 Jay, a recently fired ventriloquist, and his ventriloquist dummy, Chester, must survive during the Dust Bowl. When Jay decides to scam a farmer out of his money, Chester warns him of the danger of taking advantage of the less fortunate. Not heeding his dummy's good advice, Jay continues the scam. Realizing that he and Chester cannot coexist morally, Jay leaves him on the side of the road so that he will not have to acknowledge his bad behavior.
