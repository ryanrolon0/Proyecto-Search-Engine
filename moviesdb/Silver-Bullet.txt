 The small town of Tarker's Mill was a place that was very peaceful, where nothing ever happened. Until one night, murders begin. The town people believe its some maniac killer on the loose and intend to hunt the man down. Marty, a young handicapped boy, believes that the killer is no man at all, but a werewolf. After a run in with the werewolf Marty and his sister, Jane hunt all over town for the man who is the werewolf. The small city Tarker's Mill is startled by extreme sadistic murders. The population fears that this is the work of a maniac. During a search a mysterious, hairy creature is observed. This strange appearance is noticed once a month. People lock themselves up at night, but there's one boy who's still outside, he's preparing the barbecue. In the spring of 1976, in the former peaceful town Tarker's Mills, the inhabitants are scared with violent murders and press Sheriff Joe Haller to investigate further and find the responsible. Meanwhile, the crippled boy Marty is very happy with the new motorized wheelchair that his dear Uncle Red gave to him. During the night, Marty sneaks out to use the fireworks Red gave to him in a bridge. However he is attacked by a haired creature but Marty shots a rocket in the left eye of the attacker and escapes. Marty tells his sister Jane that he was attacked by a werewolf and convinces her to seek out who in town could have an injured eye. Jane discovers that the local Reverend Lowe is the creature but now the siblings have to convince Uncle Red to help them to disclose the truth about the reverend.
