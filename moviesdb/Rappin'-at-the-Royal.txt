Rappin' at the Royal

 The Theatre Royal has worked hard recently to involve "urban" voices in its productions, having its biggest success with "The Big Life", a musical about four young black men coming to England in the 1950's. Building on this success, the Theatre combine with Channel Four to bring together musicians, writers and two lecturers in Musical Theatre from NYU. The challenge to each group is to produce a ten minute piece using urban music and still fit with the structure of musicals. The groups break off with their different stories but the dynamics of each group produces different challenges and results.
