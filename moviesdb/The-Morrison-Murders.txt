The Morrison Murders

 A husband and wife and their youngest son are murdered in this true story. Their two other sons are left to cope with their loss, but the local sherrif begins to suspect that one of the brothers committed the crime, and must convince the other to help him discover the truth. Morrison Transport is a family owned trucking business based in Georgia. The Morrison parents, Garth and Flo, and their youngest son Bobby are found shot to death in their home. Luke Morrison, one of the Morrison's other sons who still lives in the house and drives for the business, was the one that found the bodies. Despite Garth having his fair share of enemies, Luke, and Garth and Flo's other son Walker Morrison who is also a driver for the business, are not ruled out as suspects. Walker in particular is high on the police's suspect list as it was known that Walker had a rocky relationship with his father, including a time when they were totally estranged from each other. The investigation shifts after Luke fails a polygraph test, and a shell casing found at the scene is from Luke's rifle. Further circumstantial evidence against Luke includes Luke being the sole beneficiary of his father's $200,000 life insurance policy (Bobby was the other named beneficiary), and that he seems slightly perturbed that a supposed new will excluding Walker from any inheritance was not executed. This entire situation places a strain between the brothers as well as between Walker and his wife Patti. Patti believes Luke is the killer but Walker doesn't know what to believe. Over the two years of the investigation, Walker just wants to know what the truth is so that he and Luke can come to an understanding.
