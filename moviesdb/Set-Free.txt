Set Free

 In this collection of true stories women and men tell on the miraculous journey from a dark place of human grief and shame toward the light of God's forgiveness and grace. Few people realize how many American women and men have participated in an abortion. Rarely will those affected by abortion seek counsel or find healing from this haunting memory. But there is hope and new life --- and amazingly incredible and unexpected JOY --- available for anyone who seeks God's true healing. You will be deeply moved and overwhelmed by God's love and compassion for every human soul --- and if you are captive to an oppressive memory you will find here the truth that you, too, can be Set Free.
