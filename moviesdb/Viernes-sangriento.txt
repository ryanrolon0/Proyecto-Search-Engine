Viernes sangriento

 What if you woke up one day and didn't remember what happened the night before? You know that you were drinking because your breath reeks of alcohol. Sometimes you remember flashes of something that might have happened. You still don't know the truth... Do you want to know it or is it something that's just too hard to accept? You wonder if you really killed all your friends or if it was all just a dream... or maybe a premonition of what might happen. How did it all start?
