Spycraft

 You are elite Central Intelligence officer, Agent Thorn. An agency mole is selling off secrets to the notorious Russian Mafia, and a secret underworld organization (PROCAT) is running a plot to hijack a nuclear warhead, and possibly to kill the United States President, all after a Russian Presidential candidate was assassinated at the dawn of the end of the nuclear ages with the signing of a historic treaty between Russia and the United States to permanently halt the arms race. Nobody knows who the PROCAT leader is, but it is up to you find out, unravel the assassination plot, discover the mole, and bring PROCAT down.
