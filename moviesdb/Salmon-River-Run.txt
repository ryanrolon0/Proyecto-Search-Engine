Salmon River Run

 Salmon River Run, shot entirely on New York State's world famous Salmon River, captures and embodies the spirit and spectacle of salmon fishing. Each fall, thousands of salmon and thousands of anglers converge on an 11-mile stretch of public fishing waters. The result is a furious battle between man and beast.
