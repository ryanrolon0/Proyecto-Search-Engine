The Faust Deal

 George and Daily Faust are horse-breeders in late 1800's California. When the horses no longer breed, their landlord Elliot Thomas still demands some method of compensation and begins terrorizing George and his wife. Devastated, George wanders into the woods and meets a strange man in black named Samiel who claims he can make all of George's problems go away. He asks for George's trust and the results are not what George expected.
