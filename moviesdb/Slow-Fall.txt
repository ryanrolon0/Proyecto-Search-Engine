Slow Fall

 Autumn is a particularly enthralling time of year for my eyes. The sky can be deep blue one day and cool, hazy gray the next. On any given day, the trees can range in color from blazing orange to deep crimson to bright green to screaming yellow. I have attempted to include all those colors in this video, as well as quivering rhythms that flow over branches and leaves like a soft autumn wind. How rapturous it is to see and sense every season of the year!
