The Last Shift

 The television documentary entitled The Last Shift is a portrait of the post-Soviet generation in their mid-twenties. Their childhood and youth saw perestroika and the end of the Soviet era. These people were raised in USSR but matured in other countries with a different set of values, ideology and political systems. The most interesting sample of this generation are people who spent their childhood in the best place the USSR could offer, the Artek pioneer camp, but then returned to completely different countries. The heroes of this film are Artek children of the last Soviet shift in August 1991 from various former Soviet republics.
