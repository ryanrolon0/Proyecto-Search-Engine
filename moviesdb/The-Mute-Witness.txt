The Mute Witness

 Jim Regan, photographer, was sent by his paper to make snapshots of wild game. He found old Barlow, a trapper, possessed of two pretty daughters, and promptly fell in love with Mabel, who responded. Carrie, the other daughter, loved Ralph Conway, a mountain scamp. One day, Jim, in the woods with Barlow, sets his camera so that he might get a snapshot of a bear, attaching the camera by mechanical means to the bear trap so that when it operates the camera would get the picture. That after noon Ralph Conway induced Carrie to elope with him, Barlow having refused permission for the marriage. In anger Conway sought the old man out, found him leaning over the bear trap and felled him with a blow. In an instant his own foot was caught and he went spinning into the air. Old Barlow, hours afterwards, staggered throughout the woods toward home. Meanwhile, curious about his camera, Regan went to the trap, found Conway, releases him and took his camera back. In the quickly made dark room, Regan found a negative of Conway in the act of striking old Barlow. He rushed out, caught Carrie just as she was about to leave for the rendezvous and grappled with Conway. Just then old Barlow staggered in. No explanations were needed. Barlow simply took up his gun and pointed and Conway with a laugh, turned his evil face towards the mountains.
