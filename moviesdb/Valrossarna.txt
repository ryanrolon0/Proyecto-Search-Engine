Valrossarna

 It's freezing cold in the Öresund strait in winter. Even though the thermometer not often shows anything below a couple of degrees minus, the barometer is set on a raw humidity and the wind is pushing on from the North Sea. Would you get the idea to jump into the pitch-black Öresund naked in these circumstances - without nothing that even looks like a sauna nearby?
