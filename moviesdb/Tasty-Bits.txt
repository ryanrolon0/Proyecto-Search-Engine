Tasty Bits

 Mix sexy Russian lesbians, gangsters, the KGB and old-school musical numbers and you get TASTY BITS, the first lesbian comedy from Russia - with love! Heavy drinking, buxom blonde radio personality Julia is used to getting what she wants, from fame to the most delicious women. When her radio station is threatened with imminent sale, she employs high-rolling thugs and mysterious women to wheel and deal her way out of obscurity - and into a bit of naughty fun along the way! TASTY BITS is chock-full of irreverent sex, physical comedy and one-liners as only Russians can deliver. Pass the vodka and enjoy the debauchery, post-Soviet-style.
