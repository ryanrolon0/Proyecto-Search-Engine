Roommate

 Kim, an ambitious, good-natured young woman excited to make her mark in society moves into a new apartment. The first day or two of moving keeps her busy and she barely notices minor events occurring around her. A bowl mysteriously moves and she catches small glimpses of something that she can't seem to understand. Juggling work turns the big move into an even tougher experience when she leaves the new apartment to go on a two-week business trip. What she couldn't have realized is she left a ghostly and needy presence in the process. As Kim returns, while trying to spark the flame of romance with the ever eccentric, charismatic, and dependable Tom, things turn south when the needy roommate starts to worry and starts to feel unloved. Soon, Kim finds herself stuck and trying to break free from the very apartment she couldn't wait to live in. Her only hope is that the new roommate will release her from the horrific situation that she has been forced into. That is if she has any hope left. In the end, we discover there is a lot more to this roommate then we could have possibly ever known.
