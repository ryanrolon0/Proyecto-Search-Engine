Stand Sentry

 Soldier 1 has been guarding this gate for years. Soldier 2 just showed up. They're both brandishing M16s that can tear a person in half and impeccably dressed in formal military attire - a stark contrast to the decaying world behind them. Here, on the edge of the apocalypse, they keep the "undesirables" out of the system. The film examines the battle that goes on between the two soldiers, old vs. new - a mirror for the bleak world that they now live in.
