Sounds of a New Hope

 Growing up around Los Angeles neighborhood gangs during the '90s, a young Filipino-American named Kiwi became an MC and community organizer. He uses his hip-hop to raise the consciousness of youth from San Francisco to Metro Manila. He gets them involved in organizing their communities, while advancing the movement for national liberation and genuine democracy in the Philippines. Through sharing life experiences, beats, and rhymes, they make connections across oceans that inspire the next generation to continue the ongoing struggle for freedom.
