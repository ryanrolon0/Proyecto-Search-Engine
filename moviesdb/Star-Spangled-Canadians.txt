Star Spangled Canadians

 Award-winning documentary filmmaker David Paperny, with host Jeffrey Simpson, take a close look at the controversy, myths and realities behind the Canadian exodus to the United States. This program focuses on our perception of ourselves. What does it mean to be Canadian? How do we define ourselves? We meet some famous Canadians, some quietly successful Canadians and some very ambitious Canadians. They all live in the United States, with varying opinions and reasons for their decision.
