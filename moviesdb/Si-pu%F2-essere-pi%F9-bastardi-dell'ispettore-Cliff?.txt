Si può essere più bastardi dell'ispettore Cliff?

 Undercover cop infiltrates a drug ring that is importing stuff from Lebanon, turns double agent, plays traffickers against corrupt cops, and intends to keep both the money, and the drugs. He also intends to keep the drug ring leader's woman, whom he wooed in the process. A long plan that develops well, in bloodshed and deaths galore until top cop seems to be the sole winner. The unexpected happens then.
