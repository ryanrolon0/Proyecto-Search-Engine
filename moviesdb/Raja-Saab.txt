Raja Saab

 Born and brought up in an orphanage, it has always been Rajoo's dream of becoming a wealthy man, particularly a Prince of any region. His dreams land him in trouble when he misbehaves with Rajkumari Poonam, and is expelled from the orphanage. He seeks works as a masseur and goes to work with Prince Pratap Singh, who hires him, is so happy with his work, that he would like him to impersonate him and thus fulfill his dream of becoming a Prince. The only problem is that he has to insult and humiliate Princess Poonam, the very woman with whom he had misbehaved, and has fallen head-over-heels in love with her. The question remains, will his love of becoming a Prince overcome his true love for Poonam? The song "Rajoo ka hai ek khwab, Rajoo raja raja saab, raaj hai na taaj hai, phir bhi main raaj saab" continues to be popular even today.
