Vibration for Healing

 Vibration for Healing, The Sound You Feel consists of over twenty vignettes centering on sound healers - most of whom use the crystal singing bowls- and illustrates the many uses of sound for physical, emotional and spiritual healing. From "singing" with the dolphins in Hawaii, to meeting a "peace pilgrim" in Oregon; from a space clearing at a Madison Avenue art gallery to a recital at Santa Fe's famous Loretto Chapel, this film portrays people who have visions of a new day, people who hope to heal the planet by using their voices and the healing vibrations of crystal singing bowls.
