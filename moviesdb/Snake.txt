Snake

 'Snake' is an aging gunfighter with a heart. He is still the best there is with a .44 and he is challenged by a kid trying to make a name for himself. Snake could have easily killed him, but instead shoots him in the knee and then breaks his gun hand so he cannot fast draw again, but can still work.
