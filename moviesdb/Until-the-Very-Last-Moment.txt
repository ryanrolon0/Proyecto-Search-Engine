Until the Very Last Moment

 Until The Very last Moment follows a young college student Johanna over the last 7 days before the world is supposed to end. That date November 17th, 2009 was declared by a group of individuals known as Instinctive Ones who came to believe the world will end the same way an animal can sense a natural disaster. With each passing day her and her friends, who have chosen to remain on the college campus, discuss and ruminate on issues of crisis, fear, reactionary politics and human behavior. Her hipster roommate Charlotte is terrified she hasn't lived her life to the fullest. Billy is too busy making his apocalyptic documentary to think about how he feels. Sylvia, an atheist, is annoyed at everyone's foolishness. Nicholas, a sage-like artist, has complete acceptance at whatever comes his way. Meanwhile Pat, a religious zealot and self-proclaimed prophet, preaches and marches throughout the streets with his followers preparing for the faithful day. Johanna is torn between the choices her friends and the groups around her make and is stuck in a state of indecision. Will the world end? Will it not end? Does it even matter what happens?
