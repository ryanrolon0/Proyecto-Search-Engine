Roll on Texas Moon

 To get the Delaney ranch Cole's henchman Anders has started a phony range war between the cattlemen and sheepmen. After killing Delaney, he tries to kill his daughter Jill and then Roy who was sent to investigate the war. But the failed attempts gives Roy the information he needs. Roy Rogers ('Roy Rogers (I)' (qv))comes to Merino Springs to prevent a range war between cattlemen and sheepmen, that started as a result of the killing of a sheep-man, Matthew Delaney ('John Ince (I)' (qv)) on "Whirligig Cattle Syndicate" property. He was killed by Steve Anders ('Francis McDonald (I)' (qv), a henchman of Cole Gregory ('Dennis Hoey (I)' (qv)), who is out to acquire the Delaney ranch. Roy's pleas for the murdered man's daughter, Jill Delaney ('Dale Evans (I)' (qv)) to help prevent further bloodshed are dashed when her prized ram is also killed. It does not help matters that her lawyer is the scheming Gregory.
