Sabungero

 An ordinary man blessed with the uncanny gift of breeding, raising, and fighting gamecocks. He gets caught up in the gambling part of the sport and loses everything. He has one chance left to prove to himself and his family and friends that he is a winner and not a bum. He changes his life and attempts to put everything back in order by winning the World Slasher Cup International Derby at Araneta Coliseum. Will he succeed?
