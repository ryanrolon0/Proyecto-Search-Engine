Rounds

 "Here is to friends." As Terry, Jensen and Will raise their glasses in the air and toast something many take for granted, friendship. Rounds follows these three, each on a private quest to find what friendship means to each other, where instant attractions, casual betrayals and an innocent glance can test that very thing. Hollywood's rock and roll nights and coffee house days set the backdrop as they must rely on each other to make it successfully through the maze of adulthood where their pasts, the fears and lessons they've been taught threaten to destroy it all, including their friendship. In life, we all make the rounds; will we make them matter?
