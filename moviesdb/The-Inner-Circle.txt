The Inner Circle

 The Inner Circle is a film about a woman who survives breast cancer and has gone through a mastectomy. The film's about the interplay between sexuality in the larger cultural experience and how the disease affects the woman and her inner circle # her husband and friends - both psychologically, emotionally and socially. The Inner Circle is an ensemble film exploring the fears and desires of a colorful array of characters within their intimate group of friends and lovers during a dinner party held at Jack and Barbara's house. In dealing with our cultural obsession with the physicality of sexuality, Leo, the occassional astrologer, sees that sometimes it takes larger forces for his friends to recognize what really drives them. We see that it's the unexpected, including Barbara's recent bout with breast cancer, that brings out a hidden side of even those closest to us. This story takes us through the funny, touching, aggreavating, absurd,compassionate, and sometimes unrestrained events of a single day when friends unite under tense circumstances. Several characters set out comfortably cloaked in their own issues of denial which begin to crack once confronted with their fears. The shock of the film's reveal stays with you long after the end.
