Same Deep Sky as You

 The film collects and presents memories in a timeless flux. The nostalgic quality of super-8 film - in which the entire film was shot - along with the moving track 'Summertime' by Moby, frees the audience from time and place, allowing them to be reflective in way that reflects the mind's own rhythm.
