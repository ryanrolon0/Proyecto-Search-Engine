The Telemarketers

 There's Woonaki, the boss, a self-imagined little shogun, who hangs suspended between two wives- one living, one dead- literally. There's Roman, a cross-dressing, four hundred pound, flatulent, arrogant gothic. Blunt smoking, video junkie J.J., and his wanna-be crew psychic, Eric the actor, Marty the writer (who's got to get "paid"), Mrs. A, the housewife, who wants to get laid. Plus touretters, cons, comedians, and a singer... All adding their "flava" to this unexpected feature that chronicles 36 hours in the lives of the colorful misfits who make up a Hollywood telemarketing office.
