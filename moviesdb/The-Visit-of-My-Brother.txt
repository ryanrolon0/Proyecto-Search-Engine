The Visit of My Brother

 The portrait of Jungmin is alike the lives of us; making choices and regretting it again and again. Through this movie, I tried to cast a question about the choices made among many relationships being favorably directed. Also, this movie will indirectly talk about sacrifices that we had to make by compromising with others.
