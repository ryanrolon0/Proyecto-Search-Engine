Unfailing

 A secret criminal organization, headed by Mr. Takamura, arranges a tournament in order to find the perfect killer. Ten young people who have nothing to lose, accept the rules and run in this revenge. To spice up the game, Silex, the right arm of Takamura, winner of the last 5 years, was introduced anonymously in the group. Between emerging friendships, rivalries and spirit of chivalry, the participants manage the tests. The eliminations are increasing and the losses are heavy. The tournament goes far to the point of no return.
