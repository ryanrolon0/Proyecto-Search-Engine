Ta mej i dalen

 Three major American stars enhance this Swedish sex film. It also offers a realistic and nostalgic look at life on a working farm. Eric Edwards plays Cousin George, a rather oafish dolt, more shy than stupid, needing assistance in learning about sex. Charles Canyon conducts the crash course that consists primarily of voyeuristic observation. Darby Llyd Rain plays a woman on the farm.
