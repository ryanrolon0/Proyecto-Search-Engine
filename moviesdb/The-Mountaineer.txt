The Mountaineer

 There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was either produced or distributed by Lubin at this time. It's not the same as The Mountaineer (1914), which is a Nestor production. Most likely the film was either announced but never made, begun and never completed, or completed and eventually released under another title, unidentifiable at this time.
