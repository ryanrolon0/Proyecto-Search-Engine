 Soon after the democratic CHANGE, the 'animals' from the newspaper 'zoo' found themselves in the 'jungle' of market relations. The bars of their 'cages' had collapsed quicker than the Berlin Wall. The inhabitants of the 'zoo' suddenly found themselves face to face with each other, 'tang' against 'tang', 'claws' against 'claws'. Some of them were fatter but clumsier. Others, lean and hungry, proved more agile. There was no more centralized supply of materials. The food sent from some more fertile 'jungles', were soon consumed, and nobody wanted to die. The 'zoo management' and the 'keepers' deftly slipped into the 'cages', locked themselves up and started inventing laws for the 'jungle'. The 'animals' took to surviving any way they could. A car was blown up... And then it looked like war...
