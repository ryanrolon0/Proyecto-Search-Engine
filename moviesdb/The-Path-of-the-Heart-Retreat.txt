The Path of the Heart Retreat

 In Tony Samara's work, the physical body is seen as the temple, and this temple should glow with light, yet we often forget about our body until we get sick. Therefore, cleansing retreats form an intrinsic part of this spiritual path. Tony Samara's cleansing retreats offer morning and afternoon discourses interspersed with energy exercises, dream work, visualizations, meditation practices, breathing and group exercises drawn from his wealth of experience with ancient shamanic, oriental and zen Buddhist traditions. They are very powerful detoxification programs due to the inclusion of herbal detox preparations, liquid super-foods and other special herbal preparations. Step inside one of Tony's retreats held in Portugal's pristine hinterland in October 2008 and discover for yourself the magic of inner and outer transformation.
