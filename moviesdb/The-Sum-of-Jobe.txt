The Sum of Jobe

 On the surface "The Sum of Jobe" is a simple love story. A homeless man falls in love with convenience store worker and follows them as they begin an unconventional relationship. But that is just what is on the surface. Underneath "Jobe" is about two people seeking redemption and dealing the demons that have haunted them for years. It is also a study of what really is normal and how that is perceived in the world.
