Warhammer 40,000

 Choose one of seven races from the DoW universe and wage war to take over the planet Kronus. Play as the Highly advanced Tau, The deadly and creepy Necrons, The Bloodthirsty Orks, the Mysterious Eldar, the insane Chaos Marines, the Brave Imperial Guard or the Fanatical and Xenophobic Space Marines. With an entirely new campaign, more like the tabletop game than a RTS.
