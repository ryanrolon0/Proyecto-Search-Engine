Song of the Lodz Ghetto

 The haunting musical program of songs from the Lodz Ghetto, as performed by Brave Old World, is the framework on which producer/director David Kaufman has created the definitive new documentary about the Lodz Ghetto. Made up equally of chilling narrative, evocative music, and unforgettable photographs, this is the first major film to feature extensive interviews with survivors of the Holocaust from Lodz.
