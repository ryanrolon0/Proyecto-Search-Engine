The Newest Pledge

 The morning after kicking off their semester with a patriotic "stars, stripes, and strippers" party, the Omegas wake up to a find a baby on their doorstep. After little deliberation, the Omegas decide to pledge the baby, giving it the pledge name "Kegston." Rico, the nerdy leader of the Phi Tau Tau fraternity, tries to use the Omegas parenthood experiment to turn the school against the fraternity; forcing the Omegas, especially their leaders Pledge and Hodges, to not only protect the Omegas reputation, but to also grow up as mature adults and parents.
