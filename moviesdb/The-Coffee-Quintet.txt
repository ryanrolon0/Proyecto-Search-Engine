The Coffee Quintet

 A modern musical tale of mistaken identity where an all-knowing barista helps a man who thinks he's meeting a blind date and a woman who thinks she's on a job interview. Add in the real interviewer and date, and you've got caffeinated confusion until everyone ends up with something they didn't expect!
