This Stuff'll Kill Ya!

 A backwoods Bible-quoting Foghorn Leghorn-ish con man who believes in free love and moon-shining runs into trouble with the locals when a series of gruesome religious murders are committed a woman is stoned and two others are crucified. Roscoe Boone is a backwater, Bible-quoting, con artist/preacher who runs a moonshine distillery in a rural Deep South town and whom controls his illegal business with a posse of redneck thugs who manufacture and traffic his moonshine whiskey and participate in his drinking sermons. But while Boone's business has support from half of the townspeople, the other half are against him especially when his preaching of drinking, free love and open marriage had led to the recent gang-rape of a young bride on her wedding day. Things get more complicated with the arrival of two Federal agents from the state capital whom threaten to shut down Boone's whiskey still for a variety of felony charges. But in another turn of events, one of Boone's most loyal followers goes on a killing spree after apparently taking Preacher Boone's bible quotes a bit too far, starting with the stoning of the young bride, and then the crucification of two other young women.
