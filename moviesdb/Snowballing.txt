Snowballing

 Bus loads of teenagers arrive to the ski resort. Each one is eager to get out on the slopes to ski and score. One problem; the owner has all the prices jacked up, secretly ripping people for the passed two years he has been in charge. The police don't do anything because the Sheriff is in on the cover-up. The teens feel their only chance to even the score is at a skiing tournament where the winner is picked to get a free trip to Hawaii. The horny teens get a terrific idea.
