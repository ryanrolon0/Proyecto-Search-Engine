Tigri di carta

 An educational project featuring real students without any acting experience. 'Tigri di carta' is a depiction of the effects of bullying and is set in a Sicilian secondary school. A young boy and a young girl discover how easy it is to be marginalized for civil behavior or for standing up for someone, when faced by bullies.
