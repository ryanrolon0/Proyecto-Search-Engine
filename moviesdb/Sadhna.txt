Sadhna

 Bipin and Karan sell women's clothing off of a sidewalk in Bombay. Bipin has always been lucky in money matters, as he even 'finds' a suitcase containing Rs.10 Lakhs, and has several affairs with women, getting them pregnant, and eventually coercing them to abort the fetus. Then one day he meets with Sadhna, the daughter of the deceased owner of the suitcase, she falls in love with him, gets pregnant, but refuses to abort her child. Bipin's friend, who has just lost his sweetheart, Madhu, comes to her rescue, marries her and agrees to look after her son as his own, even foregoing any sexual relations with her. Bipin goes on to marry Laxmi, the daughter of wealthy businessman Dhaniram, but ends up not having any children, which leads him to concoct a plot so devious that will eventually force Karan and Sadhna to surrender his biological son to him as Bipin has always manipulated fate in his favor.
