Puberty

 Days away from his Bar Mitzvah, ErnieGoldberg is trying to "become a man" with some help from his friends, his family, and a friendly phone sex operator. His father, Herman, is coming to grips with a cheating wife and a cranky dad. Will Ernie get laid? Will Herman? Only the Torah knows the answers. And it will take He-Man and a deaf Tupperware heiress to save the day.
