The Schartz-Metterklume Method

 The Schartz-Metterklume Method tells the tale of Claretta, a mysterious do-gooder, who is mistaken by the wealthy Atwater family for their newly hired nanny. Claretta shakes the family dynamic up, putting the overbearing Mrs. Atwater in her place, giving the cowardly Mr. Atwater a bit of courage, and allowing their adoring children to re-enact the greatest moments of history using the Schartz-Metterklume Method.
