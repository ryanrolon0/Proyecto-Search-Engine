Revenge of the Virgins

 Tenderfoot Burton and his wife join forces with an old prospector to search for the rich gold strike the old-timer claims to know of. Along with a couple of no-account gunslingers, they ride deep into the mountains to find the gold, unaware that the treasure is guarded by an all-female tribe of deadly, beautiful, and topless Indians.
