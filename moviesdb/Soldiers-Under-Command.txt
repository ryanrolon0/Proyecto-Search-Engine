Soldiers Under Command

 Stryper was the first Christian rock band to successfully cross over into the mainstream music scene, selling 9 million records during the course of their career. The band broke up in 1993. Ten years later, they agreed to play a one-time show at a Christian rock expo outside Los Angeles, California. Will the band get back together? Does God want the band to reunite?
