Shoots & Ladders

 No cow patty is too large an obstacle for Rex Wagner, the Jewish Cowboy, who recently moved to New York to become a movie star. He exudes a naive self confidence that actually enables him to literally fall into success, willing his way even in the most unlikely circumstances. Jason O'Malley, the jaded and cynical thespian from Massachusetts, however, doesn't need an Irish wake for an excuse to drink. The misfortunes that befall him are both comical and tragic, as he drowns his sorrows in pints of the darkest draft of all beers. Rex and Jason seem to follow a predetermined course set by the "stars." Their characters provide a unique and hilarious inside look at the world of the movie extra in particular and the movie industry as a whole.
