Wagner

 Elena's job is working on the percussion press 'Wagner' of 1933. This is a tragic comedy about the absurdity of one day in life, in which her dream comes true. She gets an apartment on an installment plan. In the inclement day of November, she goes to have a look at her future property. Her happiness brought a soporific languor to her and she soon falls asleep in the empty flat. She wakes up late in the night feeling very hungry. So her trip up and down the floors of the block begins in search of a piece of bread.
