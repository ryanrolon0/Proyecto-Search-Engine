The Battle of the Bozos

 Two New York City companies. Twenty-five Bozo the Clown bop bags. A window-display face-off that culminated in a shock-and-awe campaign of pure clown force on an otherwise ordinary Monday morning. 'The Battle of the Bozos' chronicles the true story of how a harmless gag gift from a holiday party inadvertently touched off a showdown between strangers -- and proves that, in a big place like New York, you never know who's watching.
