Sorry Safari

 Tom and Jerry have stowed away in the luggage of a big game hunter who lands in Nairobi (Tom is sort of the hunter's assistant). They ride along on his Nertz U-Drive elephant. Tom has some problems with a gun. Jerry then unbuckles the passenger box from the elephant; Tom gets blamed. A lion attacks; Jerry gets Tom to hand the hunter a thermos instead of a rifle. Tom stashes Jerry in the elephant's trunk, which frightens him. Bad timing, as there's a charging rhino. Fortunately, they land atop the rhino; Jerry and the elephant carry off the rhino, the hunter, and Tom, tied up and hanging from a log.
