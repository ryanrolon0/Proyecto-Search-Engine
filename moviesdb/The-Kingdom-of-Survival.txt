The Kingdom of Survival

 An interdisciplinary documentary combining speculative travelogue and investigative journalism in order to trace possible links between survivalism, spirituality, art, radical politics, outlaw culture, alternative media and fringe philosophy. The film investigates physical and psychological survival strategies practiced by groups and individuals in the modern world. Maverick writer and filmmaker M.A. Littler hits the outlaw highway in search of visions that challenge the status quo. On his journey Littler crosses paths with renowned linguist and dissident Prof. Noam Chomsky, outlaw historian Dr. Mark Mirabello, gonzo journalist Joe Bageant, legendary reclusive cabin builder Mike Oehler, anarchist book publisher Ramsey Kanaan, egalitarian radio host Sasha Lilley and folk musician Will 'The Bull' Taylor. Together they explore radical and alternative visions for the 21st century.
