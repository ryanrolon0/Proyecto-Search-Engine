Riding Wild

 It's roundup time and Stevens is out to start a range war between the big ranchers and the nesters. Tim Malloy is elected to head the roundup but is unable to stop the war and joins the nesters. With the nesters now well organized, Stevens finds a Malloy look-alike and makes a plan to use him to trap the nesters and wipe them out.
