 Harper, a young blonde American girl modeling in Japan, has become involved with Hashimoto, a notorious Japanese gangster. She has an affair with the sexy philandering Carlo (one of Hashimoto's hit men) that ends in Carlo's murder. Harper then flees back to America and writes a tell-all book about the Yakuza. Hashimoto soon finds out and comes to America to seek revenge.
