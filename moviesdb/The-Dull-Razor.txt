The Dull Razor

 You shave yourself? You do? Then you know what a dull razor can do in the hands of an awkward man. This picture is considered one of the masterpieces in laughable subjects, extremely funny for everybody but the poor fellow shaving himself. The facial contortions of this man are so funny that the lens of the taking camera itself shared the jolity and turned out a great, happy, wonderful picture. The length of this picture is 75 feet; therefore, it is a full continual laugh 75 feet long.
