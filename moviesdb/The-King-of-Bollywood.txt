The King of Bollywood

 London-based Crystal Chaurasia convinces the International Film Commission to authorize a documentary on Bollywood's yesteryear mega-actor, Karan Kumar. She travels with her photographer, Jeremy, to Mumbai and not only gets to meet the legendary actor but also his publicity-shy son, Rahul; and alcoholic and reclusive former-actress wife, Mandira. It is here Crystal will be drawn into continuing her documentary in London where she will witness the making of Karan's next movie 'Dhak Dhak' in which he decides to not only produce and direct but also hilariously play the role of a college student.
