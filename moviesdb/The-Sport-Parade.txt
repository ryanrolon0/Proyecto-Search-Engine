The Sport Parade

 Dartmouth football stars Sandy Brown and Johnny Baker follow different paths after college the money of the pro game, but ends up as a wrestler with big debts. Irene Stewart is the woman that comes between them, and a bored radio announcer adds the few light moments as he follows their careers. Two former college athletes and pals, majoring in football, baseball and track, graduate and go out into the world and learn that yesterday's hero in college is today's forgotten man in the world of hard knocks. One becomes a sports writer while the other attempts to capitalize on his medals by endorsements and vaudeville appearances. They are reunited as newspaper writers where they both compete for the interest of a pretty newspaper cartoonist, and one takes up professional wrestling...and finds it is a very crooked game. The only gay-interest in this one is in the eyes of a wishful beholder who added it as a keyword.
