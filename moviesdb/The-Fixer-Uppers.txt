The Fixer Uppers

 Door-to-door greeting card salesmen Stanley and Oliver call upon Mrs. Pierre Gustave, a woman distraught over her husband's neglect. They agree to her plan to reclaim her husband's affection by making him jealous. But when Gustave arrives and finds his wife and Oliver in a tight embrace, he presents Oliver with his card and challenges him to a duel. The boys escape, but get drunk and pass out at a local cafe, and are returned to Gustave's apartment when the police find Gustave's card in Oliver's pocket. They awake (in Mrs. Gustave's bed) to find the enraged husband, pistol in hand.
