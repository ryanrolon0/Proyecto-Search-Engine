Tunten lügen nicht

 Bosom buddies BeV StroganoV, Ovo Maltine, Ichgola Androgyn and Tima die Göttliche are four Berlin drag queens who met in the mid 1980s. These four queens became Germany's most popular drag performers and have been busy fertilizing the German cultural scene. Besides being performers, they are also political activists - in AIDS awareness, anti-gay violence, the sex workers movement and the struggle against the extreme right and racism. The film tells their story.
