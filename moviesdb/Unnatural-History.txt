Unnatural History

 Are animals human? Or vice versa? This is the question asked by a professor, Dr. Beest Lee, who appears on a stage in a theater to give a lecture and show a film about the human-like qualities of various cartoon animals, among them a beaver who "damns" a troublesome river, a groundhog who uses technology to predict the coming of spring, and a dog who scolds his neglectful master.
