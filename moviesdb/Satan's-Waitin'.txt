Satan's Waitin'

 Sylvester's carnivorious pursuit of Tweety Bird continues, chasing the canary onto the ledge of a tall building. He plummets to the sidewalk below, losing one of his nine "lives"; the spirit descends into Hell, where the puddy tat meets up with a Satanic bulldog. There, the bulldog encourages Sylvester to risk his remaining eight "lives" chasing the bird in the most dangerous of situations. Sylvester loses his second "life" when crushed beneath a steamroller; his third frightened after realizing he chased Tweety into a carnival tunnel (that had a lion's mouth opening); "lives" four through seven while on a shooting gallery; and his eighth just after grabbing the bird on a speeding roller coaster car. The Satanic bulldog reappears and demands Sylvester "go get him"; the puddy tat resists temptation and takes refuge in a seemingly safe bank vault. Sylvester soon regrets his move. Sylvester Cat risks all nine of his lives in his reckless pursuit of Tweety Bird. Each time he "dies", one of his nine spirits goes to Hades.
