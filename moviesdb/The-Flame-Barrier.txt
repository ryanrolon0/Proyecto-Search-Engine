The Flame Barrier

 Carol Dahlmann enlists the Hollister brothers to help locate her missing husband. The husband was tracking a fallen satellite through the jungle. While tracking him down, the trio discover an unusually strong acid killing animals and people. Carol Dahlman (Kathleen Crowley) persuades Dave Hollister (Arthur Franz), against his will, to help her search for her husband who disappeared in the Yucatan jungle while he was searching for a lost sattelite. Dave, his brother Matt (Robert Brown), and Carol, after many a harrowing experience, locate the missing satellite and the corpse of her husband (Dan Gachman). Much to their horror, the satellite exudes a mysterious substance which disintegrates anything that gets too near it.
