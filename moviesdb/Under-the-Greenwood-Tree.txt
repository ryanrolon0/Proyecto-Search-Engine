Under the Greenwood Tree

 Young educated beauty Fancy Day comes to town to teach school and care for ailing father. Soon gossip around town turns to who Miss Day will marry. The lead contender is wealthy Mr. Shiner. Fancy however has also caught the attention of poor Dick Dewy and the Parson Maybold. Poor Fancy is also caught in the middle of a feud between the Parson and the former church choir when the Parson introduces a harmonium to provide the church music effectively usurping the choir and asks Fancy to play.
