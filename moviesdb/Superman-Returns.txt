Superman Returns

 Loosely modeled off of the feature film Superman Returns, the game ventures into a more intricate story. After stopping a meteor shower from destroying Metropolis, Superman ventures to the planet Krypton only to find it destroyed and undiscovered. Upon his return home he is stopped by the Warlord where he faces off against Mongul. Victory goes to Superman and upon returning home, he finds that it is overrun with robots and their leader Metallo. To make matters worse, Lex Luthor has broke into the Fortress of Solitutde and now has an evil plan to create his own continent of land with a kryptonite crust. Using the man of steel as well as his many talents and techniques, saving Metropolis is just one step in Superman Returns to saving the entire world.
