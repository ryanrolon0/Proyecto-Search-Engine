Thunderbird 6

 The International Rescue team is faced with one of its toughest challenges yet, as the revolutionary lighter-than-air craft Skyship One is hijacked while on her maiden voyage around the world. Against backdrops including the Statue of Liberty and the Sphinx, Lady Penelope, Parker, Alan and Tin-Tin fight the hijackers from on-board, while the rest of the team tries to stop the airship crashing into a missile silo. Jeff Tracy is driving Brains up the wall by demanding he design a spectacular new rescue vehicle, a Thunderbird 6, and then constantly rejecting all his efforts. Still, at least Brains got further with an airline company when he designed a revolutionary airship for them. Lady Penelope and some of the International Rescue crew are the honoured guests on the maiden round-the-world flight but sinister forces are at work and a plan is put into action that may leave Jeff with only his brand-new Thunderbird 6. If he evers accepts one of Brain's designs, that is.
