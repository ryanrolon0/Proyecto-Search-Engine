Sudesi

 An idealist named Hindustani comes across evidence against the State's Chief Minister R.C. Narayan. He abducts his aide, a politician named Raghavchari, then fakes his death by a motor vehicle accident. After convincing everyone about this death, he keeps him captive, and starts to blackmail the Chief Minister with hopes to bring about change - but Narayan has other plans for him.
