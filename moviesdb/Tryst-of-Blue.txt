Tryst of Blue

 Guy Mann has been cursed since birth with Blue skin. He still lives in his New York City orphanage well after the usual age of release. With a single clue to their whereabouts and nothing to lose, he leaves to find 'his people'. The quest takes him to the mountains of North Carolina, the beaches of the Dominican Republic, the islands off of Ireland, the gardens of Japan and the holy land of India. Being Blue is not his only predicament; he also lacks the ability to outwardly express his emotions. Although he has feelings on the inside, he is only able to mimic the emotions around him. Feelings he interprets with his five senses reflect the emotions of others, not his own. Guy hopes that when he finds his Blue family, they will have a cure or at least help him to cope with his dysfunction. Told in five parts to represent each of the five senses, the sheltered 25-year-old learns to understand his own senses and those around him. To define 'Family', Guy must seek beyond what he can see, touch, taste, smell or hear.
