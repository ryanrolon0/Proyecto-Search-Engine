Sterne über dem Eis

 Marine biology college professor Martin Schell and his partner prepare an Arctic expedition to the coast of Spitzbergen. But his sister, forgotten for years, suddenly comes dumps on him their semi-dependent dad, so she can have a holiday. Old Kurt Schell refuses to be left in a seniors home, escapes and gets a friend to arrange for him a 'press' spot on the expedition ship. Being discovered only after it sailed, he must bunk with Martin. Real reporter Nina, who failed to get out of this assignment, has a past with Martin, which Kurt won't let them ignore.
