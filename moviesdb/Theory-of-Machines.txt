Theory of Machines

 Structured as a two minute long shot and based on "Theory of Machines" by contemporary composer Ben Frost, this short film gradually unfolds in front of the spectator to progressively show the mysterious aura of the surroundings, the sensuous motion of the feminine body and the abrupt effect of modern life.
