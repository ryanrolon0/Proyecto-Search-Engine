The Hustler's Last Score

 There comes a time in every hustler's life when they reach a cross road. Either they take it upon themselves to bow out the game, still remain in it because that's all they know, go to jail, or end up dead. With jealousy and envy comes betrayal. And the worst betrayal to come by is one from a friend. But every hustle must come to an end, and for Riq this just might be the 'Hustler's Last Score'
