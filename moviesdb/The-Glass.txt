The Glass

 It's Chile, 1974. Tim, the adventurous son of a missionary, is caught in the middle of the war between the Chilean Freedom fighters and the Pinochet Military. When Tim's parents are kidnapped, he heads into the forest to rescue them with the help of his new find -- an ancient piece of glass that, when he looks through it, shows him the future. Tim must find a way to save his family and restore hope to the small village of Morado.
