Risiko Null - Der Tod steht auf dem Speiseplan

 Journalist Moritz Nestler is working on an article about the neat madness and the way it's danger is played down by the politicians. A bullock's head, which is infected with the disease, is played into his hands and makes him realize that Germany is now affected by BSE too. In unofficial interviews with scientists he learns that BSE possibly could infect humans too - but before he can publish anything, he's found dead. His girlfriend and colleague Ute Boehning doesn't believe in an accident and wants to continue his investigation - although her father, who owns a slaughter-house, asks her not to.
