USA the Movie

 USA THE MOVIE is an independent landmark, a fictional drive through reality, a prophetic journey into the future of humanity. One of the main elements is Kirk, a comfortable "All American" traveler who awakens from blissful ignorance into painful awareness of the world. He grows increasingly confused and destructive, fulfilling his destiny as the instrument of ultimate extinction. Real scenes of his physical and emotional breakdown, which were captured during filming, act as a thread between fiction and reality. USA THE MOVIE is a journey inside the essence of a Superpower; a country that shocks the world with its might, bringing out envy, anger and hatred in the hearts of other nations. The film deliberately utilizes the feel of sweeping epic, independent drama, historic newsreel and gritty verite' to tell the story. Evocative visuals, masterful sound, and poetry create a sublime sense of simplicity. Unique and diverse speeches that catalyzed the destruction of nations, provoked the assassination of their speakers, expressed the deep sorrow of leaders, and manipulated the emotions of the people, are woven within the story. This is not only a handcrafted work, but a voice to be heard that could only rise through the spirit.
