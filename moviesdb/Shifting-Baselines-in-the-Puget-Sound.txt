Shifting Baselines in the Puget Sound

 The Puget Sound is slowly shifting into degredation. Did you know scientists can now detect the presence of mint and cinnamon in the Puget Sound, at increased levels around the holidays? Where did you think it all goes? But mint and cinnamon are only the beginning. The symbol of the Puget Sound, the orca, is popping up dead all over the Seattle region. Their bodies are so filled with toxins and chemicals that they can only be buried at a Level 3 hazardous waste disposal site. Worst of all we are becoming desensitized to a world that doesn't have orcas, where we can't swim in the water or eat the fish because of mercury levels. Our baseline for understanding the Puget Sound has been shifted.
