Una aventura en la noche

 Fernandito, a scriptwriter finds his best friend, Arturo Centella a film director, dead in his apartment. A police detective, finds a posthumous letter written by Arturo and ask to Fernandito that tells the story behind it. Then, Fernandito begins to tell what seems to be a story of supernatural events. One night, after leaving an spiritualism session with Dr. William Castle, Fernandito and Arturo find two beautiful and mysterious girls, Elena and Amparo, in the road and offer to ride them home. Arturo falls in love with Elena, despite she doesn't seem to much interested on him. However, they arranged a date for tomorrow night, but when the guys arrive they're informed by a neighbor that the girls died two months ago. Arturo and Fernandito, not quite impressed by the creepy news, don't believe this and start an investigation about what happened with the girls, in a case in which maybe is involved Dr. Castle and a family dedicated to supernatural research.
