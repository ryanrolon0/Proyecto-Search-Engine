The Ranchman's Marathon

 Charley Wacher and Bob Culver were both madly enraptured with pretty Polly Daniels. They did not take young John Beverly into consideration, but Polly certainly did. When approached on the subject, Polly complained that both Wacher and Culver were much too old. This so wrought up Culver and Wacher that they decided to do a marathon. The one who could run the longest was to receive the hand of the gracious Miss Polly. Meantime, young John Beverly seized the elusive Polly and rushed her away to the minister. On their return, they met the two marathon runners, and informed them of the marriage."
