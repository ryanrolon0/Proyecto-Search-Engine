The Girl in the Limousine

 Tony and Freddie, who've been rivals all their lives, vie for the hand in marriage of their childhood sweetheart. Big Freddie seems to have the upper hand when Tony gets himself kidnapped by a ring of muggers whose M.O. is to have one of their members dress up as a woman in order to lure men into the back seat of their limousine, where they're beaten up and robbed.
