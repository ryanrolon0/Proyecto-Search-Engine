 Stephanie is a beautiful sexy woman and she knows it. One ordinary day, she catches the eye of a strange man who can see through her beauty to the self-absorbed ugliness inside. After suffering a personal affront, the being, who seems to be nothing more than a creepy accordion playing hobo, decides to teach her a lesson. After taunting her with grizzly reflections of a malicious version of herself, he compels her to destroy her face and face her fears.
