The Schumann Story

 Short film adaptation of 'Song of Love (1947)' (qv), sketching the artistic triumphs and emotional upheavals in the lives of composer Robert Schumann, his wife Clara Wieck Schumann, and their friend, composer Johannes Brahms. Robert Schumann suffers more than most artists for his art, in that he is a victim of clinical depression, in an age when it could neither be diagnosed nor treated. His wife and friend struggle to support him and his work.
