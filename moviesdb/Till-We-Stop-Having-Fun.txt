Till We Stop Having Fun

 Willa Renee Brackett couldn't make a decision if her life depended on it; from the right outfit to the right job or even the right boyfriend. But when her perfect on paper boyfriend Jordan sets up the perfect morning of pampering, she feels like finally everything is...perfect. That is, until her best friend Caroline Pohl gets overly excited at Willa finally finding "the one" sending Willa into a whirlwind of panic and fear. Til We Stop Having Fun is an indecisive romantic comedy about life with, but preferably without, commitment.
