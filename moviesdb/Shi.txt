Shi

 Haunted by a painful event in the past, developer, Trevor Harris finds himself searching for a vehicle to bring him peace. At first glance, one would think he has his addictions, and successful life in check. His lifestyle, and lovely caring wife are evidence of this. But something brews behind Trevor's eyes, corrosively attacking his psyche after a chance encounter with a seductive Asian lady named, Shi. Tantalized by her beauty and freedom she brings behind closed doors, Trevor loses control of his life, as his demons return. 'But did Trevor ever really have his life under control?' we ask, after learning, in the balance between what is beyond our understanding, and what is earthly.... Trevor's life was never what it seemed to have been.
