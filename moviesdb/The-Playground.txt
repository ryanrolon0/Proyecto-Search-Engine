The Playground

 While walking home from school one day, 16 year old Joseph Lopez found himself in the midst of a firefight on the playground of the St. Nicholas Houses Public Housing Project. Lopez lives in the St. Nicholas Houses with his mother Alejandrina. She was inside their apartment when she heard the shots ring out. Another St. Nicholas resident, Darlene Goode, was enjoying the late September day on one of the playgrounds benches as the shooting began. The Playground tells the story of three neighbors experience of violence, fear, love, and courage in the face of gun violence.
