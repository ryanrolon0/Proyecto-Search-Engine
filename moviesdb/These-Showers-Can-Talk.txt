These Showers Can Talk

 A comedic film about lesbian liaisons, stereotypes, and dating. Samantha and Gloria are having breakfast at a local cafe, and begin to argue over their relationship. Samantha leaves the cafe to vent to her friend Maggie; a stereotypical "lipstick" lesbian. Maggie is busy getting ready for work, while Samantha is trying to ask her for solutions to her problem. Samantha becomes frustrated by not getting a clear answer from Maggie and heads to Genevieve's apartment. Genevieve is an ultra free spirited bisexual who is in the shower as Samantha dishes out once again her relationship problem, where she discovers more surprises about Genevieve. Samantha calls her butch friend, Lisa who invites her to watch a football game, and is unable to get an answer from Lisa, too. Samantha now seeks advice from her straight friend Daisy, only to hear she has her own news for Samantha. Since Daisy was no help, Samantha visits her "Mystery Voice" friend where she finally gets her answers.
