Some Art Thing

 Nancy Hartigan, the owner of a trendy art gallery, masks the pain of her failing marriage as she hosts the opening of her latest exhibit, for her longtime female friend. Despite her marital neglect, Nancy has a successful career and has overcome her 'housewife days.' While the patrons view the art, what is really on display are the various emotions and complications of everyday relationships. Stages of relationships are revealed from 'love at first sight,' the comfortable and comedic companionship of a longtime lover, the support of siblings when realizing the death of a parent, the desperation of needing to be loved and recognized, and, of course, the pain felt when your spouse has found love elsewhere.
