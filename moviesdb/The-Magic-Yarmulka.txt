The Magic Yarmulka

 Momo, one-third Muslim, falls in love with Rebecca Shvitz (Jewish American) based on a picture he encounters. Momo's best pal, David Benssoussan, also Jewish but with French origins, gives him a box that holds a magic yarmulka, stolen from his father's house. "The Natives say whoever wears the magic yarmulka gets any girl he desires." Momo struggles to beat the odds of being none Jewish, and therefore decides to change himself to anything Rebecca desires even if it means converting. David's father Pierre Benssoussan, on the other hand, is not thrilled with the pilfering of the magic yarmulka and is hell bent on getting it back because if he doesn't, his dead mother Nicolette Benssoussan will rise from her slumber six feet below. Rebecca's Grandma Shvitz has her own agenda about what she is going to do as soon as the yarmulka is returned. The magic yarmulka brings together six amazing different human beings all in the pursuit of love, money, and to remain dead. Maybe it really is magical.
