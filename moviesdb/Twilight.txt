 Is Physics coming to an end? Documentary filmmaker Jeffrey Gold explores how the natural limitations of experimentation is preventing theory from being tested at the levels to which we've grown accustomed. When the ever-more elaborate theories have no chance of ever being tested, when the laboratory for such an experiment itself would require the size or energies of galaxies, which presents obvious budgetary limitations, then the connection betwee the mind and the world, as physicist Richard Price puts it, is coming to an end.
