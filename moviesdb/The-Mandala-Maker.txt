The Mandala Maker

 The story of Naomi, a struggling artist, who dares to dream of a better life. But, is there a better life in sight? Naomi, whose art career and life is seemingly headed nowhere, also has a terrible tragedy from her past that is holding her back from advancing her soul ... and life. This dark secret has overwhelmed her, and taken control of her existence. It has come between her relationship with her boyfriend, Eric, and has held her back in both social and career situations. One day, Naomi discovers the secret of Tibetan Mandalas - circular designs that psychologists - even the legendary Carl Jung, an influential thinker and the founder of analytical psychology - will tell you have 'healing' powers in them. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for Naomi. Once discovered, Naomi attempts to heal herself from this hidden tragedy by painting these very designs. While she does this, Naomi summons the courage to face her past, and walks a spiritual journey toward enlightenment. A journey she begins to embrace rather than fight, as she has in her past.
