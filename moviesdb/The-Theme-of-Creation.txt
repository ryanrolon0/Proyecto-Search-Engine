The Theme of Creation

 Adapted from Meher Baba's 1955 book, 'God Speaks,' The Theme of Creation explores the origin of the universe, evolution, and the purpose of all life. Blending footage shot in India and America, the film traces the journey of the soul from its unconscious origin through to God-Realization.
