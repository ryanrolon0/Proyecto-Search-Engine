The Audience Strikes Back

 "The Audience Strikes Back" is the story of eight very different people who are brought together for what is supposed to be a friendly discussion about Star Wars, but who during one short evening unleash their opinions on everything from Christian fundamentalism to gay marriage to the war in Iraq as well. The film culminates in an unexpected outburst of violence.
