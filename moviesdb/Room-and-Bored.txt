Room and Bored

 Fox has a furnished apartment which he desires to rent to a nice, quiet, respectable citizen like himself, and he especially wants no riff-raff tenant. What he wants and what he gets are two different things as along comes Crow with his own furnishings and decides to move in. Crow proceeds to make himself at home by tossing out Fox's fine furniture and fixings' and brings in his own junk, including a player piano, a juke box and a set of drums, all of which the jitter-bugging Crow plays all night. The Fox tries to evict him the next morning, but the crow simulates a raging snowstorm outside his window and the soft-hearted landlord allows him to stay. And then, although it is mid-July and hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, Fox hustles down to the basement and starts shoveling coal into the furnace.
