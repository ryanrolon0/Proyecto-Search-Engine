Rotweinrock und Lammfellmantel

 A documentary about Waltraud Koehler - a local institution - and her laundry. For twenty years, day after day, she has run her business in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg. Every minute simply shows her devotion for her shop and her customers. But at the age of almost 70 it is time to go.
