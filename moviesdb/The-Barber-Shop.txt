The Barber Shop

 Barber O'Hair has a vegetarian wife at home a pretty manicurist at work. A dog sits in the barbershop which O'Hair explains man and cut his ear off. And the dog got it. Been back here ever since." Oh, and he captures a bank robber. Cornelius O'Hair's small town barber shop helps him get away from his nagging harridan of a wife while providing him with a captive audience for his inflated tall stories about past exploits and neighborhood gossip. His ineptitude causes him to disfigure one customer with a razor and scald another while inadvertently locking a third in his steam room. He gets a chance to impress his pretty manicurist when a fleeing bank bandit comes to the shop looking for a sartorial makeover.
