Qak'aslemal

 Qak'aslemal (our existence) presents the diverse worlds that form the multicultural and multiethnic complex Guatemala. Through the personal view of its director, we see a knitting of images of Guatemalan people, the surroundings, jobs and traditions in four musical movements Cultures, Religion and Death. The arid view of the sandstone pillars of Momostenango, the hands of the women weavers of San Juan la Laguna, the huge kites of Sumpango and the ruins of the Mayan civilization are some of the images registered to make an analogy with the cycle of life, in a perfect balance of beauty and reality.
