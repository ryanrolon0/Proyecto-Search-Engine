Roommates

 An empty room in the house, and a lack of funds, convinces one Roommate, Lindsey, to think a third roommate is needed. The other Roommate, Erica, disagrees. On this day some potential roommates come by the house to check it out. When a fistfight breaks out between Lindsey and Erica, one of the potentials, Ariel, gets knocked down the basement steps, leaving her unconscious. Believing her dead, Lindsey and Erica decide to get rid of the body by bricking Ariel up in a large whole in the wall. When Ariel wakes up and discovers their plot, the tables get turned and they get a taste of their own medicine.
