The Incredible Voyage of Captain Hook

 An elderly wanderer is placed in a psychiatric institution upon being discovered drifting through traffic on a New Mexico interstate. A young psychiatrist becomes enchanted with this new patient when the man reveals himself to be none other then Captain James Hook. Through in-depth questioning, Hook reveals how he barely escaped Never Land after a maniacal bloodthirsty Peter Pan killed every last pirate aboard his ship. After he's institutionalized against his will, Hook is transformed from the fictional character whom he believed he was, into a man without a past, or so he is made to accept. The chilling outcome of the film involves the Captain pitted against that which he fears the most, the truth. What if everything you thought you knew was nothing more than a work of fiction? That's the question raised in The Incredible Voyage of Captain Hook. From start to finish the film takes you on the journey of one man struggling with his reality.
