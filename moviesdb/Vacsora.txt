Vacsora

 A day in the life of a small rural Hungarian family during the riots of September 2006. The day starts when the adult son of the family slips and falls during the morning feeding and is laying unconscious in the pigpen. The town also wakes up and goes about its business but without anyone noticing. As the day ends and the sun sets, the story also unwinds -- but not without the proverbial irony we know life to be.
