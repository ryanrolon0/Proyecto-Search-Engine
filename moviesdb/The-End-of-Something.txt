The End of Something

 When a waning audience base, encroaching urban development and a crippling economy threaten to shutter a small Black Box theater in Brooklyn, the remaining company members send out a call for help, bringing in old blood and gambling on new creative partners to put on one last show. Shot on location in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn, New York, and featuring a strong ensemble cast, 'The End of Something' is a funny, bittersweet look at what happens when romance, friendship and youthful dreams come to an end.
