Dr. Watson is growing increasingly concerned at Sherlock Holmes' use of cocaine and the fantasies they produce. The great detective's use of a 7% cocaine solution has led him to believe that Prof. Moriarty, who was his brother Mycroft's childhood tutor, is a criminal mastermind running the London underworld.

Under a pretext devised by Watson and Mycroft, Holmes, Watson and the ever trusty Toby set off to Vienna. Under Freud's care, he slowly and painfully goes through withdrawal. He doesn't fully revive however until he joins Freud in the strange case of Lola Deveraux, another of Freud's patients who was addicted to cocaine. When she is kidnapped, they set off to rescue her. In his final act, Freud also determines why Holmes is the man he is.
