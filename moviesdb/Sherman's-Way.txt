Sherman's Way

 An odd couple take to the open road. Having followed his girlfriend out to California's Wine Country for the summer, Yale law student Sherman finds himself dumped, and cut off from his high-society mother's money. A stranger stranded in a strange land, he hitches a ride with Palmer, a washed-up, unapologetically eccentric Olympic athlete. There are detours along the way, including the possibility of an enlightening girlfriend, an encounter with a gun-wielding gourmet chef and a chance for the former athlete to be on top again. A comedy about absent fathers and damaged sons striving to find balance between responsibility and recklessness. An eccentric Olympic has-been who prefers leisure to work, finds himself stuck with a rigid pre-law Yale student with no time for wasting time. Between skinny-dipping and stealing cars, this odd-couple learn from each other that balance is the key to getting the girl, getting the job and getting a life.
