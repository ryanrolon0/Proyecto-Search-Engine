Skånska mord - Esarparen

 Esarparen is a man who a long time wished death of his wife and suddenly is accused of murdering her. He protests his innocence. Does he speak the true or is he the man who could kill his own wife? Either that or is it a third possibility that bypassed both the court and the press?
