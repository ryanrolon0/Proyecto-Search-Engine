Under Secret Orders

 When a German spy realizes that he is being followed by British agents, he gives the secret information he is carrying to his girlfriend. When he is killed, she gives the information to his superiors, and herself becomes a spy, hoping to get revenge for his death. She is then sent on several dangerous and deadly missions during World War I that cause her to question whether what she is doing is right.
