Un an et un jour

 On a hot summer day, a young woman holds on to the memory of her kid daughter, who disappeared a year ago. In this desperate effort to keep her alive, somehow, past and present melt down into a timeless circuit, and reality fades into a stream of daydreams. As the little girl's face grows blurry and distant, what's really left of her presence? A hand gesture, whispered words of love, the dress she wore on that day really. But that shadow will not leave until her grieving mother comes back to life. A year and a day chronicles those magical hours when a sense of loss is accepted, as something both beyond repair and yet strangely peaceful.
