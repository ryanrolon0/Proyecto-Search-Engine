The Scent

 Richard Law wakes out of a coma with a degree of memory loss. He remembers his son, but not much of anything else. Things grow stranger when objects surrounding him spontaneously combust upon smelling his deceased wife's old perfume. Richard goes on an adventure to find out why this is happening; towards a past he is better off never remembering.
