The Bull Fight

 A young man takes his girlfriend to a bullfight where the toreador, matador and picadors all suffer defeat at the hands (uh - feet) of the bull. The gallant suitor enters the arena and wins a great victory, via grotesque cartoon imagery, and earns the plaudits of the crown and his girlfriend.
