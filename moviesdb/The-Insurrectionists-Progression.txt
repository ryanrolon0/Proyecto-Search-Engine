The Insurrectionists Progression

 A man dressed in many costumes walks through deserted areas of a city. He is accompanied by his son who is dressed in as many costumes as his father. On foot, and occasionally by Segway they go from place to place and carefully stack the loose things they find. In this way they build simple sculptural monuments. The day passes and a new day breaks. Early in the morning father and son build another pile.
