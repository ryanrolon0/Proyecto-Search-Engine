Tunnel Vision

 Tormented by waking nightmares of a traumatic childhood incident, Rachel, played by Nancy Hower (featured guest on Star Trek Voyager), finds herself increasingly alienated. Her boss sends her to survey a deserted industrial plant accompanied by her estranged husband (John Heffron) when they accidentally get trapped in the tunnels below. Separated, Rachel quickly finds out that they are not alone in the tunnels, but stalked by a shadowy figure intent on their destruction. Aided by a homeless girl (poignantly played by newcomer Sara Paxton), Rachel must overcome her childhood fears in order to survive. Tunnel Vision is an atmospheric and visual thriller full of allegory about learning to break free of the fears that bind us.
