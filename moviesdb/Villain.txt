Villain

 Using a much different style to his previous movies and shorts, Robert Benfer (Knox) sets out to tell the story of a Villain who retires from his job, using more realistic models, as opposed to his normal blue blob clay characters. A clay animation movie about Koil, a super villain, is caught by the police. After escaping prison he decides to quit his villain ways and to become a normal person. Every thing seems fine until his replacement villain is chosen and the city is in more danger than it has ever been.
