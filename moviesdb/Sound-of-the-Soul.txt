Sound of the Soul

 In a world increasingly polarized by religious conflicts and fundamentalist forces, SOUND OF THE SOUL is a timely, thought-provoking cinematic journey, reverberating with unity, understanding, and most of all, hope. Award-winning director Stephen Olsson's new film offers viewers a vivid, multi-layered portrait of both an open-minded Arab city and Morocco's Fez Festival of World Sacred Music - an exceptional event that invites Muslim, Christian and even Jewish men and women to perform in public at its historic sites. An inspiring antidote to spreading sectarian violence and global threats of a "clash of civilizations", SOUND OF THE SOUL ultimately reveals the essential connection between all religions and faiths.
