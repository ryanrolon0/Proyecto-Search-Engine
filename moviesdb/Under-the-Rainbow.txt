Under the Rainbow

 Six people go to the woods to take psychedelic drugs, where they find a mysterious leprechaun. They take the leprechaun home, but find the next morning that he's actually a battered little girl. Is this a leprechaun's trick, are they in for drug-induced doom, or might they still be lucky?
