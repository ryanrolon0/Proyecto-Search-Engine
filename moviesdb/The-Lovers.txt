The Lovers

 Transcending the boundaries of a love story, The Lovers transports viewers into a post-apocalyptic setting redolent with classic 1920s styling. A man and a woman explore their relationship within a metaphorical context, hinting at the art of RenE Magritte through a Dali-esque landscape. The film leads viewers using elements of Surrealism and features poetry by Gary Cummiskey. Stark cinematography and symmetrical framing add to a picturesque experience. The story remains open to individual subjective interpretation without compromising a strong narrative element.
