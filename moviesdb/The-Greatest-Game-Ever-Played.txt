The Greatest Game Ever Played

 The 1958 National Football League championship game between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants is known as "The Greatest Game Ever Played". It was the first (and only) professional football title game to ever result in an overtime, featured 17 men who were ultimately inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and included wild swings of momentum and the Colts execution of their two-minute drill to tie the game in the closing seconds of regulation time. To commemorate the 50th anniversary, ESPN films paired eleven of the games participants with current players from the Indianapolis Colts and New York Giants to compare the nature of the sport 50 years later, as well as sportscasters, reporters, photographers, spectators, cheerleaders, majorettes and marching band members who contributed their reminiscences.
