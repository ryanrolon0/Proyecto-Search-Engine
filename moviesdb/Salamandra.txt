Salamandra

 Argentina during military dictatorship in the early 80s life after being released from prison, Alba takes her six-year-old son Inti with her to a remote hippie village in the foothills of the Andes. She settles in the house of a deceased physician and indulges in marijuana and free love. Inti, looking for support, and the other children in the community are on their own. Finally, Alba no longer endures the wild, chaotic life in the community. She emerges a small cabin without water and electricity. Threatened and humiliated by local peasant children, mother and son try to establish themselves under simplest conditions and make a new life for themselves.
