Sleepfast

 Sleepfast is a psychological-horror about REM, an insomniac who suffers the bizarre effects of sleep deprivation. Unbeknown to the protagonist, he is undergoing a profound shift in consciousness through his sacramental, albeit reluctant practice of sleep-fasting. 'Life is something that happens when you can't get to sleep.' - Fran Liebowitz (1950)
