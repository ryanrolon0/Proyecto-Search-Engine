 Roy, a shy, solitary young man, calls himself a "non-winner," not a loser. He looks for signs that his life will change, and he gets just such a sign when he wins a haiku contest. His prize will arrive in two weeks, says the letter informing him of his win. He screws up the courage to tell Nancy, a colleague he likes, about his victory. He's impatient for the prize. Will it arrive? Is his life about to change?
