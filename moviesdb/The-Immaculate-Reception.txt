The Immaculate Reception

 When Hal and Molly, expecting their first baby, stumble into a movie where things aren't what they seem, Hal fears the unsavory images on the screen will affect the sexual future of his unborn son. When Molly goes into labor and they wind up just short of the hospital, it seems that Hal's worst fear...may not be so bad.
