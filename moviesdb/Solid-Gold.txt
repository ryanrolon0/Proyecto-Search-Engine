 In 1982 a fading porn star comes home to a hysterical phone message from the boyfriend he cheated on. He tries to laugh it off, but experiences an unexpected sense of emptiness. A week later, after being confronted with his mother's cynicism, he attempts to reconnect with the boyfriend by phone in the midst of the surreal atmosphere of a porn shoot.
