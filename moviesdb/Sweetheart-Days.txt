Sweetheart Days

 A teacher and a student fall in love, but the girl's parents catch them kissing and pull her out of school, sending her to a new one. The teacher is fired but manages to get a job at the girl's new school. Her parents find out and take her out of that school, too, advertising for a private tutor. The teacher disguises himself as an old man with whiskers and applies for the job, which the unknowing parents give him. Complications ensue.
