The Maniac Project

 In a world in which Maniac Killers are so plentiful that they regularly stumble upon one another and fight to the death, an evil mastermind identifies a financial opportunity. He begins to round up 9 of the most notorious killers to battle in a custom built, camera saturated, wooded arena. So begins The Maniac Project, the greatest, grind-house style, exploitation, snuff movie ever conceived.
