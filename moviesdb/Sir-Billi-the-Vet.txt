Sir Billi the Vet

 When tragedy strikes in the highlands, there can be only one Scotsman for the job - Sir William Sedgewick, aka Sir Billi! This is an adventure story about the power of a remote Scottish, but yet international community held together by the eccentric, skate-boarding veterinarian and their race to save an illegal fugitive - Bessie Boo the beaver! Sir Billi and the village clash with the law in their fight to rescue Bessie! As they brave treacherous ravines and hazardous waters in the battle to save the illegal beaver the question remains - who will get to her first? A roller coaster adventure, Sir Billi is undoubtedly the highland hero with a host of attractive traits. From the stereotypical Bond like characteristics, to a highland grandpa who still has a way with the ladies. His tartan dungarees are often seen navigating the narrow but dramatic highland roads, with a hint of showmanship and significant skill! A heart-warming and hilarious adventure, that takes you to the magical west coast highland village of Catterness in Scotland, where encounters with a goat who thinks he's a dog, an Admiral who's afraid of the water, a 'town temptress' for a Baroness and a beaver who was brought up by rabbits, are all just part of this crazy everyday highland fling. Sir Billi delivers the charm and panache that one would expect of a hero - a true 'Highlander'!
