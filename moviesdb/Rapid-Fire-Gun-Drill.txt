Rapid Fire Gun Drill

 "This picture shows the identical crew [as in the film Broadsword Drill] and the 1 pinder rapid fire gun on the superstructure of the cruiser 'Brooklyn,' which is credited with the greatest of hits in the naval battle which resulted in the destruction of the Spanish fleet off Santiago, Cuba. The gun is loaded and fired three times, each time being aimed in a different direction."
