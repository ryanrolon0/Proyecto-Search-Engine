The Rummy

 An incompetent and nearly illiterate man is fired at a taxi company. He sees a help wanted sign at a taxidermist and, thinking it has something to do with taxis, applies for a job. He's hired as the night watchman. Before the first night is over, he must deal with burglars, a mummy, a goose that needs stuffing, and an odd duck who claims to have a pet flea.
