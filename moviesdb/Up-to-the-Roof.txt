Up to the Roof

 Up to the Roof follows the journey of Mitchell Bundit - dreamer, visionary, loser - as he clumsily navigates the depths of a low-level industry schmooze party in a hopeless search for a backer to develop his film. When new starlet Naomi Packer arrives, Mitchell sees his only chance and seizes the moment. Armed only with a good heart and the noblest intentions, Mitchell courageously attempts a conversation with Naomi - and fails spectacularly - only to retreat in defeat to the rooftops above New York City where an encounter with a mysterious woman makes him realize that his passion to help people may come in another form than making movies.
