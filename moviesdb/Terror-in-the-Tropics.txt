Terror in the Tropics

 Terror in the Tropics is a loving tribute to Poverty Row studios of the 1930s and 1940s and stars Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney, Jr.. Feisty reporter Roz Darrow and photographer Ace Zucco travel aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise with the lovely Mary Ankers, who has been left an inheritance by a mysterious benefactor. The reading of the will takes place on the mysterious Fog Island. As their ocean journey progresses, they encounter a half-drowned sailor who tells a strange tale of Skull Island! The lovely and innocent Mary Ankers has been named a beneficiary in the will of a mysterious stranger, but to claim the money Mary must travel to the mysterious Fog Island where the will is to be read at midnight! Aboard the S.S. Enterprise, en route to Fog Island, Mary meets Madame Ouspenskaya, Count Vega, Edna Oliver and the handsome Grant Gardner. They too have been named in the will. Luckily Mary has sassy star reporter Roz Darrow and photographer "Ace" Zucco along to watch over her. Roz and Ace soon find their destiny colliding with that of P.I. Mike Flanigan, who is helping famed detective Mr. Wong. Flanigan and Wong are investigating a murder that occurred in the office of Merian C. Cooper on the RKO movie lot. Flanigan's gut tells him there is something sinister about the will and accompanies Roz, Mary and Ace to Fog Island. On the island they meet creepy doctors Armand and Vitus Tesla and their grim staff who have evil plans for Miss Mary. Can Mike Flanigan and Grant Gardner protect her from the Terror in the Tropics?
