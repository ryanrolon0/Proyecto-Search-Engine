The Wife Master

 Bora S. is a gay, unemployed 40 year old man who still lives at home. When his family kicks him out of the house, he must find a means to support himself. He reluctantly accepts his Uncle's offer of marrying a Cambodian woman so she can come to the United States in exchange for $10,000. When the money runs out, he marries another Cambodian wife, followed by another, and another... until he has more wives than he can handle.
