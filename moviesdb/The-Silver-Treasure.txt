The Silver Treasure

 Nostromo is the foreman of longshoremen in a South American Republic, and they are to load the cargo of silver that is to come from the San Tome mine. Sotillo and his band gang are plotting to steal the silver, but the fore-warned Nostromo has a plan to outwit them. He meets the silver train far up the road and has the shipment transferred to a big wagon, sending it via side-streets to the wharf. He and his men stay with the train and fight of the bandits. Back at the wharf, Nostromo thinks about claiming the silver was lost in the battle and taking it for himself. He and his conscience struggles mightily.
