Un week-end pour faire un film

 Michael wants to film Typhaine. To film means "to register images on a cine film". But it also means "become covered with a thin layer of something", such as meat in a shrink-wrapped tray. Michael has no intention of wrapping any meat; Michael wants to capture Typhaine on film, shrink-wrapped or not.
