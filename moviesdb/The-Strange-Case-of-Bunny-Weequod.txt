The Strange Case of Bunny Weequod

 Bunny Weequod is an Ojibway man who is concerned about the unusually large number of fish dying off in the local lake. That concern takes an unusual turn when his boat capsizes on the lake and he is presumed drowned. He suddenly re-emerges from the lake with an inexplicably sudden beard and even stranger behaviour. He and his wife and a female elder must get to the bottom of this mystery which has to do with traditional legends, learned in childhood, which have more relevance than they ever anticipated.
