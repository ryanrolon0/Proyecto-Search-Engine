The Good Scout

 A scoutmaster asks the boys in the troop to tell him about their good turns. Willie's attempts at good deeds are shown in flashback. He sees a dog with cans tied to its tail and cuts the tail with his pocket knife to remove the cans. He finds a bully picking on a small child and is rewarded for breaking up the fight by being punched by the bully's target. He lays his jacket over a puddle for an elderly woman crossing the street, but the puddle is so deep that the woman is drenched with mud. She chases the boy and tries to hit him with her umbrella. Finally, he successfully rescues a kidnapped girl and earns a merit badge.
