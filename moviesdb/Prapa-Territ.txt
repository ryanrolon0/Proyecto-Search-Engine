Prapa Territ

 The short length film 'Behind the Darkness' is a graduate project of the director Arben Tachi in the Academy of Art in Prishtina, Kosovo and it's running time is approximately 30 minutes. It's about our inner fears which can transform in various form if we can't find it's roots and that can be very dangerous because it leads to activities which we do unconsciously in our life. The problem of the protagonist of this film isn't in the presence of someone in his house where he lives alone, rather than in the absence of everyone.
