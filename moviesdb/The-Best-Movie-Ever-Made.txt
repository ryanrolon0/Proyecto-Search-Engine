The Best Movie Ever Made

 This comedy sketch conglomeration (in the tradition of "_Kentucky Fried Movie, The (1977)_ (qv)") is based on the idea that the viewer is watching cable TV and switching channels rather capriciously. Over a dozen separate sketches appear, but one particular sketch, "Battle for the Planet of Cheese" recurs in pieces again and again. "Battle for the Planet of Cheese" is a movie-within-a-movie which parodies "_Star Wars (1977)_ (qv)", "_Planet of the Apes (1968)_ (qv)", "_Aliens (1986)_ (qv)", "Star Trek (1976)" and many other science fiction films. Throughout the film the current "cable channel" appears on the screen every time a supposed channel change occurs.
