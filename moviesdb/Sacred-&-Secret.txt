Sacred & Secret

 The film is aspiring to capture Bali's constantly changing face in all its spirituality, complexity and polarity. At its core there will be the celestial cycle of a year on Bali as reflected in its ceremonies both sacred and secret that charge the island with its precious spiritual energy. Interwoven with this yearly cycle are the cycles of the soul from when the Balinese are born until the die, only to be reborn again.
