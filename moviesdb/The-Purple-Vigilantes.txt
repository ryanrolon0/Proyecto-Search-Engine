The Purple Vigilantes

 David Ross organizes the ranchers into a vigilante group to rid the town of outlaws. The plan succeeds but the trouble starts when some of the men form a new vigilante group and posing as the original one plunder for loot. In the 14th film in this series, the lawless conditions in the town of Trail's End leads to the law-abiding citizen to organize a vigilante group (wearing purple hoods and robes)and clean the town up. Once accomplished, several unscrupulous members see an opportunity, add a few members, and begin their own reign of terror for profit, while framing Dave Ross, the original founder, as leader of the gang. The Three Mesquiteers (Stony Brooke, Tucson Smith and Lullaby Joslin) can clear him, but they are ambushed on the way to the trial.
