Unfinished

 One afternoon, a man is accosted in a gallery by a young, rebellious woman with wild opinions about the art on display. Rebel writer Graham Thompkins has his say about the plight of the artist through this clever story about two patrons and their unpredictable -- and very personal -- response to art. UNFINISHED is surprising and hilarious, unfolding what artists secretly find haunting - even torturous.
