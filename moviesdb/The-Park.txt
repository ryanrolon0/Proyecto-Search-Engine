The Park

 The Park is a short film inspired by the science fiction work and theories of Philip K. Dick; the author of Blade Runner, Total Recall & Minority Report. Set in the alternate world between death and rebirth, The Park follows a soul as it is transported between family members over a simultaneous linear time-line. It raises the questions of just how connected one might be to the spirit, and; if that force could exist in one place over several observed realities within an immediate family, how would it react if it was given the ability to remember? Ultimately, would the spirit challenge it's own fate?
