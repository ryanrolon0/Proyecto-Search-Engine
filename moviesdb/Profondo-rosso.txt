Profondo Rosso

 Luigi Cozzi, the retired director of such B-movie classics as Starcrash and The Killer Must Kill Again, talks from the famous Profondo Rosso shop in Rome - which he runs with Dario Argento - about the establishment's genesis and its continued success. He also gives a guided tour of the shop's museum, speaking about the various movies which the props come from (each prop is highlighted by film footage). This short biography was made for the Deep Red DVD and Blu Ray, released nationwide in the UK by Arrow Films on January 3rd 2011.
