Spinning Daisies

 A hilarious, heart-breaking, coming-of-age comedy about self-discovery and family acceptance. Mourning their parents death, quirky siblings Chris and Liz plan a family get-together. Their other brother, David (recently out of the closet) is scheduled to show. Little do the other family members know, Chris and Liz have planned a "gay intervention" for David, in hopes to bring the family back together after the shocking death of their parents. Liz's son, Jason, doesn't seem a likely candidate to play hero, but he shakes off his awkwardness and saves the day.
