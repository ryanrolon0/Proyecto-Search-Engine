The Empire Builders

 A bizarre couple and their seventeen-year-old daughter are trapped in a block of flats in the middle of nowhere. A horrible and unexplainable sound converts their life into a nightmare. The film is based on Boris Vian's same title play which is a classic example of Theater of The Absurd. With the permission of the Vian family in France, we are the first Filmmakers to adapt this play onto film. See attached letters from the Vian Estate.
