The Belly of the Beast

 Over 2000 years ago, the 12 Apostles of Christ were warned that one day Satan would retaliate against God, for casting he and his Angels into hell, so the Apostles each made a special Dagger to kill each of Satan's 12 equivalent Demons, he has unleashed to re-stake his claim. That day has come, as was written in the Books of Revelations. However, direct-Blood-line Descendants of the Apostles, called the 'Alpha Disciples', have collected the Daggers passed-down through time, and come together to take-on Satan's deadly Cult of Gothic Demons, before ALL of hell's demons are released upon the earth. During the life of Christ, it was foretold that an evil would mass against all the Earth and unleash the reign of Satan on man. The apostles made 12 daggers that were blessed with the might and love of God to battle this evil when the time came. Adam Simeon is the leader of the Alpha disciples, 12 descendants of the Apostles, a man whose faith is stronger then his fears. He finds Bill Hillman, an ex cop whose daughter has been taken, Reece Mondo a detective, and his brother Aaron ready to battle the dark disciples of Satan.
