Three Daughters of the West

 The cowboys belonging to the Crescent Bar outfit, while out looking for missing cattle, catch a gang of rustlers in the act of running off their employer's stock. Charley Morton, the foreman, immediately starts for the ranch to inform the ranch owner, and the cowboys pursue the fleeing cattle thieves. Jim Darrow, the ranch owner, is the father of three lovely girls, true daughters of the West, who are fond of hunting and all outdoor sports. They have just succeeded in obtaining their father's consent to go hunting, when the foreman arrives with his news. Charley warns his sweetheart, Bessie Darrow, that hunting in the hills is dangerous while the rustlers are about. He rides away with his employer to join the boys in running down the rustlers, and the girls are left alone. Clara and Ellen prepare to carry out their original intention to go into the hills and hunt deer, but Bessie, remembering her lover's warning, is more prudent and advises her sisters to stay home. The two younger girls prevail and they start for the hills. In the meantime, Darrow and his foreman join the cowboys and start to look for the rustlers. Safely hidden among the rocks, the outlaws watch the searching party ride by their hiding place and start for the open plains beyond. After they are gone, the rustlers emerge and start on the back trail. They see the ranchman's daughters coming in the distance and plan to eke out their vengeance on the girls.
