The Final Stage

 It was a normal day for the man and the woman of the house. They had breakfast and he read a newspaper. Then he decided to leave for the office. Trouble is, there wasn't any office any more. Things had happened. Things beyond his control. There would be no more journeys into the outside world for the man. Unfortunately, the outside world began calling on him. Loud, obnoxious, funny and sometimes scary people all arrived unannounced. Some were familiar from a shared past, some were strangers. A failed musician, an actor friend and a street thug. Each with a story to tell. All thought they knew the man and woman of the house. They were determined not to leave the living room until the truth about the past had been laid bare for all to see. And put to rest.
