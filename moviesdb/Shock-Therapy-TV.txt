Shock Therapy TV

 Take a ride on the lunatic fridge where the Hockey Mask Killer has lost his touch, Jesus can't get passed God's passive-aggressive secretary, cats ruin good men's lives, trees talk, vacuum cleaners think for themselves, kids are scary, and The Prince of Space roams free. Shock Therapy TV is The Twilight Zone of Comedy.
