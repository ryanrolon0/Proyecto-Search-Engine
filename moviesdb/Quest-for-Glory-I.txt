Quest for Glory I

 The valley of Spielburg is under a curse. The Baron upset a nasty Ogress named Baba Yaga, who cursed the land. However, for every curse, there is an equal and opposite countercurse. Hoping to find someone, anyone, to break the curse that has lost his son and daughter, the Baron advertises for a hero with "no experience necessary" to come to the valley of Spielburg. Then, came a man from the east, just as the countercurse says. Is he the prophecised hero, or just another wannabe? Will he save the Baron's children and restore Spielburg to it's idyllic state? Only time will tell.
