Tales of a Western Drifter

 Tales of a Western Drifter captures five surreal short stories, opening the door to subcultures that live on the fringes of society. From the windows of Vienna's red-light district on a rainy night to a former Air Force Academy drop-out living by Denver's rail yards, Tales of a Western Drifter is an experimental documentary.
