Vacanze in America

 A group of students from the San Crispino school for boys take a holiday in the United States, traveling from New York trough Utah all the way to Los Angeles. Young Father Don Buro (Christian De Sica) has great difficulty controlling the youngsters, especially with trouble making ex-student Peo (Jerry Calà) along for the trip, and finds himself distracted by the attractive single mother of one of the boys (Edwige Fenech).
