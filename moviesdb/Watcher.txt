Watcher

 Having just split with her husband of 10 years, Karen and her daughter Rebecca have bought a home in a picturesque little country town, in hopes of starting over. The people are warm and welcoming, and the old farmhouse is nice and affordable. But before long, Karen and Rebecca begin to experience troubling disturbances; noises in the walls wake them from sleep, while Rebecca keeps insisting there is an animal in the walls with "red eyes." The disconcerting truth begins to overwhelm Karen... something wicked is afoot. Watcher tells the classic "monster in the closet" story with a twist - the horrifying ending will be sure to shock you.
