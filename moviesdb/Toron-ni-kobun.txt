Toron ni kobun

 In a world covered by endless water, dastardly sky pirates search the small, outlaying patches of land for anything they can steal. On just such a mission, Teasel Bonne was kidnapped by the henchmen of a greedy loan shark. Now Teasel's sister Tron must pillage Ryship Island and pay off Teasel's astronomical debt.
