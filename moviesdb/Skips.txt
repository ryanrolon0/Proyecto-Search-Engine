Skips

 Sandy is a 13 year old who can't decide whether its more important to be hanging with his buddies or to start pursuing Darlene, the girl who's caught his eye. When he and his buddies tease Darlene about wearing "skips" (generic tennis shoes) he decides he must go and apologize but things go horribly wrong.
