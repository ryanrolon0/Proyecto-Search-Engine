Rose Murray

 Rose Murray is a self made photographer who, in this film, describes her motivation, style and methods. Through the techniques of split-screen and photo montage combined with un-staged interviews, we are presented with images of an independent woman artist, continuing to produce vital works in the golden years of her life. Rose's work takes us back through the years for a fascinating view of Kingston, Jamaica where she lived during the 60's and 70's.
