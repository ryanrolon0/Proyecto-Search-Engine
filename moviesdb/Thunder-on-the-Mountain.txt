Thunder on the Mountain

 The the generally dormant volcanic mountain chain which lies between North and south America is filled with beauty and life. In the 1400's wooden ships were seen approaching and the changes began. Now ships of metal and glass appear and the changes continue.These days people from all over the world lay claims to this land. But every morning, and every evening, the jungle comes alive with primal screams and howls. The beasts that rule the jungle at night, will not let it be forgotten, that this land once belonged to them.
