The Ugly King

 Far away from the rest of the world is the most beautiful land. The only thing that mars this perfect world is the King. He is so ugly that at 23 he is shut up in a big castle with a few devoted servants and no mirrors. No damsel - fair, dark, young, old or otherwise - wants the job of Queen. Sadly, these otherwise beautiful damsels are quite rude. The King's rejection coincides with more disaster. Cook goes down with bunions and a sympathetic single mum answers the wanted ad. Predictably, the King and the new cook become engaged. Although the King's appearance does not change, his smile makes him attractive and everyone gladly attends the magnificent wedding.
