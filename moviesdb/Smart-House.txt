Smart House

 Meet the Coopers. An average American family. Meet dad, a widower and a father. Meet Angie, and Ben the big older brother. He's the mom of the family. The Coopers win a "house of the future" with a Cyber housemaid PAT or Personal Appiled Technology. PATs great for throwing' great parties and making sure the family runs smoothly. But when Dad starts going out with Sara, the person who created the house, Ben programs PAT to act more motherly. So his father won't think they need a Mother. But the house goes whack. And it's up to Sara and Ben to work together and defeat a very Smart house. A 13 year old boy wins a computerized home manned by a cyborg maid named PAT. When he and his dad move into the house, he figures that his dad will cease considering re-marrying anyone since the house and PAT can handle all of the cooking and cleaning chores. However, his father soon shows an interest in the computer programmer. This sets the boy into tinkering with PAT's program and sets in motion a too wife (and mother)-like nagging robot.
