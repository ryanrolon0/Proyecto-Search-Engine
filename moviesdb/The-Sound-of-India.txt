The Sound of India

 India is a country with uncountable facets - always in a change between tradition and modernity. The liberalization of the country to the west not only affects the economy, but also the people and their cultural interests. "The Sound of India - a musical culture on the move" is a documentary about this effect on the music in the small Indian metropolis Pune. But the film not only shows how the music changes - it also shows the people making this music and what they think about living in a society that is "on the move".
