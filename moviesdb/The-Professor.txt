The Professor

 In a meager, one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of New York City lives a quiet, old man who was once President of an African nation. Former law professor and Supreme Court justice David D. Kpormakpor served as Interim President of Liberia between 1994-95, during its disastrous civil war. "Prof" now lives alone, on welfare, among thousands of other Liberian refugees, many of whom question why he did not simply take the money and run when he had the chance. An unforgettable, lyrical portrait of a decent man, The Professor ultimately reflects upon the nature of honor and character in an often unjust world.
