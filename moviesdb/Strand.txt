Strand

 A bond between nostalgia and physical reality, the liquid phase produced by the condensation of Stream of consciousness will evolve through the film and manifests itself using images and sounds. STRAND perhaps is a personal journey in memory and time using human models, landscapes and cityscapes of Iran in order to explore the emotion hidden in past and future.
