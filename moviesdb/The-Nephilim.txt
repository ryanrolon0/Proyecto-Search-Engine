The Nephilim

 It's been threatening for years, tensions rising, the truce being challenged and tested. The pieces are falling into place; war is inevitable now as the forces of good and evil prepare for a rip roaring raging battle to end all others, and finally decide on the fate of the earth and its human inhabitants... Since the beginning of time the balance of good and evil has been kept through a truce between the forces of the Titans and the evil Eros army. The world has been left in blissful ignorance, believing humans to be the dominant force on earth, until now. War is inevitable, the end is nigh, and who ever ends victoriously may not have anything left to save or destroy!
