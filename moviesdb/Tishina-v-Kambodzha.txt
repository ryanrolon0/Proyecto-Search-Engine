Tishina v Kambodzha

 This film is about the mission of the Bulgarian Battalion in Cambodia. This is the autumn of 1992. The Khmere Rouge were still not shooting at Bulgarian then. It was precisely eight days before the first death in the Battalion. A film is based on personal experience, in which the authors reveal an unknown life, with an attention to alien motives, with an attempt to explain things unacceptable at first sight.
