Seven Keys to Baldpate

 Writer Kenneth Magee has bet that he can finish a story at rural resort Baldpate Inn, now closed for the winter. The owner has given him the "only" key to the front door. But there are six other keys, and peculiar characters, some of them up to no good, keep turning up as the mystery deepens. Mystery writer Kenneth Magee bets a friend that he can complete his newest book in the quiet of Baldpate, a remote, shuttered inn isolated by New England snows. His friend sends Mary Jordan there with orders to keep Magee from winning the bet, and she begins by stealing his manuscript. Magee believes he has the only key to Baldpate but a sinister-looking man named Gargan, claiming to be the caretaker, also has a key. Mary also has one, but Hermy the Hermit doesn't need one as he uses a drain-pipe next to a window. While Magee endeavors to complete his novel, other mysterious people, including Connie Lane, come and go, each with their own key. He thinks it is all part of his friend's prank, until various people are killed, bodies disappear and reappear, and he actually touches some real blood.
