The Old Livingston House

 Cory and Summer had just met near the Ocala National Forest when they stumble across what appears to be a treasure map. They soon find out the leader of a local biker gang believes it belongs to him and is determined to take if from them. When an Ocala lawyer who is addicted to a computer game shows up in the area, it's hard to know who is chasing who. The clues don't seem to make a lot of sense but everything comes together inside the creepy old Livingston house.
