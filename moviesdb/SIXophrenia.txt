 A man awakes in a cuboid rock space. He is uncertain how he came to be there. He searches for his way home. He ventures from the cuboid world into suburbia. He notices that any houses with the numbers of 7, 8, 9 or 0 have disappeared. To add to his woes, he has a phobia of yellow trucks. He stumbles home. His calender is missing the numbers 7, 8, 9 and 0. Even the television has those channels missing. He searches for an explanation of these numerological aberrations.
