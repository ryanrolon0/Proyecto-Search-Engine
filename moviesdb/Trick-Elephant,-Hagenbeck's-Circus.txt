Trick Elephant, Hagenbeck's Circus

 Here is a picture that will not alone amuse but interest everybody. A huge elephant performs tricks on a small pedestal and one wonders how he can stand on it as it appears only large enough for one of his immense feet. He is trained by a lady who is an artist in her business.
