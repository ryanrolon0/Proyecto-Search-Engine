Wait 'Til Next Year

 Using the frame of opening day, 2006, this documentary examines the Cubs' 100 years without a World Series title. Between conversations with a half-dozen selected Cubs fans in 2006, the film looks back at the Wrigley years (father and son), sale to the Trib, and coming oh-so-close in 1945, 1969, 1984, and 2003. Great players, including Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, Ron Santo, and Ryne Sandberg, are profiled or interviewed. Wrigley Field's special feel is celebrated. But the real attention of the film is on what it means to be a Cubs fan, especially at those moments when hope springs or when victory slips away.
