The Fat Man and the Treacherous Springboard

 "The fat man is in swimming, and asks a pretty Summer girl to give him a cigarette in order that he may show her a diving trick. She is fully attired in a summer gown, but heedlessly walks out on a springboard. The fat man reaches up and pulls down the springboard in order to get the cigarette; but his hand slips, and the board flies up, throwing the Summer girl into the air and into the water with a terrific splash."
