Smiths

 If The Smiths had called it a day after Meat Is Murder, and never released The Queen Is Dead, they would surely still be seen as one of the finest British bands ever - a perpetual legacy was assured soon after their second album. But on June 16th 1986, when the band released their third record proper, they entered an exclusive league that grants new membership once a decade at best. This DVD is a visual review of this groundbreaking record, it's writing, recording, production, release and legacy. Showing for the first time how it all came together and what made it so great, the film is all at once hugely enlightening, downright entertaining, and remains the only visual document of this momentous happening ever released. Features Include rare footage of The Smiths, studio and live recordings of every track on the album, revealing interviews with band members and many others who worked with them on the record, footage of and comment on the pivotal influences on the music and lyrics, and comment, criticism and review from; Engineer and co-producer of Q.I.D, .Stephen Street; Manchester legend, the sorely missed Tony Wilson [RIP], 'The 'fifth smith' guitarist Craig Gannon; Author of Morrissey and Marr Editor and Smiths champion, Len Browne; Head Of English at Clare College, Cambridge, Professor Steven Logan; From Suede, the Smiths inspired, Brett Anderson; Author of Morrissey Hopps; Guitar instructor, musician and journalist (Guitar Magazine), Douglas Noble and legendary Smiths' road manager and all-round raconteur, Grant Showbiz.
