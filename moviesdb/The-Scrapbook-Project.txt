The Scrapbook Project

 The Scrapbook Project is a combination of documentary and snowboard film from Finland. In addition to snowboarding we capture what is happening behind the scenes, and in making of a snowboarding movie. We also show what is it like to be a professional snowboarder, with all the ups and downs, not just the final tricks that end up in the film. The movie presents the pros and the talented up-coming stars of Finnish snowboarding scene. We will take you on a journey to show where the Finnish pros are coming from. Movie begins in fall and ends in summer showing all of the four seasons in Finland. Genuine Lapland culture and lifestyle are going to have their own place in this production. Besides Lapland we have chosen other exotic filming locations around the world.
