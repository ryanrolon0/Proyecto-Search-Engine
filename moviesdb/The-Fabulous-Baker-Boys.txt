The Fabulous Baker Boys

 Frank and Jack Baker are professional musicians who play small clubs. They play schmaltzy music and have never needed a day job. Times are changing and dates are becoming more difficult to get so they interview female singers. They finally decide on Susie Diamond, a former 'escort' who needs some refinement, but the act begins to take off again. While the act is now successful, both Frank and Jack have problems with their life on the road. Susie becomes the agent that makes them re-evaluate where they are going, and how honest they have been with each other. Brothers Jack and Frank Baker have been playing lounges as a piano duo for many years but decide they now need a female vocalist to keep the act going. They are lucky to come across Susie Diamond, who can really put a song over, and the act takes off. But when the relation between Susie and Jack - younger, less committed, but more talented than Frank - briefly becomes more than professional, tensions surface between all three. Frank and Jack Baker are two piano players and brothers. Moreover, they play together in small pubs and clubs all over the country for 15 years. But when their business is not doing so well, they decide to join a woman to their shows. After the auditions, the best candidate they could find was Susie Diamond, and from now on their shows become very successful. But when Jack and Susie are having an affair, the fabulous Baker brothers are not getting along anymore, and the little band is about to break down.
