Rhineland

 Set in March, 1945 during the battle known as "The last great killing ground in the west", RHINELAND tells the story of a young replacement thrown into an under-strength mine platoon. A burned-out lieutenant and a bitter sergeant are his only guides as he struggles to come to terms with the brutality of war during the final bloody months of World War II.
