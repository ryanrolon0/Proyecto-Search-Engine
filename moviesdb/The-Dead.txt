The Dead

 The film is an updated version of James Joyce's short story, detailing a small house party at the Morkan sisters' residence, attended by friends and family. Among the visiting attendees are the sisters' nephew Gabriel and his wife Gretta. The evening's reminiscences bring up various interesting and a bit comedic conversations. Before the end of the evening, melancholy events & memories arise.
