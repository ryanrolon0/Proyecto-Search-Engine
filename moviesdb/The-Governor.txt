The Governor

 The Governor is a noir love story set amidst the abject solitude of the sex industry. Tortured escort driver John Dorian has practiced his trade for longer than he'd care to remember. He doesn't mind the sleaze around him -- sleaze is all he knows. Thrust into working with new escort, Gwen Miller, John forms a partnership with her based on his self-defined 'rules'. Through their dealings, Gwen's empathy and naivetE gradually softens John, sending his fragile world into a tailspin of violent and devastating consequences.
