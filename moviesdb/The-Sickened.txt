The Sickened

 Present day. Jessie Hill returns to the sleepy border town of Opportunity, Arizona to make amends for her criminal past. She hopes to reunite and reconcile with her family, especially with her father, the local sheriff. But a highly communicable designer virus has been unwittingly unleashed which causes people to behave like predatory pack animals. Can Jessie save her family, and her town, or will The Sickened overrun us all?
