Prisoners of the Casbah

 A typical Sam Katzman sand-and-sandals saga that is better than his later "Harem Scarum" only because this one doesn't have Elvis Presley. Gloria Grahame is the princess, Turhan Bey is the Captain of the Guard and Cesar Romero is the oily villain who has his sights set on Gloria and her father's throne. Romero and his henchmen cause Gloria, disguised as a boy (what a waste!), and Turhan to flee to the Casbah, where they plot to strike back at Romero.
