The Struggle for Existence

 A documentary film that examines two museums-the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the newly founded Creation Museum in Cincinnati-and their very different approaches to science. Through a survey of museum exhibits and exclusive interviews with staff members, the film explores both the scientific method as well as biblically based creation science and shows how the museums' respective methodologies affect the conclusions they reach on numerous subjects, including dinosaurs, evolution, and the age of the Earth.
