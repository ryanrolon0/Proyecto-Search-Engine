Unfiltered

 A worldly young female teen, Sherri, moves to a small southern town with a dried up marijuana supply and a Narcotics cop that's under surveillance by the FBI. Sherri falls for the cop's son, whose mother has recently fallen mysteriously from a ladder to her death. Attempting to assimilate she's befriended by a group of teens whose idea of fun, is getting high and playing the "brick game" - (an old initiation game where the new kid is asked to throw a brick at a young black kid). As Sherri attempts to circumnavigate this mentality and find her place she is brought deeper into the racism, corruption and sociological dysfunction of the south.
