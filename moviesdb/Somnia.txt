Somnia

 Les (Joe Kurtz) is a hypochondriac who self diagnoses. Right now his life is not going the way he wants and he gets brushed aside all too easy. Now he thinks he has insomnia on top of it all. When his Doctor gives him a new drug to help him get some sleep, he takes too many and dives deep into himself and from that realizes what he has to do to get what he wants in life.
