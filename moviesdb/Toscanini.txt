Toscanini

 This is a documentary on the career of the great maestro (perhaps intended as a rebuttal to the controversial book "Understanding Toscanini", which was being written at the same time that the documentary first aired. PBS aired it in 1988, a year after the book hit the stores.). The documentary features clips from several of Toscanini's television appearances, as well as from his only film appearance in 1943. It also includes rare color home movie footage of not only Toscanini, but Salzburg in the 1930's during the Salzburg festival, as well as interviews with some of the surviving musicians, singers, and recording technicians who worked with him.
