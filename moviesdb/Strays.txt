Strays

 A quiet film about Tommy, a young Iraq war vet, returning to small town Minnesota to meet his new girlfriend's father, a prominent Lutheran pastor. The economic stratification of this rural community weighs on Tommy as he encounters people from his past and a sheltered opinion of war and social class. After surviving a tour of duty, he must now prove his worth to his girlfriends father, the one person who should openly welcome a returning vet.
