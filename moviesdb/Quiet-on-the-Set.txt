Quiet on the Set

 David Thorn, an out of control off-off-off-Broadway theatre director from the Bronx, is given the chance to direct his first independent feature film based on his autobiography. However, his unstable methods eventually cause the production to crumble. A small film crew documents the filming process as well as the six month later aftermath with the director and his personal assistant.
