The Ballad of Crowfoot

 Using entirely still photographs from the Nineteenth Century, a folk sings a song about the great Blackfoot Chief of the Canadian West, Crowfoot. It tells his story as the rise of a great warrior, but he was unable to protect his people from the treachery and the exploitation of the White civilization who were bent on stealing their land and subduing them.
