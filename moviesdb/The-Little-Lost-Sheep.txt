The Little Lost Sheep

 Little Bo Peep discovers that one of her sheep-students is missing when she counts noses at school. The missing lamb is wandering in the woods and is tricked by the big-bad-wolf into going to the wolf's favorite picnic grounds. Miss Bo Peep enlists the services of detective Krazy Kat, and he and his blood-hounds rescue the victim.
