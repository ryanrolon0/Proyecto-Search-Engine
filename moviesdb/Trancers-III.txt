Trancers III

 A time traveling cop, Jack Deth, from the future is taken back to the past to be given the task of destroying the Trancer program before it has a chance to get out of control, sending the world into a state of chaos and war. Jack was just beginning to get his life back together after the last trancer incident. Now he's been timejacked back to 2247 in order to save Angel City from a new wave of trancers. His mission - find the origin of this new wave of trancers, and destroy it. With the help of Lena and R.J., a trancer camp escapee, Jack learns that the new trancer program is government sponsored, and that his usual shoot-everything-that-moves attitude might not work this time. With R.J. and Shark, a crystal powered cyborg-type thing, Deth will have to find a way inside the trancer program and shut and down.
