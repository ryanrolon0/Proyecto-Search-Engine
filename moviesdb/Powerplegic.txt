Powerplegic

 Jeremy Moore, a computer genius, was brutally mangled by a vicious gang. The outcome of this savage act causes Jeremy to become a quadriplegic. However, unbeknownst to the young genius, he has developed telekinesis. Through his new-found powers he let's out a fury of revenge. This spawned 'POWERPLEGIC'.
