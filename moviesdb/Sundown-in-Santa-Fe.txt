Sundown in Santa Fe

 A dagger has been left in every robbery by Walter Durant, fugitive leader of the President Lincoln murder ring. Rocky is sent to Santa Fe to find Durant and arrest him and the gang of outlaws he controls. Rocky soon finds that the information for every robbery comes from Tom, who is the son of the sheriff. But Rocky has to arrest the whole gang, and he does not know who is part of the gang and where Durant may be hiding. Army Intelligence is trying to track down the evil genius they think was behind the plot that led to the assassination of President Lincoln, and they think he is in the Santa Fe area, which is being plagued by robberies and murders and, at the scene of each crime, a dagger bearing the inscription "Sic Semper Tyrannis" is found. Special-investigator "Rocky" Lane is assigned to the case. A rancher's daughter, Lola Gilette, uses her feminine wiles on the sheriff's son, Tom Wyatt, to keep her and her father, Tracy Gilette, both working for the "Sic Semper Tyrannis" villain, clear of any activity by the law that might endanger any activities of their own.
