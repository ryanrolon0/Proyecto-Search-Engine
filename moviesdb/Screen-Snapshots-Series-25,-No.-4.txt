Screen Snapshots Series 25, No. 4

 This Snapshots (production number 7854) hits the sports trail and begins with many members of Hollywood's English colony demonstrating how Cricket should be played (by aging actors who can't run), and then ends up with shots from one of Bing Crosby's golfing clambakes for charity.
