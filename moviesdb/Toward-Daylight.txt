Toward Daylight

 Suicide is never the final word for those left behind. It alters lives forever and crosses all human boundaries. 'Lost and Found' struggles to kindle the hope necessary for the living to face and move on from the pain and loss of suicide. This film combines the stories of five people, all struggling with an experience of suicide. Survivors must find hope after being abandoned in the most tragic way. Those who have survived an attempt to end their lives are challenged with avoiding risk factors and building a better life. Anger, guilt, shame and grief all contribute to the stigma and silence surrounding suicide. Breaking that silence is the purpose of this film.
