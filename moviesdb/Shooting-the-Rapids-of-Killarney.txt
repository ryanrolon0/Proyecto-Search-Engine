Shooting the Rapids of Killarney

 A most interesting picture, showing several boats laden with passengers passing through the rapids and waving their hats to the audience. In the foreground we see the old wire bridge, well-known to every Irish-born and visited by everybody who travels through Ireland. The boats pass through this bridge. The scenery is one of the most beautiful ever seen, and the picture will make a great hit wherever shown.
