Rocío de La Mancha

 Rocío and her four brothers live in La Mancha village; without work, they win a few coins from tourists that stop by to see the view, showing them an old windmill and convincing them that it was the same that Don Quijote had fought in the old days. (Quijote being a literary, not an historical character). By chance, she meets a couple in difficulties, as the wife refuses to accept that her daughter died recently. The man asks her to pass as the missing daughter, in an attempt to get the wife interested in life again. Telling lies was her job, so Rocío accepts, knows a luxury life in Paris, but then one problem compounds with another, one lie leads to another, and the young woman doesn't know how to sort things out.
