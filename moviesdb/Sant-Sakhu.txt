Sant Sakhu

 A woman-centered saint film and a family melodrama. Sakhu (Wadkar), a Marathi Saint poet whose existence is mainly legendary as opposed to the better-documented male ones. She is depicted as a devoutly religious woman married to a weak husband (Kulkarni) and oppressed by her cruel husband (Kulkarni) and oppressed by her cruel mother-in-law Mhalsakaku (Gauri) and sister-in-law Durga (Majumdar). Recognition comes at the end of the film through a series of miracles (including the classic scene where she is tied to a pillar, her disembodied death and reincarnation). At the end the 'real' Sakhu confronts her divine stand-in to confuse everyone in the village and to attract charges of being a ghost.
