The Child Cannot Speak

 A film maker's personal journey into her family's unspoken past. Now that even her self-selected group of late-blooming friends are having children, the filmmaker wonders if the reason she has not yet started a family of her own, is perhaps tied to her family's history. That's why 25 years after making a playful family TV show with her cousin, Maaike Holvast set out once more to interview her family members. She is determined to find out if there was anything else behind the innocent facade of their childhood home video. 'The Child Cannot Speak' is a deeply personal realization about the need for family and the things we do to in order to keep it together. The making of the film was filmmakers own therapeutic discovery that the effects of sexual abuse and neglect reach farther then the first generation involved. Working on the film not only helped the filmmaker understand her relationship to her family's history, it also was the first step in breaking a longtime silence, thus creating room for understanding, forgiveness and new positive feelings about the concept of family.
