Sabaka

 Gunga Ram, a young elephant trainer, swears vengeance on the killers of his sister Indria and her husband on the orders of the religious fire-cult leaders, the High Priestess and Ashok. The Maharajah of Bakore disbelieves him and Gunga Ram is also opposed by the Maharajah's General Pollegar. Gunga Ram sets out to expose and destroy the fire shrine of Sabaka.
