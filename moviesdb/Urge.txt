Urge

 Dr. Bolting, a quack who makes self-help tapes, narrates and frames this off-beat comedy set in 1980s Manhattan. His unusual patients suffer from imbecility, paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and fits of spontaneous orgasms and combustion. Unable to keep a lid on their insane urges, the doctor soon loses his own mind.
