 In response to the bad rap the word feminism has gained in recent years, this film explores the history of second wave feminism in New Zealand by focusing on a number of women, including an anti-war activist, a sexologist, a journalist and a lesbian writer who all appeared in the television series Women in 1976 which explored the 'feminism of the day'.f Now 28 years later, this film follows the lives of those same women interweaving their personal histories with that of the social history of feminism.
