Salud

 SALUD examines the relationship between an alcoholic womanizer named 'Carlos' and his young son 'Junito.' Carlos finds himself seven years too late, in trying to reunite with the child's mother 'Mimi,' who divorced the young father for being unfaithful. When depression and disillusionment overtake him, he slowly descends into a hazy, downward spiral of booze addiction. Eight year old Junito's refusal to lose his father to the bottle becomes a powerful struggle which leads both father and son to discover the true and sometimes painful meaning of unconditional love.
