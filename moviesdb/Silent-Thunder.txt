Silent Thunder

 "Silent Thunder" is the heartwarming story of Stanford Addison American Elder, Spiritual Leader, Horse Tamer, and Quadriplegic. By means of his unique method of gentling wild horses, Stanford delivers a subtle yet timely message of universal peace and cultural tolerance as he casually inspires viewers to seek spiritual consciousness and individual awareness through sharing the experiences of his own life. Stanford irrevocably teaches us that life is greater than it appears and our problems are not as big as they seem.
