Spoils of War

 In the turbulent '60s, starry-eyed activists Andrew and Elise (Heard, Nelligan) fell in love briefly before going their separate ways, and their son Martin (Maguire) has lived with his nomadic mother ever since. When her latest whim leads them back home to New York City and the old circle of friends, a now-teenaged Martin's natural curiosity fuels his inclination to contact the father he has never really known. Though it takes little time to locate him, reforging a relationship could take much longer, and it's bound to be complicated by old feuds, painful wounds, friends' lingering resentment, and Andrew's new girlfriend.
