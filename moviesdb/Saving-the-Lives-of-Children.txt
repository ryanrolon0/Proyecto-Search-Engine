Saving the Lives of Children

 A series of monologues tell the tales in an underground school for young people left behind by the system. Forgotten by their caretakers, the abused, neglected and addicted find a place to go to find refuge from the hardships of the streets. Some overcome - some lose - some are still fighting.
