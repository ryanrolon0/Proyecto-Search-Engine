Race for Atlantis

 The mythical city of Atlantis has risen from the depths in The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, and champions are being called from around the empire to Race for Atlantis, the world's first giant-screen Imax 3-D ride. The effect created is an unbelievable chariot race through the streets of Atlantis, where the diabolical Ghastlius will stop at nothing to win.
