This Will All Make Perfect Sense Someday

 Los Angeles, 1999 A young man, days before he is to leave for art school in Japan, meets his perfect girl. He's eager to confess his immediate, undeniable love for her, except he doesn't know what to say or how to say it. In the end, he does nothing, and he never sees her again. The encounter is brief but even years later he is haunted by the thought of "what might have been". So, the man takes the feelings of regret, and renders it into a fable about fate and lost memory perhaps he is free from the burden of not being able to change it.
