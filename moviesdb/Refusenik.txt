Refusenik

 Refusenik chronicles the thirty-year international movement to free Soviet Jews. The first retrospective film about the movement, it has been called a "seminal" work on the subject. Told through the eyes of activists on both sides of the Iron Curtain - many whom survived punishment in Soviet Gulag labor camps - the film is a tapestry of first person accounts of heroism, sacrifice, and ultimately, liberation.
