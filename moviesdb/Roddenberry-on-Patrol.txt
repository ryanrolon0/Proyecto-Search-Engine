Roddenberry on Patrol

 This story takes a funny look at a time when Gene Roddenberry was working in Los Angeles in the late 60's as a motorcycle cop, writing part time for TV westerns, and pitching his new series concept, "Star Trek." The story takes place over the period of a week or so as Roddenberry's character encounters several personaltiies, sights and sounds that eventually become part of the orginal "Star Trek" series lore.
