The musical performances include a duet with Jessica and Jewel, who sings her classic song, "Who Will Save Your Soul," and a duet with Nick and Babyface singing the Stevie Wonder classic, "For Once in My Life." Jessica also performed "Islands in the Stream" with the legendary Kenny Rogers. Comedy sketches include a hilarious skit with Mr. T, and Jessica and Nick dropping in on Kermit and Miss Piggy, who are taping their own variety show on the same stage. Also, Nick's hometown hero, Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famer Johnny Bench, drops in to teach Jessica how to hit like a pro.
