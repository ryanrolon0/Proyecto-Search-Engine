The Inside Job

 After five years of loyal service Tony "The Bag Man" Lopez is missing with Alphonso D"Amico's $50,000.00. A meager sum, D'Amico decides to send his youngest son "Allie Boy" to find Bags and collect the 50 large. Unfortunately for Allie, Bags speaks very little English-even less when he's strapped down to a table with zip ties!
