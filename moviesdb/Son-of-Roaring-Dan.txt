Son of Roaring Dan

 One of Thorndyke's men has murdered a man and Eris is the only witness. Jim Reardon breaks up Thorndyke's first attempt to kidnap Eris but the second attempt is successful, Jim now not only has to find Eris but has to get her back in time for the trial. In this vaguely-similar remake of Hoot Gibson's silent version from Universal, Jim Reardon, seeking the man who murdered his father, poses as Horace McPhail, long-absent son of rancher "Roaring Dan" McPhail. The old man assigns Tick Belden and his sister, Jane, the task of teaching the "tenderfoot" how to take care of himself in the rough frontier country. In Tiger Bend, Jim discovers Thorndyke, his father's killer. Thorndyke heads a gang of rustlers and when Eris Brooke, visiting New York dEbutante, witnesses a killing, Thorndyke orders her kidnapping. Jim and Tick rescue her and bring her to the courthouse as star witness against Thorndyke's henchmen. Thorndyke and his men turn their guns on Jim, Tick, "Roaring Dan" and his cowhands (mostly the KCBS-Texas Rangers band members.) Thorndyke is captured by Jim. McPhail admits he knew all the time Jim wasn't his son Horace (who, evidently, was about the same caliber as John Wayne's clumsy son Horace in "True Grit"), but adds he is proud to have Jim known as the son of Roaring Dan.
