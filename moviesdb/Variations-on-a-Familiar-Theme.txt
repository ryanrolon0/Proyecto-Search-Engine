Variations on a Familiar Theme

 Single-parent, same-sex, blended, common-law, disabled, inter-cultural, traditional...today's family defies definition. Meet Löic, who has two mothers and no father. VEronique and Marcel have children whose voices they cannot hear. Helen, who lost and subsequently recovered her children, counsels Native families in crisis. Through portraits of seven very different families, this engaging documentary shows that, no matter what form it may take, the family is still the mainstay of the individual.
