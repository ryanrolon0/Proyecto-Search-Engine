The Gene Kelly Show

 Gene Kelly's first TV special finds him dancing with three European ballerinas; performing with two youngsters, Liza Minnelli & Cherylene Lee from "Flower Drum Song;" and dancing to a Carl Sandburg's "A Poem To Dance To," written for this show. Nelson Riddle contributes an original composition called "Jam Session" which serves as a production number.
