Reservations

 On the roof of a Manhattan hotel, Helen, a flight attendant with cancer, meets Marc, a depressed actor. Below, Marketa, a young Czech woman connects with Marlene, a Cuban maid as they struggle to communicate. Brendan, 7, mistakenly dials a sex hot-line, connecting with a lonely operator and Hallie, a runaway shares an encounter with a Danish businessman, neither will forget. Drifting through the hotel we find these strangers connecting in moments of compassion and hope.
