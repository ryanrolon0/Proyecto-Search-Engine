Ripples

 In this world, no one is a stranger. In "Ripples," eleven people's lives are changed for better or for worse. The film is set in New York, a place where it's possible to live for 80 years and never see the same person twice. The story begins when Janet, a young woman, witnesses the gruesome death of her boyfriend, Ken. Following the accident, she's asked her account of the incident by detective James Harrison, a man who has a solid grip on his job, but is helplessly watching his marriage fall apart. James' estranged wife, Grace, learns she has become pregnant, but hesitates before letting him know the good news. Over the next year, Janet sparks two new relationships; one with her new neighbor, Jason  and another with a struggling actor named Othello. While trying to make it to a casting audition, Othello makes an unexpected friend, Tyrell , a psychiatrist who feels no sympathy for his own patients. Unknowingly, this encounter would lead to an event that would forever change the lives of James and Glenn, a bartender at a local establishment. "Ripples" asks the question, is life freewill or destiny?
