Unaccustomed As We Are

 Oliver invites his friend Stanley over for a nice home-cooked meal, but Mrs. Hardy wants nothing to do with it and walks out. Mrs. Kennedy, Oliver's beautiful neighbor from across the hall, volunteers to help out, but the boys' bumbling soon has her dress on fire. Her husband, a policeman, investigates the ruckus just as Oliver gets the now partially-unclad Mrs. Kennedy hidden in a trunk. Kennedy's boasting of how he handles his own womanizing backfires when his wife pops out of the trunk and blackens his eye. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hardy has returned and wonders what all the noise is coming from next door. Oliver surprises his wife by bringing his pal, Stanley, home for dinner. After exploding at both men, Mrs. Hardy leaves them to fend for themselves. Mrs. Kennedy from across the hall tries to help them, which ends up being misunderstood by Mr. Kennedy, a jealous police officer!
