Separate Tables

 It's the off-season at the lonely Beauregard Hotel in Bournemoth, and only the long-term tenants are still in residence. Life at the Beauregard is stirred up, however, when the beautiful Ann Shankland arrives to see her alcoholic ex-husband, John Malcolm, who is secretly engaged to Pat Cooper, the woman who runs the hotel. Meanwhile, snobbish Mrs Railton-Bell discovers that the kindly if rather doddering Major Pollock is not what he appears to be. The news is particularly shocking for her frail daughter, Sibyl, who is secretly in love with the Major. A look into the lives of several residents at a seaside hotel where guest have their meals at separate tables. John Malcolm is a hard-drinking man, engaged to the hotel owner Pat Cooper. His life is turned upside down however when a former love, Ann Shankland shows up after she hears of his engagement. She clearly wants him back but he sees nothing positive that can result from renewing their relationship. There is the domineering Mrs. Railton-Bell, a highly opinionated woman and her meek, sexless daughter Sybil. Finally, there is Major Angus Pollock who is constantly telling stories from his days in the war. Sybil has taken a liking to the man but her mother warns her to stay away from him. Her warnings appear warranted when they read in the newspaper that he was convicted of lewd conduct in a movie theatre.
