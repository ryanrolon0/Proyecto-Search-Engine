The Suburbanite

 A family with several children is moving into a nice new home outside of the city. Their enthusiasm is dimmed somewhat when the furniture movers arrive, and damage some of their belongings. In their new surroundings, it proves difficult to keep track of the children, and it is also hard to get suitable household help. But their problems in the new home hardly end there.
