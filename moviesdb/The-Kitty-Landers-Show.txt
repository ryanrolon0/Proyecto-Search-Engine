The Kitty Landers Show

 Every episode, we'll visit Kitty Landers, a free-spirited Bohemian artist, from her eclectic home in Venice Beach. Her high-powered imagination will continuously get her into hot water, but she prevails with the help of her cast of creative, off-beat guests, including half-sister, Philippe, her high-strung, gourmet chef neighbor, Old Man MacGruder, her curmudgeonly landlord and beat poet, Fumiko, her high-styling, Japanese designer buddy, and Muffy, her best friend and "dancing queen machine." Kitty discovers some valuable life lessons and finds new ways to entertain and inspire by staying true to the show's irresistible motto In the pilot episode, a camera crew arrives at the Venice Beach home of Kitty Landers, a free-spirited artist who can best be described as a cross between Holly Golightly and Pippi Longstocking. Gretchen, a determined, by-the-book producer, attempts to document a day in Kitty's off-beat life, which is highlighted by an impressive line-up of special guests, including Lucy, her super-genius half-sister, Philippe, her high-strung, gourmet chef neighbor, Old Man MacGruder, her curmudgeonly landlord and beat poet, Fumiko, her high-styling, Japanese designer buddy, Muffy, her best friend and "dancing queen machine" and her rock band pals who happen to use her bathroom as a rehearsal space. After picking her daily fortune from Sergio, her very own Fortune Cookie Tree, Kitty pledges to heed his sage advice "Don't shame one's name by playing the blame game." Despite her heartfelt promise, it isn't long before she makes the mistake of blaming all of her wrongdoings on The Idge, a made-up creature that she claims has "a horn made of loose pocket change and both ears on one side of his head." When The Idge suddenly bursts out of her closet, demanding that she clear his name, Kitty must swallow her pride and confess to her friends that it was her, and not the Idge, who accidentally ruined their prized possessions. Her friends happily forgive her, stating that friendship is based on honesty and understanding, and assure her to never ever be afraid to tell them the truth. In celebration of Kitty's first show, the whole cast busts a move as the bathroom band debuts their sensational, new hit, "The Kitty Landers Show" theme song.
