Silverlake Video

 Based on true events. Ben, a regular guy, on the verge of losing his video store, has one day to get a business partner before his lease expires. His day takes a turn for the worse, when his "out of his league" girlfriend leaves a message, proclaiming "We need to talk". With no where else to turn for moral support, he opens up a Pandora's Box, when he seeks advice from the local flavor of the neighborhood, Silverlake.
