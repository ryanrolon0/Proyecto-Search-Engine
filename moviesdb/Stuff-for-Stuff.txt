Stuff for Stuff

 This short begins with a history of economics, starting with the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians. The narrator stresses that throughout history, free trade among nations has been the engine that drives prosperity and democracy. When protectionist policies are put into effect, everybody suffers. It was these protectionist policies that caused the Great Depression and led to the rise of tyrants after World War I. The film closes by extolling the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after World War II.
