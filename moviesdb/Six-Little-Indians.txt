Six Little Indians

 In a last ditch effort to make peace with his demons, a dying man gathers together five of his childhood friends addict, a tortured artist, a father on the verge of losing his kids and a corrupt cop, and forces them to return to the secluded mountainside where they covered up the death of a young boy twenty years ago. While searching the wooded area for the boy's shallow grave, the six men disperse, only to find that one of their own has gone missing. With their vehicles rendered useless by an unseen hand, tempers begin to flare, accusations fly and the men soon come to the conclusion that there is a killer in their midst. But things are not as they seem. Vowing not to leave one another's sight until dawn, the remaining members of the group enigmatically come to their own demise, one by one, leaving the last two men convinced that a vengeful, supernatural force is responsible for the killings. With daylight pending and terror mounting, the two men discover that someone in the group was not who they claimed to be and if they have any chance of surviving, they must work together and find a way off the mountain before they suffer the same fate as their friends.
