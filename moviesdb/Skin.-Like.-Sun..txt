Skin. Like. Sun.

 We all know what sex looks like. Many movies have tried to capture the magic, but most can only bring home the tricks. This movie allows you to participate where others leave you the unsatisfied peeping tom. It dares to share the slowness. In a unique twist, this film is edited in nearly real-time. As real-life couple Wim and Floor spend an afternoon in the sunwashed rooms of an old house in Belgium, the camera simply follows. In the slowness, we get the build, the sweetness, and the sexiness. Forget about fingersnapping fast editing. Slow is where it's at. This film was conceived as a feminist collaboration between erotic film director Jennifer Lyon Bell and artist/DJ/author/lingerie-designer Murielle Scherre, aka La Fille D'O. They created it for the feminist Stout(st)e Dromen Festival in Antwerp, Belgium.
