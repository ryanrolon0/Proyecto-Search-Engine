The Tricorn

 An imaginative portrait of a futuristic concrete experiment of a shopping centre ('the ugliest building in the world' according to Prince Charles), built in the 1960s coastal town of Portsmouth, England. Loved or loathed, it developed a passionate cult following of artists and skateboarders but has now lost the battle for life. By the time of this screening, it will be ripped down.
