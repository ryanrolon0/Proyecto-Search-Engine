The Experience Box

 Set in Bohemian New York and inhabited by ambitious artists of every medium, The Experience Box tells the story of three friends and the extreme measures they take to re-invigorate their languishing creative lives. Led astray by 'experience junkie' Jerome, his friends Anna and Julian soon find themselves embroiled in a wicked web of deceit - and up to their eyeballs in glorious inspiration. Anna secures a child from Julian without asking - and finds out that her therapist wants to be the father. Jerome, after auditioning for a porn filmmaker loses his 'soul-mate', but gains the treasures of the muse - and a sugar daddy. And Julian meets his fantasy woman on the Internet - only to find she doesn't really exist...
