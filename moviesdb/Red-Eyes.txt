Red Eyes

 A single mother and her daughter living in a house in the woods puts her child to bed one night. As the mother is preparing her child for bedtime, the child asks her mother a question. 'Is there a such thing as monsters?'This one question ironically foreshadows the mother on an unexpected encounter with a real one while on a late night walk through the woods. What would you do if you met one yourself?
