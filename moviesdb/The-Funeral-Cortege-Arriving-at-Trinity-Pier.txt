The Funeral Cortege Arriving at Trinity Pier

 This subject was secured from a position of exceptional importance, and is of a most pathetic interest. In it the scene of the removal of the remains of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, from the shore of her Island Home, is faithfully portrayed. An excellent view of the gun carriage carrying the coffin, covered with the pall, surmounted by the crown and sceptre, is obtained. Also the removal of the coffin to the "Alberta," by the picked group of bluejackets. The King, Kaiser, Duke of Connaught and Royal Princesses following in a sorrowing, mourning procession, is also of sad interest. The background of Her Majesty's Grenadiers, with bowed heads and reversed rifles, served to accentuate the solemnity of the funeral, whilst beyond is shown the "silent highway" upon which all that was mortal of our beloved Queen was borne to its final resting place.
