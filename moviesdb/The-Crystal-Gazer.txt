The Crystal Gazer

 A theatre-crowd is gathered to listen to Zaza Raja, a renowned mystic, who answers all questions regarding people's life and future. In response to a question from a young girl in the audience, the psychic goes wonder-gazing into his crystal ball and visions ancient Egypt. In search of the answer to the question, he wanders off into the tombs of the ancient Pharaohs, where many mummies held him solve the riddle of the young lady's future. But, when Zaza Raja snaps out of his spell, he finds he has forgotten the answer. He also finds the theater audience is none too pleased about it.
