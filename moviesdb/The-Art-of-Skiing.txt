The Art of Skiing

 Goofy, staying at the Sugar Bowl resort, demonstrates the basics of downhill skiing, which the titles and announcer insist is pronounced "SHEEing". The equipment is, of course, of the era. As you can imagine, Goofy has much trouble keeping his skis parallel and pointing downhill. The final ski jump conveniently lands Goofy right back in bed. While a dignified off-screen voice goes trough the winter sports manual for the noble, classy sport of skiing, ever-bumbling Goofey consistently demonstrates in the Sugar Bowl resort there's not only a good and a lesser way to do things, he always finds one even worse, from getting up and dressed -skis first, trousers last!- to putting every foot wrong and in the worst place, either up and down the mountain by gravity or ski-lift (falling off so he's hammered into the ground) or launched from the jump-ramp, so as to make more falls and bad landings in an exhausting day then most stuntmen in a month, with less grace then a scarecrow.
