Redeemed

 REDEEMED is a day in the life of a young woman, as she reflects upon the joy of her new love. Magnified by a comparison of painful, past relationships, joy is soon followed by revelation. The young woman must then decide whether or not to check her relationship baggage at the door and embrace spiritual healing.
