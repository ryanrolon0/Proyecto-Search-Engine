Shikari

 A drama involving feuding "businessmen", which takes place between India, and South Africa (Cape Town), "Shikari" follows the action of businessman turned fugitive, Srivastav, who aided by a mask assumes a new identity, Mahendra Singh, the "king of spices," and flees to South Africa. Mahendra Singh's self-appointed title irritates the reigning spice tycoon, Virendra Singh Rawal. Thus, the problems begin. Om Srivastav and Rajeshwari Rawal are in love, and would like to get married. Rajeshwari introduces Om to her mom, who approves of him. When she discusses Om with her sister-in-law, Suman, she is told that Om is not a good man, and she should keep away from him. Rajeshwari finds out that Suman had been in love with Om, and their romance did not last long, and she feels that Suman is being bitter now. But Rajeshwari will soon find that the truth lies elsewhere, in South Africa, where they all re-locate, and where they will spend the rest of their lives in hiding, running from a deranged man, who is out to hunt and kill them - one by one.
