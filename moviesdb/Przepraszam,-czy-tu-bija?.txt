Przepraszam, czy tu bija?

 The film is a story of a young man coerced into undercover work for the police, in return for their dropping of charges against him. He is to befriend a leader of a gang of juvenile delinquents who plans big robbery of a jewelry store. The scheme works and the gang is caught in the act except the gang leader. In the final roof-top sequence when both of them flee from the police, the young man, after a brief hesitation, kicks his partner off the roof into police hands.
