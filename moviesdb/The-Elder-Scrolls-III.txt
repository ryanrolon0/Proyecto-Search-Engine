The Elder Scrolls III

 On the island of Morrowind, the native 'Dark Elves' maintain an uneasy relationship with each other, and with the ruling Empire. The mythical Ghostgate - said to protect the island and the rest of the world from a great evil - is beginning to weaken, and local beasts and other monstrosities are increasingly becoming common in the land, with no clear end in sight. The three God-Kings of Morrowind have taken to their private abodes, refusing to walk and talk amongst the people they've served. In the midst of all this, an Imperial prisoner of unknown parentage is shipped to this ancient island, given a small stipend, and told to talk to a man in a nearby town. Life on Morrowind - and of the world of Tamriel - is about to change.
