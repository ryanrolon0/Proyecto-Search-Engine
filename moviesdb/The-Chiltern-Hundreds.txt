The Chiltern Hundreds

 Young viscount Pym manages to to get an army leave on the pretense of running for the Conservatives in the next local election. His only aim in fact is to marry June,a rich American heiress, before she returns to America. Due to unexpected circumstances he is driven to take part in the election campaign but loses the vote. Humiliated, Tony must win June Back, so why not stand again, as a... Socialist this time!?
