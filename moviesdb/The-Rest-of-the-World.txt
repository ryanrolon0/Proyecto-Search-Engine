The Rest of the World

 An anti-war video using the mix of music, spoken word and effects found on Tribe's earlier works. 'The Rest of the World' sees her characters and ideas fully developed and presented. The video opens with a quote from Barbara Bush backed by the response tapes from FDNY on 9/11. ThenvTribe moves into a performance of 'Quiet My Soul', a depiction of the God of War decrying the misuse of his role in life, that displays her formidable stage presence. On the last word from War, a simple 'please', the video rises into the harsh, trance backed performance of the title piece 'the Rest of the World'. In which she challenges the viewers to participate in their lives to change the story that will be told.
