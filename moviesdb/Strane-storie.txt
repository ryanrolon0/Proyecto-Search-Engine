Strane storie

 During a train journey, to please his bored daughter, a father tells her three stories. In the first a man discovers that, because he hasn't payed the air-bill, he can't breath any more. The run to the air-office is full of problems. In the second a lonely woman buys in a supermarket a man marked "tender". When she comes to know that the "product" is out of date, she gives it back furiously. In the third story the natural antipathy between two families, who differ by social status, geographical and cultural origin, becomes worse and worse, until a true war. In the end the train stops in the countryside, the passengers get down curiously, and discover the rest of the "Italicus", a train destroyed by a bomb in the 70's. The true responsibles were never discovered
