Vivah

 After the passing away of his wife, wealthy Delhi-based businessman, Harishchandra, took it upon himself to bring up two sons, Sunil and Prem. When they grew up he got Sunil married to Bhavna, and let Prem complete his education, even let him study abroad. Soon Sunil and Bhavna gave birth to a son, Rahul. When Bhagat told him that he had found a suitable match for Prem in Poonam, the niece of Krishnakant, a fruit merchant from Madhupur, Uttar Pradesh, the family traveled there, met with Krishnakant, his wife, Rama, and daughter, Rajni, and instantly approved of Poonam. Prem and Poonam also approved of each other, the Astrologer was consulted and a marriage was scheduled to take place in six months time. Shortly thereafter the engagement took place. The two families met again in Som Sarovar, Nainital, to let everyone get acquainted, and when Prem got his first contract from Japan, Krishnakant took his family to Delhi to celebrate. With the deadline for the marriage drawing close, both families start their respective preparations - not knowing that fate may have other plans in store for this young couple. Pooja (Rao) is an orphan, having come into her uncle Krishna Kant's (Alok Nath) household after her parents' death. He considers her a "gift", speaking of his aim in life being to nurture this daughter and to marry her off. Pooja lives with her Chacha(uncle) and Chachi (Seema Biswas) and their daughter Choti (Anjali Prakash). The aunt doesn't love Pooja much, because Pooja is prettier than Choti. However the loving Chacha arranges a match for Pooja with the son of a wealthy, industrialist family from Delhi. Where Prem (Shahid Kapoor) is the magnanimous bride-groom, who decides that he will spend a month of each year at his wife's parents' home, well-brought up Pooja is the perfect shudh Hindi speaking addition to the clan. The marriage day draws closer, but a fire in Krishna Kant's house will put Pooja and Prem's well-behaved love to the test . . .
