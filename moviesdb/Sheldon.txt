Sheldon

 Follows the life and times of former children's television sensation Sheldon Shellstein. Down on his luck following a string of public scandals, Sheldon is tailed by an unseen documentary crew as he struggles to make his way back into the limelight. First stop? An ill-fated guest appearance at an amateur wrestling exposition. This surprisingly touching and hysterical four and a half minute short film is equal parts Avenue Q and The Wrestler.
