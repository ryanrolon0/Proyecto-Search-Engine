So This Guy Walks Into a Bar...

 A guy with the looks, clothes, and attitude of a lounge lizard notices a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, sitting alone. He brings her another of the blue drinks with paper parasol that she's just finished. She asks him to sit. He's Dylan, she's Lilith. Every time she touches him, his mind stops. She talks, he's spellbound. She leans over and kisses him. What's her game?
