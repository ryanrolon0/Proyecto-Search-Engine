Running Ragged, Running Scared

 Every year, thousands of healthy American horses provide European and Asian palates with a much sought-after delicacy. These 'living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west' are routinely crowded into double-decker transports - enduring hours without food, water or rest - and driven to Mexico where they're slaughtered and their meat sold for human consumption. This documentary depicts how a nation that was built on the backs of horses, has watched as their use has turned to abuse.
