Sunshine Superman

 I met the most perfect person in the history of perfect people, or in the history of ever for that matter. She was today, she was tomorrow, and she was yesterday. She was the catalyst for my ideas, my secrets, and all of my dreams. I was eight years old, and I remember the day that I met her, not like it was yesterday, but like it's today.
