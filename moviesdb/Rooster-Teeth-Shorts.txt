Rooster Teeth Shorts

 Since the hit machinima series Red vs. Blue is made entirely out of video game footage, you'd think that the people at Rooster Teeth Productions might have a pretty good career out of playing Xbox most of the time. But when the cameras are turned on the show's creators, it turns out that a lot more happens than you think. In a blend of a behind-the-scenes mockumentary and sketch comedy, the Rooster Teeth crew present twenty tales of office mishaps, beginning with a voice-acting session gone horribly wrong and just getting worse from there.
