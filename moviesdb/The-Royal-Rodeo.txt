The Royal Rodeo

 In the small European country of Avania, the King, who is only a child, is more interested in the arriving American cowboy show led by Bill Stevens than he is about affairs of the state. After meeting Bill, the King requests that a rodeo be held at the castle. The two begin a friendship based on Bill seeing in the King what he himself was like when he was a child. When the Regent of Avania abducts the King and his governess Marianne in an elaborate and widespread conspiracy to overthrow the King, Stevens puts on a real live wild west show to save the pair and maintain the monarchy as it should be. In doing so, Bill also hopes to demonstrate a wider perspective of life the American way. In the tiny European country of Arvania, the king is a young boy who is enthralled with the magazine adventures of American cowboy Bill Stevens. When Stevens and his Wild West Show pay a visit to Arvania, the king is delighted. But the wily Regent plots to kidnap the king and take his place as ruler. But he has not reckoned on the king's new cowboy pal.
