A crooked businessman attempts to buy it but the inventor refuses to sell it to him, whereupon the rejected businessman and his henchmen steals the plane and its blueprints. The plane's test pilot, who is the boyfriend of the inventor's daughter, and his sidekick set out to get the plane, and the plans, back.
