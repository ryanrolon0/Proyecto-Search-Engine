Two Days 'Til Iraq

 A tense, personal and unscripted account of a young British fireman's last visit with his Middle Eastern family, 48 hours before he is deployed to Iraq. Neil is a fireman in the Royal Air Force. He enlisted because he passionately wanted to be a fireman and was unable to get a job as a civilian fire fighter. He now finds himself caught up in the Iraq war where he will face a different kind of fire. He wanted to be a fireman to save lives, and now he is going to fight a war. Like so many young people in the armed forces, he is there by default, by virtue of the fact that he had no viable career alternative. Neil is also Shahin Afnan's son. This thought provoking piece was shot during Neil's farewell visit before deployment with his mother, grandfather, uncle and aunt in London, England.
