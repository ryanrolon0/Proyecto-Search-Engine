The Love of the West

 Jack Whitcomb, who has been out West for some time making his fortune, receives a letter from his sweetheart in the city, saying that she will soon join him. The day for her arrival has come and Jack goes to meet her. He escorts his sweetheart to his home and introduces her to his mother and his friends. Everything is made beautiful for her, and she expresses a feeling of happiness. A week later, Alice begins to show signs of homesickness. This is more exemplified when she receives a letter from her girl chum, saying that she is having a good time going to balls, parties, etc. This message makes her long for the city and its wonderful sights even more.
