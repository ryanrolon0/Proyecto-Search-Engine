Ultima Parada

 After two years of travelling across the whole of Africa, Godspower, a Liberian immigrant, finds himself stuck in the Moroccan city of Tangier. Neither is he able to return as a failure to his country or is he able to reach the European shores, just (or "only") a few kilometers away, at the other side of the Strait of Gibraltar. At the end of his rope, Godspower will discover new energies to keep fighting for his goals.
