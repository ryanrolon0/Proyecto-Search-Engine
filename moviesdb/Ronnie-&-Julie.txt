Ronnie & Julie

 Capulet becomes Cappell, and Montague becomes Monroe in yet another modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's classic "Romeo & Juliet." This time, the adult family members are feuding by way of a mayoral election, while Ronnie & Julie are the ice-skating lovers (he in hockey, and she as a figure skater.)
