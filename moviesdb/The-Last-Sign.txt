The Last Sign

 Andie MacDowell portrays a woman who is tormented by the ghost of her abusive, alcoholic husband. She must come to terms with the past if she is to find peace and love. Samuel le Bihan is a French engineer who she finds renewed love with and Tim Roth plays her deceased husband who shows us that hate can live on after death. Perhaps forgiveness is the only way to overcome the demons that haunt us from the grave.
