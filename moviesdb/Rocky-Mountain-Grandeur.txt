Rocky Mountain Grandeur

 This entry in the narrated travelogue series is accompanied by traditional country music inspired by springtime in the Rocky Mountains. While geologists find a wealth of fossils in these mountains, tourists observe the majestic natural beauty of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. The tourists also enjoy one of the many nearby rustic settlements called dude ranches, where modern city dwellers get a taste of simpler life. There's demonstrations of bronco busting and horse roundups, swimming in mountain lakes, horseback riding on mountain trails, and outdoor camping among the grandeur of the Rockies.
