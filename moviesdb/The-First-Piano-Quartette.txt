The First Piano Quartette

 Another of the CinemaScope shorts in Technicolor that 20th Century-Fox churned out in a hurry to get them booked with their CinemaScope features to make a full bill of CinemaScope in theatres. The 1st Piano Quartette (Adan Garner, Edward Edson, Frank Mittler and Glauco D'Attilli)play Lecuona's "Malaguena", Debussy's "Clair de Lune" and John Phillip Sousa's "The Stars and Stripes Forever." As with a few others, house-man Otto Lang produced and directed, or took a credit more likely belonging to the cameraman or editor.
