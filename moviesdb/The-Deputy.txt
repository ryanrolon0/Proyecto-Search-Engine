The Deputy

 Centres on the life of a fictional Deputy Prime Minister of the British parliament, Bob Galway. Surrounded by inefficiency and corruption in the cut-throat world of Westminster, Galway strives to keep his work and his personal life in order while staying one step ahead of his adversaries, in particular the conniving Steven Sharples.
