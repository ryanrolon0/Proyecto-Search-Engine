The Bequest

 Jenibel Heath, while returning to bury her father at the remote island hotel she grew up at, is involved in a considerable car accident. A twenty-three-year old law student, she has not been back since her mother's horrific suicide, eight years earlier. Struggling to pay for school and live in New York, her goal is to bury her father and quickly get what she needs to sell his hotel. Her plans are complicated though by head trauma she has suffered during the accident, a past relationship with the son of the hotels manager, and the spirit of her deceased mother and father. Within two days of being back at the Manitou Hotel, Jenibel is fighting to maintain her sanity and ultimately to stay alive.
