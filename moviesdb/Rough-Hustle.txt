Rough Hustle

 In Las Vegas, a city where most men lose their last hope, Dean arrives to discover redemption. Strung out behind him are a series of half-baked endeavors and failed relationships. He has turned his back on everything from the military to Wall Street. Now, in the dingy hotels and bars of Vegas he begins to build a life that, for the first time, he doesn't want to walk out on. He develops unlikely friendships as he builds a raggedly endearing team of "card counters". These men are not characterized by their "genius" or undeniable "con-man" potential, rather they are loyal and hard-working...blue-collar workers with a street-smart eye for detail. This is not the Vegas of penthouse suites and high-rollers, this is the unrefined glamor of every man's Sin City. The story is uniquely told by the normally faceless people behind the scenes hustlers who bond together trying to live the dream in a rough town called Las Vegas.
