Through Destiny's Lens

 Two Angels, Destiny and Temptation, wager on the goodness of human nature. Destiny gives Chrissy a camera that takes pictures of the future. Her only advice is to USE IT FOR GOOD. But Temptation has other guidance. Will Chrissy fall to temptation or will she help save a kidnapped girl? Is mankind basically good or as Temptation believes rotten to the core?
