 Adam fled NY, and his marriage to Sam, three months ago without explanation. What does it mean for two men to be married to one another? Are the rules the same? Sam has just arrived in San Francisco to see if he can put his marriage back together. We spend a few days with them to see if they can and become hopeful that they will.
