Them Thar Hills

 Stan and Ollie take a trip into the mountains ('the high multitude') so that Ollie can recover from gout. Bootleggers have dumped their moonshine in the well from which the boys sample their 'healthy' mountain water. Mr Hall, who has left his wife with the boys while he re-fuels his car is not amused at his wife's condition when he returns.
