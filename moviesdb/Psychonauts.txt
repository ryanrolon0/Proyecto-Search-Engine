Psychonauts

 Against his father's wishes, a young psychic prodigy named Razputin ("Raz" for short) leaves his life in the circus and sneaks into Whispering Rock, a summer camp where young psychics like him can learn to use their powers, and maybe someday become "Psychonauts", psychic secret agents who battle the forces of evil. Raz manages to impress the camp's head counselor, Morceau Oleander, as well as visiting Psychonauts Sasha Nein and Milla Vodello, who agree to let him stay... but only until his father comes to pick him up. But something's amiss at Whispering Rock stealing the brains from Raz's fellow campers, leaving them mindless, TV-obsessed zombies. Raz decides to put his growing arsenal of psychic powers to good use and investigate the strange goings-on. Along the way, he'll journey into the minds of those around him, and face perils ranging from mad scientists to giant monsters to the psychotic mental constructs lurking within the deranged minds of insane asylum inmates, and thwart an evil plot for world domination. Razputin, Raz for short, is a 10 year old boy who lives at a circus with a family who do not approve of his psychic powers, and when the pamphlet for Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp comes around, his parents refuse to let him go, so Raz runs away and crashes the camp. Coach Oleander and Psychonauts Milla Vodello and Sasha Nein decide to let him stay... but only until his father comes to pick him up. Raz decides to take the time to get stuck in, but while he's getting settled in and meeting his fellow campers and learning basic psychic skills, there is a far more sinister plot underway... which might just involve Raz. When flung into an unusual situation, Raz must venture not only away from the camp, but into the unusual worlds that are other people's minds, and help them combat their problems on his quest to win a certain girl's heart and save the world from an insane genius...
