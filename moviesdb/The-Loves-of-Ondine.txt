The Loves of Ondine

 Ondine is a gay man attempting to re-adjust his sexuality via various encounters with different women. After trying his luck with three women, Ondine becomes a background character in a sequence in which a group of Latin American men, calling themselves The Bananas, engage in a food fight. Ondine then engages in a wrestling match with 'Joe Dallesandro' (qv), who is married to 'Brigid Berlin' (qv).
