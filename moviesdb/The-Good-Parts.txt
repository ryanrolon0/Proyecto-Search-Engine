The Good Parts

 Rob Flannigan (played by Mikiah Umbertis) blinks one morning in the shower and finds that he has skipped forward three hours. His shins hurt, he's hungry, and the water is cold. Has he gone crazy? He meets the beautiful Jennifer (played by Monique Dupree), the opposite of him in every respect. Jennifer can stretch her perception of time, slowing it down to a crawl. While this seemingly grants her super-fast reflexes, it takes a toll on her sanity. As their romance progresses, the two lose control of their abilities. A gulf of time and loss opens between them. Can they ever be together?
