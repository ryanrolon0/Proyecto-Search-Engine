Stop That Tank!

 This Walt Disney World War II-era training film opens with a brief humorous animated segment showing what happens to Adolf Hitler when his tanks are blown up by camouflaged infantrymen using anti-tank rifles. The rest of this film is a (mostly) live-action presentation of the characteristics and complete details of operation of the Boys MK.1 .55-calibre Anti Tank Rifle.
