The Other American

 Detroit. Fall 2008. Barack Obama makes a pre-election visit to Detroit which serves as a backdrop for a series of interviews about life and the future of the United States of America. The people are cautiously optimistic about the future in the hope that Barack Obama will bring much needed change. Opinions are diverse, but one thing is certain in their reflections and that is the situation for the country is precarious and there are no easy choices with Global Warming, Economic Collapse, War, Foreclosures, Crime, Homelessness and Unemployment, their daily companions, among others. As one person said, 'I don't agree with the international and national policies of the US government. I'm the other American.'
