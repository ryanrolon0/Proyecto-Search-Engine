Somewhere in Egypt

 It's wartime in occupied Egypt, and Sourpuss and Gandy Goose are stationed, apparently, right in front of the Sphinx. Gandy plays a soothing, exotic melody as Sourpuss drifts off to sleep, where he dreams that he and Gandy have ridden a magic carpet into the ancient Egyptian tombs. At first they seem scary, and darn Gandy can't keep his hands from fiddling with things that could be booby traps. But the adventure takes a turn for the better, as the tomb becomes filled with sexy, scantily clad kitties.
