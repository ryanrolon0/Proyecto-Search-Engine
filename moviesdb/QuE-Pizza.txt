QuE Pizza

 When Scott comes home from a long day at work (to a plethora of restaurant menus on his door), he tries a new pizza delivery service to take advantage of their promotion. After glitch in the system causes a long wait with no response from the restaurant, he finally gets his pizza - and a whole lot more.
