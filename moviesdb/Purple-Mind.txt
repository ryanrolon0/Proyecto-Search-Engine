Purple Mind

 Combat veteran Roy Matthews served three tours in Iraq. On coming home, Roy can't sleep at night and suffers the classic symptoms of PTSD. Unable to find work, Roy and his family move to an isolated cattle ranch where things get worse; flashbacks, headaches and frustration for Roy and even worse for his wife and daughter. Aware of the battle Roy is waging within, a local Sheriff and a Vietnam vet conspire to stage an intervention. Encouraged to explore his experiences as a warrior, Roy begins to open up to the feelings which have tortured him, an important step in learning to live with PTSD.
