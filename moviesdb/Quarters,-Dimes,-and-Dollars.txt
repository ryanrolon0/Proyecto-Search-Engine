Quarters, Dimes, and Dollars

 Maggie plays guitar on the streets in hopes raising money for a new guitar she sees on her way home one day. In order to get this money, she knows she must change her style of music. While playing her new music, she notices a boy, Paul, who watches her play everyday. She finally thinks she has enough money when she is twenty dollars short. The boy returns and gives her the remaining balance. Maggie buys the guitar and sees Paul waiting outside. She hands him the new guitar and she teaches him how to play.
