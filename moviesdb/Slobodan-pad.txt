 Nikola jumps out of a plane. Free fall. The last moment for re-examination. A Search for motivation, meaning of life. Five-member commission is examining Nikola. Testing the conscience and sense. A collage out of time and space. Between the sky and the ground, reality and dreams, memories and imagination. To open the parachute or to go on?
