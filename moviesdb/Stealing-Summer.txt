Stealing Summer

 Professional party clowns Jack and Jay are having difficulty earning enough money to pay their rent. While fleeing from a liquor store heist gone wrong they encounter a small town of people who are equally depraved. They soon find themselves caught up in a drug sale between a crooked cop and a local drug dealer (TLA), gaining possession of a metal briefcase. None of them are aware of just how far the others will go to get a hold of the briefcase. The explosive ending will leave them all believing that "good guys don't exist."
