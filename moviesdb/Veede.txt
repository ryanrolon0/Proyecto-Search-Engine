Veede

 Yedu is a responsible citizen of Bobbarlanka, a place where everything is in place but for the polluted water that is coming from the factory. Everybody in the village complained, but of no use. Then the village head forms a team of three comprising of Yedu, Manga and her grandmother and sends them to Hyderabad so that they could meet the minister and express the villages problem to him. Can they change things?
