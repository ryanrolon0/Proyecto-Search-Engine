U.S. Cavalry Supplies Unloading at Tampa, Florida

 "Here is a freight train of thirty cars loaded with baggage and ambulance supplies for the 9th U.S. Cavalry. In the foreground a score of troopers are pulling, lifting and hauling an ambulance from a flat car. It slides down the inclined planks with a sudden rush that makes the men 'hustle' to keep it from falling off. Drill engine on the next track darts pasts with sharp quick puffs of smoke. A very brisk scene."
