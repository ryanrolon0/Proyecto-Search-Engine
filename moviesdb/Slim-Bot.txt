Slim-Bot

 Slim-Bot is a robot on a mission to find the love of his life, Helga-Bot! Along with his companion Norma, he battles space pirates and the evil goo-men to free an entire world from a gooey maniac! In the style of old 1960's cartoon shows, and hosted by Kristy Jupiter, Leroy the Buffalo Man, and Pete Morgan the Space Octopus, Slim-Bot is exactly what the world has been waiting for for centuries!
