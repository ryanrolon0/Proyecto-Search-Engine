The Stranger at Coyote

 Bill Buckley ran things his own way at Coyote. He introduced Jim Williams, sweetheart of pretty Mabel Hoyer, to get drunk and commit some outrages not worthy of Jim in his better moments. Then a stranger came and promptly fell in love with Jessie Williams, sister of Jim. How the stranger brought order out of chaos, and what he did to the bully makes an interesting subject. Bill Buckley tried to kill the stranger and met his own end in trying to do so.
