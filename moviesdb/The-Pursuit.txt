The Pursuit

 A Christian college student named James encounters an agnostic young woman named Renee at a Christian house party and becomes infatuated with her, driving him to try and persuade her to become a Christian so she could be his girlfriend. As James seeks to encounter Renee several times after their initial meeting, James presents Renee with different Christian principles to challenge Renee's beliefs, who in return challenges James' faith with her responses, but the unexpected cost of James' pursuit causes him to give up his endeavor, and he chooses to leave Renee up to her own devices. Some time after their first encounter, they run into each other again at the same nightclub, but Renee surprises James by telling him that he inadvertently made her a believer, while James surprises Renee with the news that he is now agnostic.
