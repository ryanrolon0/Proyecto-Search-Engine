Ridin' for Justice

 Buck Randall, a happy-go-lucky cowhand on the ranch owned by Tom Wilson, is in town and heads for the Red Front Saloon where, in compliance with a town ordinance, he is ordered to give up his gun but refuses. Escaping the altercation with Marshal Joseph Slyde and his chief deputy, Alex Frame, Buck seeks shelter in the Marshal's house at the edge of town. He meets Mary Slyde, the Marshal's young, pretty, charming and unhappy wife and they are attracted to each other. While Slyde and a posse are combing the countryside for Buck, Frame is left behind to protect Mary and, the posse is barely out of sight, before Frames is forcing his unwanted attention upon her. He is shot and Mary, in shock, thinks she did it as does Buck who has returned to the house. When the Marshal and his men arrive, Buck takes the blame for Frame's death and is held for murder. Escaping from the law, Buck hides at the Marshal's house where he meets the Marshal's young wife. Leaving he hears a shot and returns to find she has killed Deputy Frame who attacked her. Marshal Slyde arrives and arrests Buck. Mary claims he is innocent but Slyde sets out to hang him anyway.
