Roof Tops of Manhattan

 While Ma and Pa O'Shea sit on their Manhattan roof top listening to the radio with their daughter Ellen, their older daughter Mary is with her beau at the Sky High Roof, a fancy nightclub. The couple arrives and sits while singers and dancers perform. Back at the O'Shea's, Ellen leaves for the picture show, but she's actually meeting Nick Lewis, a well-dressed low-life whom Mr. O'Shea dislikes. Nick takes Ellen to another club, the Riviera Roof Garden. We see performers there, as well, including comic Bob Burns. O'Shea decides on a whim to take his wife Maggie to the Riviera to celebrate their anniversary. Will they see Ellen out with Nick?
