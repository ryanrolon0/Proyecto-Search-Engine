Today's Special

 A Special TV-presentation of that Canadian children's program "Today's Special". In this presentation, Jodie, Muffy and Sam are getting ready to go to the theatre for their live performance. But because Jeff's magic hat won't work outside the store, he can't go. But does that stop him? Oh no, not this time. He decides to take a chance and hides himself in the costume box before it's loaded on the truck and sent to the theatre. When they arrive, Muffy is late. But Jodie and Sam can't keep the audience waiting, So they go on without her. Will Muffy show up?, and what about Jeff? When the box arrives at the theatre, Jeff is a mannequin and the magic won't work. Looks like Jeff's only hope is Waldo the Magnificent (Barrie Baldaro), the only one who can save him - hopefully. Today's Special was an "edu-tainment"-type program which centered around the after-hours adventures of Jeff, Jodi, Sam, and Muffy in a Toronto shopping mall. Jeff, the main character, was a mannequin during the day who came to life after the store closed. His secret was known only to Jodi, a store clerk, Sam (a puppet), the store security guard, and Muffy (also a puppet), a rhyming mouse. The show featured some strong musical segments, highlighted by performances by the Canadian Brass.
