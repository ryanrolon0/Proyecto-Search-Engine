Timber!

 The Crowley Lumber Company's wartime government contract is threatened when a series of accidents thwart production. While Arizona and Quebec try to keep the lumber camp and the lumber mill operating, their old friend Kansas arrives to help out. Kansas soon learns that a ring of saboteurs operating in the lumber company are about to throttle the nation's timber industry and the leader of the spies is operating nearby. Kansas and his friends must round up the ringleader and his traitorous henchman before serious damage is done to the Allied war effort.
