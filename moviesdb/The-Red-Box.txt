The Red Box

 A millennial adaptation of Nevil Shute's book 'On the Beach'. An account of the end of the world as seen through the eyes of a small community in Melbourne. The whole Northern hemisphere is already dead and as the population waits for the onset of radiation sickness, each character deals with their impending death in different ways. Combines actors in a blue screen studio with contemporary Australian images.
