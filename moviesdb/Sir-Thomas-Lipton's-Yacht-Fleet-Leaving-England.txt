Sir Thomas Lipton's Yacht Fleet Leaving England

 A very complete and comprehensive picture showing Sir Thomas Lipton's fleet, including Shamrock III. and I., the steam yacht "Erin" and the ocean tug "Cruzier," leaving Gourock, Scotland, at the beginning of their long ocean voyage to America. An interesting portion of this film is the scene in which genial Sir Thomas is seen bidding good-bye to his faithful officers and crew who are gathered on the after deck of the Cup challenger Shamrock III. After the farewell address, Sir Thomas leaves the yacht. As he boards the launch, which conveys him ashore, the sailors are seen giving three hearty cheers. An excellent view is then shown of the two yachts passing by in jury rig, Shamrock III. being towed by Erin and Shamrock I. by the tug "Cruzier."
