Thyella sto faro

 Lighthouse keeper Captain Bochalis, whose wife abandoned him years ago, lives in a remote lighthouse with his daughter, Chrysa. One day, a man is washed up onto the shore under the lighthouse. His name is Andreas Marelis, and had jumped off a passing ship. Father and daughter offer him hospitality, without asking too many questions, and soon Chrysa falls in love with him. But when she shows him her mother's picture, Andreas recognizes the woman he killed by mistake instead of her lover, Memas.
