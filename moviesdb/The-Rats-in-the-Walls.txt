The Rats in the Walls

 In H.P. Lovecraft's novella, a New England man returns to his ancestral home in 1920's England only to realize his family's cannibalistic history. Distraught by the revelation and driven insane by the scampering sounds of rats between the house walls, he commits an unthinkable act. Written as an epilogue to the original prose, this short focuses on the man's fear that he is being conspired against as detectives search to uncover the truth behind the murder.
