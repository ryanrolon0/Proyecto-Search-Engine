The Wedding

 By the time Tony found out that his illegal card room was $10,000 short, Kent would be long gone. He had pulled this kind of caper a hundred times. Kent didn't need a partner, but he couldn't resist sharing the experience with Kim, the diner waitress who could make his operation a whole lot easier. So why did Kent find himself holed up in a retirement home with a wounded woman, a man gunning for him and a group of senior citizens asking him to fix their AC? Would Kent let his greed do him in? Or would he find redemption?
