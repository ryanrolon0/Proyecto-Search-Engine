Prehistoric Super Salesman

 A mad scientist, named Prof. Grossenfibber, has invented a time tunnel. Woody Woodpecker, a knick-knack salesman, initially pesters the scientist, who kicks him out. But when the Prof. needs a test subject, he quickly invites Woody back, and promptly sends him to the stone age with the machine. While there, Woody manages to peddle some of his objects to a dinosaur and a caveman, but will he ever get back?
