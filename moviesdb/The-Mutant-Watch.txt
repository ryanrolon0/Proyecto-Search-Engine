The Mutant Watch

 At a US Senate Congressional committee meeting, Senator Kelly addresses the panel about what he sees as "menace" of mutants, people who are born with genetic encoded superpowers, especially that secret militia known as The X-Men. Interspersed with Senator Kelly's presentation are documentary pieces about the creation of the comic book characters and the creation of the major feature film.
