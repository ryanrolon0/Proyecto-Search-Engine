Snuff Film

 Snuff Film is a film like no other; this is a simulated adventure into the perverted, sick and twisted mind of a true psychopath who has decided to record his wild journeys into depravity on his only friend, his video camera. Through the eyes of the camera we get to see a glimpse of how far this tormented individual will go to get himself off, but can even this twisted sicko go too far?
