Throw It Down

 "Throw It Down," a documentary that provides an intimate look into life on the road and other aspects of a Division I drum and bugle corps. Three years in the making, this movie is about the 2006 Bluecoats' Connexus season; however, it doesn't serve as a mere chronicle of the events which took place during that year, rather, it captures the essence of all drum corps by focusing on specific experiences, hopes, dreams and stories of a single corps at a single moment in its history.
