Poor Old Fido!

 Tommy ties Fido to his grandfather's rocking chair and puts Fido on a chair. Tommy's mother puts Fido's dinner on the floor just out of his reach. Fido jumps for it, pulls grandfather over with a crash, and then gets a cuffing for Tommy's mischief. This is an unusually good comedy, fully as good as "TOMMY'S RINGING GOOD JOKE."
