True Crime

 Nick Kang was an LAPD homicide detective, up until his indefinite suspension due to his "loose-cannon" style and multiple uses of excessive force and property damage. However, his old Chief has brought him back and offered him a job with the EOD (Elite Operations Division), a recently-founded special unit which has jurisdiction over all of Los Angeles. Now as the EOD's first field agent, Nick can use the same over-the-top methods that got him suspended in the first place to take on the City of Angels' toughest criminals. In a wide, branching storyline, he'll have to stop powerful Russian and Chinese crime syndicates by driving, fighting and shooting his way through the streets of LA.
