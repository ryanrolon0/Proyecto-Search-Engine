W. Gibson - Excentricite amEricaine

 A picture too funny for description. Gibson, the noted American actor, appears upon the scene and goes through his funny acts, changing his costumes with the rapidity of lightning. He finally ends the scene by seating himself upon an oilstove, which causes great volumes of smoke to pour out from beneath his coat tails. It ends in a terrific explosion, but Gibson comes down whole.
