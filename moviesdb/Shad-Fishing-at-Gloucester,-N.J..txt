Shad Fishing at Gloucester, N.J.

 This picture is one that is truly interesting and portrays the shad fishing industry below Gloucester City, N.J., on the Delaware. To many who have never seen how shad are caught it will prove an excellent attraction. The men are seen to cast the net and finally haul it in and unload it. If you want a star picture, buy this one. It is needless to say that the photography in this picture is distinct in every particular, which is characteristic of all our work.
