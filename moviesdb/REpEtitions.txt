REpEtitions

 For six months Marie AndrE followed the rehearsals in Brussels of "Elena's Aria", a dance show choreographed by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, the manager of the Rosas company and performed by five female dancers. All their gestures, whether artistic or ordinary, are closely observed by Marie AndrE's respectful camera. Work in progress is celebrated here rather the final result, the show itself.
