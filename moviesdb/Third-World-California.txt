Third World California

 THIRD WORLD CALIFORNIA dramatically portrays the current hopelessness of the people of the lower Coachella Valley through their own words, and presents a few possible courses of action towards a solution to the problem. It unfolds the legal and political conflicts between the city county and trailer park owners. It explores the health problems related to poor living conditions through interviews with local doctors. It takes the viewers on a journey of the work of the social workers that found and lead community groups to help dignify these underprivileged lives by helping bring the trailers to more livable and healthier conditions.
