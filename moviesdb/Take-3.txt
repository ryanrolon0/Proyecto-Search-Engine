Take 3

 TAKE 3 is a 13 episode series that promotes the awareness of original, multi-ethnic and multicultural, feature-length films, and film shorts, that have been written, directed, or produced, primarily by independent filmmakers of color, women filmmakers and filmmakers in general that feature ethnically-diverse casting and well known popular actors. Most of the films featured in TAKE 3 have yet to receive theatrical release so a number of them have gone straight to DVD. Each half hour episode profiles four films/filmmakers from around the country, and around the world, and gives the audience an in-depth look into these dynamic films through film clips and interviews. Visually exciting and entertaining, each episode presents diverse independent films that feature high-profile and known actors like MISSING IN AMERICA with Danny Glover, Linda Hamilton, Ron Perlman and David Strathairn; RESTRAINING ORDER with Robin Givens and Sean Blakemore, PNOK with Danny Glover, Elle Fanning and Robert Ri'chard; and the film Royal Kill with Eric Roberts (brother of Julia), and the late Pat Morita, just to name a few. TAKE 3 offers independent filmmakers a much needed opportunity to increase their films' name recognition, build audience awareness, and confirm the idea that quality, ethnically diverse independent films can be well written, exciting, entertaining and just as competitive in the entertainment marketplace. This series will also enable independent films to receive greater exposure by reaching both the urban marketplace and mass audiences alike.
