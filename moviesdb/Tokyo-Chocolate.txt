Tokyo Chocolate

 A young American woman named Jade, visits her grandfather's chocolate shop in "Little Tokyo," Dusseldorf, Germany. Unbeknownst to her, she has walked right into the middle of an international Japanese crime syndicate. She is quickly swept up into a whirlwind adventure. The stakes are raised, when Jade's grandfather is kidnapped and taken to Berlin by the Samurai Foxes, a group of deadly female assassins. Ironically, the only person available to help Jade, is not a martial arts expert, but a surfer dude from Los Angeles named Cali. They have no choice but to travel to Berlin in the company van, which is shaped like a giant chocolate bar. Once there, Jade and Cali find themselves in the midst of four rival gangs; the Russian mafia, a notorious German street gang, the Yakuza crime syndicate and the Samurai Foxes. All of the gangs are after the same thing... the "Claw of the Dragon." With the time clock ticking, they must unravel the mystery surrounding the "Claw of the Dragon" and find Jade's grandfather before it is too late.
