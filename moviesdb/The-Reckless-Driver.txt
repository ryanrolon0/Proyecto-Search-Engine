The Reckless Driver

 Driving down a U.S. highway, Woody passes a billboard which reminds him that he should renew his drivers' license. He heads to the department of motor vehicles and asks Officer Wally Walrus, who takes an immediate dislike to Woody, to give him the test. He puts Woody through the eye test, the reflex test, and the fingerprint test...with Woody constantly making short work of the walrus' patience. Finally, he puts him through the driving test with the bird converting his car into a rocket zooming around the office driving Wally berserk. At this point, Woody exclaims, "Say. I've changed my mind. I want a pilot's license!"
