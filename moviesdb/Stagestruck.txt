 Sally lives in a small 'no-name' town. Today is her 12th birthday. Sally is getting no attention. Half a dozen children tear the place apart. Whoosh!- a green Mustang screeches to a halt in front of the doorway. Sally's eccentric aunt, Isabella, springs out. She brings Sally an unusual gift videotape of a famous musical with her favorite star. To a family like Sally's whose culture runs the gamut from bingo nights to 'Nightmare on Elm Street', this gift is incomprehensible, but to Sally it will become the seed of a life-long dream.
