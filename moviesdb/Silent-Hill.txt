Silent Hill

 The resort town of Silent Hill slips into quiet desolation, now that the peak of development and growth has passed by. But bitter-sweet memories of joyous times with friends and lovers beckons the desperate, the weak, the lost, and the repentant to revisit Silent Hill. But for these visitors, the town becomes a gateway to a parallel world of confusion and torment where the horrors of their sins and the demons of their repressed guilt come to life. Silent Hill, for some, is a last chance for atonement and a new life; for others, it becomes a never-ending Hell on Earth, where they remain trapped, forever.
