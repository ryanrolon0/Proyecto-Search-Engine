Time for Love

 The courtship of two swans is interrupted by a third swan, who demonstrates his prowess at catching fish. The pen falls for him and leaves her mate, but when the interloper begins treating her cruelly and chases her around the pond, her old flame intercedes and chases the evil swan away.
