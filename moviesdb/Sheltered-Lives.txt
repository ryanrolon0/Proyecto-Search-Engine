Sheltered Lives

 The Bethnal Green Tube shelter disaster took place on the evening of Wednesday March 3rd, 1943. 173 people died in a terrifying crush as panic spread through the crowds of people trying to enter the station's bomb shelter in the east end of London. However, no bomb struck and not a single casualty was the direct result of military aggression, making it the deadliest civilian incident of World War Two. In Sheltered Lives, three survivors recount their memories of that terrible night.
