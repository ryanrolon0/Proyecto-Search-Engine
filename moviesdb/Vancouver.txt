Vancouver

 Filmmaker 'Clancy Dennehy' (qv) explores the history of the City of Vancouver, British Columbia through the photographs of Fred Herzog. From these historic roots, he takes us to what Vancouver has now become, including its built form, its people, and its energy through man made and natural movement. These visuals provide what one may feel while being in the city.
