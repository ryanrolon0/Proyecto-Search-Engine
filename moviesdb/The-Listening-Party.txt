The Listening Party

 The script follows Doyle Bucklin, a musician facing his own creative mortality and, like many artists, as inspiration skips out, liquor and drugs move in. Around the same time, Doyle achieves some commercial success, and a major record label releases his new album. His manager (Blair) has crafted a burgeoning career in the wake of Doyle's success, even managing to spin Doyle's self-destruction into a buzz worthy public image.
