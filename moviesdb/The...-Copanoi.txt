The... Copanoi

 Leonidas is tricked into thinking he will hit the jackpot by a guy from the underworld, Babis, also well-known on the street as "the teacher". So, he sets up an ad hoc gang with his close friends in order to rob a bank. The operation, however, is crowned by complete failure. Actually, Babis used Leonidas to create a diversion in order to rob a jeweler's shop. Leonidas flies into a rage and swears to take revenge on the "teacher". The scuffle that follows results in all of them ending up in hospital.
