To a Man with a Big Nose

 The film is a visual adaptation of a poem by Spanish author Quevedo. A frustrated little man is unable to get rid of his disproportionally big nose, which comes to life and decides to go on a strange journey, dragging the poor little man along. Through this surreal trip the man -and his nose- will experiment a series of transformations and change of environments from a swordfish in the depths of the sea to a monumental Sphynx in the Egyptian desert.
