Swing It, Sailor!

 Husky Stone (Ray Mayer), strongest man in the Navy, and as short on brains as he is as long on muscle, has an urge to get married, as his enlistment is up. The object of his affection is Myrtle Montrose (Isabal Jewell), a typical "Sweetheart of the Navy." Seeking to discourage Husky's plans is his pal, Pete Kelly (Wallace Ford), who uses Husky to fight his battles and do his work. Pete frames Husky and he is confined to the brig, as their ship docks in San Francisco. Pete goes ashore, courts the fickle and ever-ready Myrtle and makes her forget Husky. The latter, when he finds out, knocks Pete out cold and refuses to have anything to do with him. Pete and Husky are sent on a working party during aerial bombing practice. They board a floating target to repair it and, unknown to the others, Husky is knocked out by a loose timber. Heading back to the ship, Pete discovers that Husky is missing, jumps overboard from the launch and swims back to the target to rescue Husky.
