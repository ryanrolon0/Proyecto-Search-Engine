United We Fall

 United We Fall is a documentary about the North American Union that is being developed right now between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. This film takes a look at both sides by interviewing both insiders and activists who have been at the heart of this heated debate. Starting with the Free Trade agreements of the post-war era and moving on to the globalized world we now live in, the film looks to the broader agenda of building a global government and its implications.
