Strife of Tongues

 Exploring the struggles that exist between science and religion, mind and heart, machines and nature, Man and God, "Strife of Tongues" creates a unique experience from images of post-war industrial films coupled with dense soundscapes. The avant-garde narrative describes the creation of the world, the formation of boundaries as a result of restlessness and a species so bent on its own destruction that it will go to any length to accomplish its foolhardy goal.
