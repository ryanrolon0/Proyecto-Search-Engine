The Horrible Nightmare

 Another Welsh rarebit victim, who, after a night at the club, is making mad endeavors to retire for the rest of the night. He crawls into bed, when like a flash of lightning, the bed turns upside down and the rarebit victim finds himself underneath. In a fit of anger, he seizes the bedclothes and endeavors to adjust them, when suddenly the bed flies back to its proper condition. Just as he steps into bed a second time, a terrific explosion takes place and the bed flies into a thousand pieces, leaving the room demolished and our friend in a confused state of mind, but he suddenly awakens and finds it is only a dream.
