The Dollmaker

 It is the dawn of the 20th century and Emily and Kristina are struggling to come to terms with the death of their mother. Soon they are visited by a mysterious traveler who promises to create a doll that will help them commune with the dead. However, this 'Dollmaker' neglects to tell them that with every gift must come an equal or greater sacrifice.
