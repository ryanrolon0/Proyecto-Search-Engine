The Extensive Wardrobe

 A man is seen to enter a room and take off his coat, hang it on the wall when another coat immediately appears on his person. He repeats this until about 15 or 20 pegs are each covered with a coat which he had taken off. From the actions one would think he was bereft of his reason, and it is not to be wondered at when one views this picture and observes how coats and vests appear to grow on this man. As fast as he takes one off another appears on him. This is an illusion that will be enjoyed by everybody.
