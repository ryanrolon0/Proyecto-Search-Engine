Triple Negative Breast Cancer

 Discovery Channel presents an all new patient education program that addresses triple-negative breast cancer, including risk factors, treatment, and promising research being done on targeted therapy for the disease. Triple-negative breast cancer can affect any woman, but the risk is different among different groups and occurs more in certain populations, including African-American women. Triple-negative breast cancer can be treated, but it is aggressive and presents special challenges and risks. Throughout the hour, a group of women will share personal stories about their diagnosis, treatment decisions they faced and ways they are coping with the disease.
