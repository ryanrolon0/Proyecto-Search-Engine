Spooking About Africa

 Casper is in an African jungle. He frightens a zebra at a watering hole. Wheezy the elephant has a terrible sneezing problem; he sneezes all the feathers off a peacock and a group of monkeys out of their perches. Casper decides to help, and in the process dislodges the feather that was making the elephant sneeze. But then a fire breaks out, and the elephant is unable to sneeze on command.
