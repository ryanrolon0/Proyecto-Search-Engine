The Term

 A crumpled up piece of brown paper is blowing down a secluded highway by the wind. A car comes by running over the piece of paper and flattening it. But unlike animals, the paper comes back to life, rolling further with the wind. Although an animal would have been killed by being run over, the piece of paper almost has human-like qualities in its movement.
