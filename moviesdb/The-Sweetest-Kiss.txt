The Sweetest Kiss

 A man receives the news of his death from a ghostly messenger. Unable to tell his fate to another, his final act of life speaks for itself... Based on Newfoundland folklore and recounted by innumerable 'believers' in the phenomena, this film offers a cultural link to the disappearing past. The film was shot on 16mm Vision3 500T with the assistance of the Newfoundland Independent Filmmakers Cooperative.The film innovates on colour correction methods to identify different time periods and uses a palette of unique natural Newfoundland colours.
