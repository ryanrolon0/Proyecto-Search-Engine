The New Saint

 Yevgeny Rodionov was an ordinary young Russian soldier who fell in Chechnya after being taken prisoner and refusing to convert to Islam. He was proclaimed a martyr and became an unofficial saint for many Russians. The life of Yevgeny's mother Lyubov underwent a radical change when her child 'became' a saint. Unable to let go of her grief, she keeps his iconic memory alive with the support of Orthodox priests, biker gangs and the Russian army, which uses his legend on TV shows, young cadets are preparing to sacrifice themselves and follow in their hero's footsteps.
