Seneca Falls

 Nine diverse high school girls (and one ten-year-old boy) set out from San Francisco to Seneca Falls, New York to stage their original play at a huge celebration of the birth of women's rights in America. Part teenage road trip, part stunning history lesson, the film grows tense and dramatic as the young women discover the power of their own voices, and form bonds across lines of race and class. Ultimately, when they step out on stage, they carry the torch of women's rights as human rights and awaken to their place in the world.
