The Claim Jumper

 Mack and Ella are engaged to be married, but Mack's father will not give his consent. Mack is further disheartened because Ella will not marry him without his father's permission. On the government-grant land, Mr. Whitcomb, Mack's father, discovers oil. As Mr. Whitcomb has filed a previous find, he cannot file this one, and offers his son one-half of the claim, if he will file it for him. During Mr. Whitcomb's conversation with his son, he is overheard by what is commonly termed claim jumpers. The proposition is accepted by his son, who rides away. En route, he passes the home of his sweetheart, and he informs her of his mission. Following him are the two claim jumpers, who heard Mr. Whitcomb's conversation. These men arouse the suspicion of Ella, who quickly follows them. Mack locates the claim by the number on the map, and is busily engaged staking it out, when the claim jumpers land upon him. One of them takes the map from him, and rides to the Recorder's office, while the other fights with Mack. However Ella, has a surprise in store for them.
