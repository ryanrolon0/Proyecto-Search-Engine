The Score

 Dr. Magnusson is a brilliant geneticist racing to isolate a cancer-causing gene. All that's standing in her way is competition from a well funded French lab, pressure from a multinational pharmaceutical company, her ticking biological clock, a risky office romance, and the fear that she might carry the same Huntington's gene that prematurely ended her mother's life. Based on the award winning play by Electric Company Theatre, THE SCORE explores human elements and revolutionary implications of the rapidly advancing world of genetics and uses humour, music and dance to transform scientific ideas into universal themes of identity, freedom and creation.
