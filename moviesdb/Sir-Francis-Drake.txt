Sir Francis Drake

 At the defining moment of his military career, Sir Francis Drake risks everything to engage his nemesis in a battle of honour. It's 1596. Spain declares war against England. Sir Francis Drake and his navigator and best friend, Giovanni Battista Boazio, are called upon to protect the Queen's shores and lead her Navy to victory. Before the battle begins, Sir Drake encounters his old nemesis, Vice Admiral Lord Howard of Effingham. The men are quickly embroiled in a surprising yet fiery showdown, the force of which not even an attacking Spanish Armada can extinguish. 'First we finish the game, then we finish the invincible Armanda.' --Sir Francis Drake
