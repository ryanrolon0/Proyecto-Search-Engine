Roots & Wings

 Ruben Diaz, a sensitive man very skilled at carpentry, has emigrated with his family to the United States from Mexico. He is generally happy, but shows some irritation that his oldest son, Pedro, now favors the use of English over Spanish, and basketball in place of soccer (one of his passions). Ruben is a good and warm man dedicated to his family and his Catholic faith, so when his wife Maria and daughter Elena choose to be baptized into the Mormon Church, he feels betrayed, that his life is slipping out of his control and that cultural traditions giving him comfort will be lost.
