Swety

 Three friends come to unknown cottage to relax for a few days and have a bit of fun. But their arrival already indicates that there is something wrong. This place is obviously not as they imagine, causing the first degree of conflict. This all can not be even compared with what is waiting for them ... in the world there are many hidden mystical places, small selves' worlds, which we will never understand.
