The Kentucky Derby

 There is dirty work afoot in old Kentucky when a rival decides his horse will have a better chance of winning if the son of the owner isn't around, so he has him shanghaied onto a tramp freighter and gets the jockey in his debt through a crooked gambling game. Airplanes, ship-wrecks, sea storms, kidnapping, frame-up and much skull-duggery prior to the race.
