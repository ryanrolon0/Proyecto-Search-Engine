Scarred

 Local legend has it that a woman roams the woods in search of a pretty face to replace the vacant hole where her own was brutally torn off. Tonight, a family has set-up camp in these same woods, and they are about to discover the story of the faceless killer is no mere campfire tale... Can they escape the violent ripping power of one's face?
