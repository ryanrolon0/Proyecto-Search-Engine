The Itch

 A London man with an overbearing wife, who does nothing all day but watch television, develops an itch on his back. Incredibly, it turns out he is sprouting wings. He gives them a try one night, and they work. He can fly. He clashes with authorities, though, when he can't produce a flying license. Meanwhile, his wife is none too happy over the situation.
