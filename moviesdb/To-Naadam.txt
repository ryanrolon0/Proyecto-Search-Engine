To Naadam

 This documentary presents an intimate portrait of life on the steppes of Mongolia and the dramatic changes these people have undergone through the previous seventy years of Communism. The lens of the camera plunges into a semi-nomadic Mongolian herding community focusing on their traditional lifestyle. The headmaster of the family is a respected stallion trainer and herdsman; with other trainers, they train the horses, teach the children ages from 5-12 and prepare them for the annual Naadam festival in the horse-racing competition section.
