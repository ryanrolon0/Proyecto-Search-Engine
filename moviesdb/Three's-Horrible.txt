Three's Horrible

 "Three's Horrible" is a satirical treatment of the great horror movie monsters of the 30s, 40s and 50s. Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolf-Man all live together in a dirty, old, ranch-style apartment house waiting for the next time they're wanted again. Personalities are introduced and ultimately clash in this first part of a new series.
