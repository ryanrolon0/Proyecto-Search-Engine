 Aleka, a sixteen-year-old girl on holiday, still plays childish games with boys - that's why she is also called a tomboy. The children always play outside the window of - and constantly annoy - a university student, Dimitris, who is on the island to study in peace for his upcoming exams. He is always having words with Aleka. They don't get along at all, until, at some point, Aleka begins to see Dimitris differently, as love begins to make a nest in her innocent teenage heart, and it's not long before she is completely besotted. It is the ingenuous first love, full of innocence, beauty and tenderness, youth and insouciance.
