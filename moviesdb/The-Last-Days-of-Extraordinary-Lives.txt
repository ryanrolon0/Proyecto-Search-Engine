The Last Days of Extraordinary Lives

 If end-of-life looks you in the face, what thoughts, feelings, words and wisdom would you tell about living life...to the fullest. In this inspiring documentary, ordinary people (just like you and me) face their last days and tell extraordinary stories about life and living. Thirteen people, ages 2 to 94, including an aids victim, a mother of two with cancer, and an Amish family share touching stories filled with love, hope, joy, wisdom, and laughter...repeat, laughter! Ironically, even though their days are limited, they show us how to live life to the fullest and to teach us many life lessons that will not be forgotten.
