The Renegade Ranger

 Texas Ranger Jack Steele is assigned to bring in former ranch owner Judith Alvarez, now the leader of a gang who is waging war against the crooked government officials who cheated the ranchers out of their land. The Rangers send Jack Steel to bring in wanted murderer Judith Alvarez. He is on hand when Sanderson's men attack and he saves her life. This gets him into her gang where he gradually realizes she is innocent and Sanderson is the one he is after. But ex-Ranger Larry is now one of her men and he reveals Jack's true identity. Jack is then slated to shortly have a fatal accident.
