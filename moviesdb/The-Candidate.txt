The Candidate

 In 1996 Kevin Antoine became the first African American to win a major political party's nomination in Mississippi's majority-White Fourth Congressional District, upsetting the Mississippi political establishment. The film follows the strategic campaign of this political novice's unexpected win of the Democratic nomination while running against 11-year white female Jackson city council member who was the favorite to win the nomination.
