T for Terrorist

 T for Terrorist, a new and timely short film that explores one possible - and darkly comedic - ramification of typecasting Arab actors in Hollywood. The story begins with meek character actor Sayed, once again playing the "bad guy." This time in T for Terrorist, a studio production ruled over by a dictatorial young Director. Pushed past his limit for abuse and encouraged by a mysterious Man in White. Sayed takes over the set and forces the Director to play the terrorist while he himself finally gets to play the hero.. but will Hollywood let him get away with it?
