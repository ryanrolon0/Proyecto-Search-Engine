Survival to Service

 Benjamin Wollor is one of the lucky young men who nearly survived Liberia's brutal, fourteen-year civil war. He left home shortly after the war to find an education in Monrovia. Six years later he reunites with his mother as he proudly becomes the President of his high school. His mother, speaking to the school, states that she can die now knowing her son has become somebody important against every conceivable odd.
