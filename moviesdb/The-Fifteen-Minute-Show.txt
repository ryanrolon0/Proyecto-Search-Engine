The Fifteen Minute Show

 Jack Tyler and Brian Goad are just a couple of students with another idea for a campus TV show, so nobody expects much when the first episode of The Fifteen Minute Show airs. But when the show becomes a runaway hit, everyone wants a piece of the action. While fighting off the advances of the beautiful Mystery Dream Girl, avoiding the wrath of the bitter station manager, and breaking in a new key grip, Jack and Brian plan an episode that will either be their ultimate triumph, or their greatest downfall. A film that not only mocks, but also embraces the crappy production quality of college television, the producers guarantee that you'll love this movie*. Through the trials of Jack and Brian, you'll learn compassion**, understanding*** and above all else, that peeing on pants on television is "strictly prohibited." * Guarantee good only in Great Britain circa 1860 ** Intolerance *** How to turn off your DVD player
