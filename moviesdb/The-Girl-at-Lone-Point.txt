The Girl at Lone Point

 Helen catches two yeggmen who have broken into a freight car which has been detached from a train because of a hot box and are attempting to rifle the safe. The yeggmen escape aboard a passing freight with Helen, who has leaped upon the caboose, in hot pursuit, along with the trainmen. At one point, Helen drops down one of the side ladders, turns the angle cocks in the airline and gives the cutting lever a yank, splitting the train in two. The yeggmen are captured leaving Helen to await her next hazard the following week.
