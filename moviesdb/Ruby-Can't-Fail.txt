Ruby Can't Fail

 Finding a new life...in your old hometown. After 10 years in Hollywood struggling to make it as an actress and realizing that most of her roles have consisted of playing dead bodies on crime shows....Ruby Keebler admits she has pretty much failed. She is deep into her 30's, with no job, no husband, no kids, and no prospects. Now what? Ready for a change but with few options, she returns home to the small lakeside town where she grew up.
