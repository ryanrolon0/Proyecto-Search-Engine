Rap War One

 Dequan, just like any other kid who grows up in the jungle of Brooklyn, has a dream escaping. A dream to not end up like so many others around him who are destined for jail or the cemetery before they make it out of their teens. He tries to follow the right path but after losing his dead-end job and discovering that his live-in girlfriend is pregnant, he decides that he has to cook up a plan to get money. Lots of money. His best friend Brandon introduces him to a secret club in Brooklyn christened The Pit. Run by a local gangster named G-Mega, The Pit is an underground warehouse where unsigned street rappers from all across New York City battle on stage for fame, money and sex. Once Dequan enters The Pit he finds himself caught in a world of corruption, drugs and death that he can't escape.
