St. Vincent

 Hitman Vincent Novena goes deep undercover portraying a priest to get close enough to kill his gangland traitor target. He soon discovers that playing the part of a good man is more dangerous than being a mob killer ever was. No good deed goes unpunished. The more Vincent opens up, the more vulnerable he becomes. Yet he never completely loses his cutting edge. A taut and explosive crime drama fueled by irony and laced with wry humor.
