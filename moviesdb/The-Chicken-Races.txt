The Chicken Races

 Welcome to the worst day of Jake's life. This is Freshman Clash Day, the day when Jake must restore honor to his family name by winning the title of Chicken King, a title stolen from his brother Evan last year. To win the title of Chicken King, Jake must win the Chicken Races. And to win the Chicken Races, Jake must realize they are not a race, but a state of mind.
