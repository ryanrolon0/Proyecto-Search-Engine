Solo y su ladero

 Dan roams along a big desert. One day another man and a boy comes form the other side of the horizon in a motorbike asking for water. The man promises to come back to take him away if he gets more water for him. The boy refuses to get back on the bike so the man abandons him leaving him with Dan, waiting for the man in the bike to come back.
