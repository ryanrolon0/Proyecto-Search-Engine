Two Loves

 "When you start a sentence with 'homosexuality' as a Mormon, you have to end that sentence with 'is a sin.'" In Two Loves, a twenty-five minute documentary, five individuals offer personal accounts of how they or someone close to them has attempted to reconcile being gay and Mormon with such definitely absolute statements. The cross-section spans a broad array-from an openly gay, born-and-raised Mormon who has now left the Church to a celibate, practicing Mormon to a gay teenager currently in the throes of decision-making. Some chose to leave the Church, others decide to stay; some chose to openly embrace their sexuality, others do not. For at least a brief moment, however, they are all faced with the same dilemma and forced to make difficult, often alienating choices. By confronting the disconnect between predominant beliefs among their religious community and their own personal beliefs, desires and experiences, these individuals are pioneers-navigating new terrain and confronting challenging questions. A person's religion and sexual orientation are both a large part of who they are. So what is someone supposed to do when these two things conflict?
