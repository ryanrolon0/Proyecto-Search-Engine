The Usurer

 A wealthy moneylender instructs his collectors to foreclose on the property of every debtor who is behind on his or her payments. Many families are affected by this decision, in some cases with tragic results. But the moneylender is unconcerned, and he ignores their pleas while he enjoys showing off his wealth. But when he is accidentally locked inside his office's valuables vault one evening, he realizes to his horror that suddenly all his wealth is useless to save him.
