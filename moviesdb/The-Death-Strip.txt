The Death Strip

 In 1980, Mike (11) is the only survivor when his family attempt an escape from East Berlin over the Death Strip. Ten years later, he reluctantly returns to the united Germany to confront his past and the truth behind his mother's disappearance in the STASI machinery (former Ministry for State Security).
