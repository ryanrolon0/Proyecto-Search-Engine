Survivin' the Island

 A camera crew follows a contestant after her appearance ends on the television show "Survivor." Back stateside, Jenna Lewis is having a hard time adjusting to life in a Los Angeles office. She sleeps outdoors, eats rats for lunch, and behaves in other ways distinct from those of her urban colleagues. She's gone native, an island girl adrift in the city. Is there a place for her? What about Ginger and Mary Ann?
