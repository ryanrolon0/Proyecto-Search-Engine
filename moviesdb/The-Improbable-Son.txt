The Improbable Son

 "The Improbable Son" is a lovable clown who takes his inheritance and ventures off on the journey of a lifetime, leaving family and friends in search of 'true happiness'. Set in the heart of the Derbyshire Dales, he visits many of the local attractions, even stepping back in time to meet some extraordinary characters of a by-gone age. He makes a lot of 'fly-by-night' friends along the way, in particular a lady-friend with whom he intends to spend the rest of his life. A tale where reality and dreams collide!
