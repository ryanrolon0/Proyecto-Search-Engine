Saving Egyptian Film Classics

 "Saving Egyptian Film Classics" deals with the harsh consequences of neglecting films in the storage rooms without preservation. Egypt produces the most popular cinema in the Middle East and, after Hollywood and India, produces more movies than any other country in the world. The Egyptian Filmmakers have produced masterpieces since 1920s. Now all these films are in great danger. Egypt has no film preservation facilities to preserve these great movies.
