Running Pains

 Rhys is a high school track star. He's the pride of his school and the envy of his team-mates. He's been running since he was knee high, under the strict guidance of his over-bearing father and his highly-strung coach. His whole running career has been heading towards one event Final! However, as the Inter-School Final approaches Rhys finds himself drawn from his arduous training routine to the fun-loving freedom his friends enjoy. Things get even more complicated with the arrival of Corrado and Pop Corridore Sopranos'. They are bent on winning the Inter-School Final by any means necessary... 'Running Pains' is a coming-of-age comedy that asks how one boy can please a whole school if he can't even please himself.
