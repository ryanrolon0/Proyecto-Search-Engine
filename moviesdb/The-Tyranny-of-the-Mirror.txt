The Tyranny of the Mirror

 The mirror image is a hard master. Most women know what it's like to find their reflection wanting. There's always something not quite right--not tall enough, short enough, curvy enough, thin enough, old enough, young enough. It's always easy to focus on your own faults. This cinepoem (cinematic poem) features 8 different vignettes, 8 different voices and 8 different faces in the mirror.
