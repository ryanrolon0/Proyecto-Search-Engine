Queen Victoria's Funeral [Number 1]

 Scene at Trinity Pier, showing the coffin arriving on gun-carriage, which is stopped at the landing stage. The pall with the crown and sceptre being taken off, the coffin is carried through to the boat. King Edward VII and Emperor William, with the ladies of the court in deep mourning, walk behind the gun carriage. A very fine picture is afforded of the entire party.
