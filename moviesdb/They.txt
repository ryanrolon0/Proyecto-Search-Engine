They

 They is a film concerning a municipal area in North Liverpool, which has suffered an extreme drop in population. The area is one of the lowest socio-economic areas in England, which used to be an active, highly populated community but has mostly been demolished and replaced by an unused hilly park which extends over much of the district. The surrounding neighborhoods are fighting for the solidarity of their remaining communities and at the same time they are in search of a new identity and better conditions. They precisely addresses this issue, whilst also developing its own narration which leads to a more abstract and trans-formative approach to how the landscape of this place may be viewed.
