Roses

 Jang-mi, a Korean-American woman, finds herself out of love with her husband and in love with his younger employee, Juan. Rosario, a Latina teenager and virtual mother to her family, defies her father to meet up with Gabriel, the boy she has pined for a year while he served time in prison. Over the course of a single day, Rosario and Jang-mi take giant leaps to escape the lives that have them feeling suffocated, criss-crossing paths without noticing one another. When their lovers both reject them, both women must decide whether to return to their confining lives or to move in their own direction. Can a stranger's understanding make us realize we are not entirely alone?
