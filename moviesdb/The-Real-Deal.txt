The Real Deal

 Just days away from graduation a group of seniors at Arrupe High School join the world in experiencing a major media takeover by a group calling themselves "The Real Deal." The takeover lasts an hour and during that time The Real Deal broadcasts images and facts via every media outlet available, including cell phones, television, radio, and computers. These facts, disturbing but true, challenge people to act. Some of the students are unphased by the media jolt, others are more deeply affected by The Real Deal and begin a journey towards self discovery and growth leading up to and following their commencement into the real world.
