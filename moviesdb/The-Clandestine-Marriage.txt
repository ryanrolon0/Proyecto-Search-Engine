The Clandestine Marriage

 A period film, set around an English country house whose owners want to arrange a marriage of convenience between their elder daughter and an aristocratic heir of a hard-up noble family. The planned marriage suffers a last-minute upset when the would-be husband switches affections to the bride's sister. Mr. Sterling, a wealthy upstart without breading or good taste, and his sister Mrs. Heidelberg, the widow of a rich Dutchman, have spared coasts nor effort to set a worthy stage, complete with fashionable gardens and elaborate water feature, and stage a lavish show in their country estate for the celebration of his daughter's arranged wedding to Sir John, the son and heir of Lord Ogleby whose nobly titled estate would bankrupt without a hefty dowry. The whole plan comes crumbling down -as, incidentally, some of the paraphernalia- when a few Cupid darts and quick recalculations lead to suggestions for alternative matches, even at rebate prices, while none of the people of rank realize his daughter is already secretly married for love -in Fleet debtors prison- to his clerk Richard Lovewell.
