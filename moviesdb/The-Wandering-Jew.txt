The Wandering Jew

 A German-Jewish artist encounters German anti-semitism when his masterpiece is rejected by the Berlin Academy of Art. Later, the figure in the painting comes to life and tells him the history of the Jews' persecution. This unusual film ends with footage of an anti-Hitler rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden.
