True Asian Horror

 A new wave of Asian horror movie filmmakers is capturing the attention of film studios desperate for box office success. From Tokyo to Hong Kong and Bangkok to Seoul, this two-part documentary describes how Asian directors have successfully married the power of local myths and superstitions with cutting-edge filming techniques and innovative storytelling, producing some of the scariest moments in the history of cinema. True Asian Horror includes scenes from The Ring - the movie voted by cinemagoers around the world as the scariest movie ever - and modern horror classics such as The Eye and Phone. Sit back as the directors of these classic films reveal how they manage to frighten the life out of their audiences and hear film critics explain why Hollywood is terrified to turn its back on Asian moviemakers whose meteoric rise to the top has been just plain scary.
