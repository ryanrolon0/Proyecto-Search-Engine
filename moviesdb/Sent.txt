 A worker in the shipping department starts to hallucinate and become violent as he slips further away from reality. This change into a deranged worker happens quickly due to a increase in popularity of stand-up comedian Cheeks Easton; a used-to-be co-worker of our main character who is now a constant topic for conversation at his workplace. The main character alienates himself from the rest of the workers and slowly slips into a dream world where he might indefinitely be trapped.
