Riders of the North

 In a trapper's cabin, Sergeant Stone finds a fellow Mountie murdered and is given the assignment of locating the killer. He finds Tom who was at the cabin and his fingerprints match those on the gun. But Stone thinks Tom was framed and one of the two other men present is guilty. So he gets the Inspector to employ an old trick he thinks will get a confession from them. Trading-post owner, Tim McGuire, is the leader of a gang of cutthroat bandits who steal the pelts from fur-trappers, and turn them over to McGuire. Constable Jones, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, trails them to a hideout and is murdered by Leclerc but frames Buddy, who was knocked out in a fight before the killing, for the crime. RCMP Sergeant Stone is sent to investigate the crime. He also has another Mountie, posing as a wanted-fugitive, who joins the gang.
