Ted Leo & the Pharmacists

 Dirty Old Town is a day in the life of Ted Leo, with the Pharmacists, as he descends on Coney Island, NY to play at the 3rd Annual Siren Music Festival. Director Justin Mitchell (Songs for Cassavetes, Drive Well, Sleep Carefully) takes a deeper look at the man behind the praised albums Tyranny of Distance and Hearts of Oak (Lookout! Records). Ted Leo mixes his punk politics, intricate songwriting and blistering guitar work and spits them out as earnest catchy-as-hell rock. The full-length concert film is mixed with in-depth interviews with Ted Leo and images of one of the most unique places in America.
