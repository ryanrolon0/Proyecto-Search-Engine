The Watch

 In this paranormal thriller, Cassie, a psych student, was kidnapped and traumatized as a child by a disturbed person. To exorcise her demons and to finish her thesis, she decides on an experiment in isolation, working at a secluded watch tower as a fire lookout. But once she's alone, strange things start happening. Or is she just paranoid? Cassie is terrified that her past may be coming back to haunt her. At the age of nine, Cassie Malloy was kidnapped and locked in a basement for two days. Nineteen years later, the traumatized Cassie studies psychology at the Braxton University and needs to work on her thesis. Cassie decides to accept a four-week job working alone in an isolated fire watch tower in the forest to vanquish her demons from the past. Cassie leaves her best friend Andrea and travels to the spot, where she meets the forest guard Rhett that brings Cassie to the tower. Cassie feels the effect of the isolation and experiences weird things but she is comforted by Polly, the lookout of the east tower. When Rhett visits Cassie, she learns that Polly died five years ago in a fire. Cassie decides to quit her job, but Rhett recalls her that she signed a contract and he needs at least two days to find a replacement. Cassie agrees to stay while Andrea receives a strange phone call for Cassie.
