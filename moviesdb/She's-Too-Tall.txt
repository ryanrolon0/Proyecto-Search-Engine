She's Too Tall

 In the glamorous and competitive world of hi-fashion, Veronica Lamar now designs the clothes that she once modeled on the runway. While very successful with the "department store set" she longs to break back into the hi-fashion arena now dominated by Alonzo Palermo, her online mentor and present day rival. Doug Beckwith gets the contract to manufacture the clothes that Veronica designs for a big fashion show. But when he makes a mess of things, Veronica storms out leaving him to his own devices. With fierce competition and some back stabbing by Alonzo, Veronica suggests a merger between she and Doug "in the matrimonial sense" and their partnership is forever sealed.
