Reminiscences of Yearning

 REMINISCENCES OF YEARNING is so many ghosts, searching the landscape for traces. there's no sense of the past- it's in the present, searching the footage for what remains, a summoning of the disappeared. We're invited to patiently wait and see if they appear or not. A ritual.. at least.
