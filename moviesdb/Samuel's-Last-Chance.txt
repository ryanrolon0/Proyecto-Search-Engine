Samuel's Last Chance

 Samuel has been given a month to find a decent job or his girlfriend is leaving him. He puts it off until the last day and has three interviews lined up. He stops by his friend's house to borrow a briefcase to look professional for the interviews and on his way out, he passes a Chinese family who are also picking up a briefcase from the same house. Unfortunately for all of them, Samuel grabbed the wrong briefcase and the chase begins - the Chan Gang desperately trying to get the briefcase meant for them and Samuel completely clueless as to why they're after him.
