Two Gun Law

 Another in the series of early-Charles Starrett westerns in which Columbia used the name of prolific writer Peter B. Kyne to imply he was the author and also in charge of the production by putting his name above the title, i.e."Peter B. Kyne's TWO GUN LAW" and also having a credit line reading "A Peter B. Kyne Production." He neither wrote nor produced any of the Columbia westerns circa 1936-37 billed as such. Plot has outlaw Wolf Larson wounded in an ambush by a posse headed by Sheriff Bill Collier. Larson, because of his affection for his adopted son Bob Larson, had decided to go straight before the ambush, and instructs the loyal Cookie to take Bob away and get him started on an honest job, and keep in touch with him by mail at the town of Mustang as he has a hideout nearby. Bob thinks Wolf was killed in the gun battle with the posse. Bob and Cookie ride to Mustang and are about to ask Len Edwards, foreman for the ranch owned by Colonel Ben Hammond, for a job when they overhear Edwards and some of his cronies plotting to rustle the Hammond herd. Bob and Cookie warn Hammond and help drive off the Edwards raiders, and the grateful Hammond makes Bob, who says his name is Maxwell, the foreman and gives Cookie a cowhand job. Bob meets and falls in love with Hammond's daughter Mary. Cookie writes Wolf advising him of their whereabouts, but Wolf's lead henchman, Kipp Faulkner, opens the letter first, and heads for Mustang with a plan of his own. Meeting Edwards, who wants revenge on Bob, Kipp outlines a plan that will force Bob, through fear of the law learing of his past, to help them rob Hammond. Bob, in order to keep the Hammond payroll out of the hands of Kipp and Edwards, robs Hammond himself to save the money but is captured by the gang and now has the law and the outlaws against him. Cookie sends for Wolf and bullets begin to fly.
