Suppressant

 Set in a world ravaged by a plague that has forced humanity to live in fear behind the veil of gas masks, Suppressant, tells the story of Paul, an "immune." In order to survive, Paul must hide his immunity as he sells temporary viral suppressants to the community. The suppressant allows citizens to live mask-free for up to three days. While Paul tries to ignore societies problems, he is forced to confront the dark reality of what people will do in order to regain their humanity.
