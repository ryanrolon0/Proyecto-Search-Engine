That's My Story!

 A reporter desperate for a story tries to interview a gangster's girlfriend jailed in a small town. He gets himself thrown in the same jail and runs into a female reporter with the same idea, but thinks she is the girlfriend he wants to interview. Cub reporter Howard Field has been fired from every newspaper in the city with the exception of the "Express," where city-editor Cater gives him a last-chance assignment. He is instructed to get a story from Bonnie Rand, accused of killing her millionaire boyfriend. She is being held incommunicado by Sheriff Otis who hates all reporters and newspapers. Field gets himself arrested and thrown into jail. Escaping from his cell window, he discovers a beautiful girl in the next cell and assumes she is Bonnie. Actually, she is Janet Marlowe, a reporter for the "Clarion," who has also schemed her way into the jail to get Bonnie's story.
