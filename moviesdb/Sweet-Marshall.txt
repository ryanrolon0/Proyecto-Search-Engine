Sweet Marshall

 With a flip of a coin, it all comes crashing down; arrested for a robbery he didn't commit. Transforming into master chameleon, jail becomes his playground; weaving his master plan. Early release brings him more than he bargained for, kidnapped, drugged and tortured. Marshall is caught in a sticky web of lies and seduction. Or is he?
