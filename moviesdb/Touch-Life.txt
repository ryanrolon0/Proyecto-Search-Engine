Touch Life

 Dressage, classical training of the horse, can be traced back to the Greeks over 2,500 years ago. The Greek soldier Xenophon, pupil of Plato, was the first to write of it in 400 BC. Though initially a training system developed for horses on the battlefield, Dressage has evolved from a strictly practical use to one that enriches our lives through the feeling of such incredible harmony and bond with the horse. It is the kind of feeling that gives you chills, transcends you from reality and inspires you to reach for it again and again. We must all strive to find that in life which moves us to such heights of emotional fulfillment and pursue it with unwavering devotion.
