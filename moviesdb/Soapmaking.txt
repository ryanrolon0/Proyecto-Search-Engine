Soapmaking

 Any fragrance you desire in soap could be yours when you create your own. No more hunting for soaps with your special fragrance. You can now create your own at a fraction of the cost. Love the smell of lavender, jasmine, sandalwood, or even vanilla in your bath, then add these essential oils or fragrance oils. Or you can omit the fragrance all together and still have a superior bar of soap.
