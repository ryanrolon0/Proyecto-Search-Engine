Sleepwalk

 A restless young man who's been drinking, wanders the industrial section of his Brooklyn neighborhood to meet another restless soul of the opposite sex. They drink, laugh, and dance there way into the bedroom. The morning light of the next day exposes them as strangers as now they struggle to keep alive what they wonderfully shared the night before.
