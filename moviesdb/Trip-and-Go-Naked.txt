Trip and Go Naked

 Trip And Go Naked documents a transgressive variety show that took place in the dead of night over the course of a sweltering New York summer. Shot in the East Village's famous Pyramid Club, the film chronicles the efforts of the indomitable Mistress Otter and her band of performers as they up the pain and perversity ante in an escalating series of emotionally intense and dangerous actions.
