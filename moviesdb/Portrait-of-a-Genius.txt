Portrait of a Genius

 The genius of the title is Leonardo Da Vinci. This short looks at many items that we think of as modern military inventions. It turns out that Da Vinci developed them, in rudimentary form, hundreds of years earlier. They include the parachute, steam cannon, submarine, tank, and a machine gun with multiple barrels. He also invented an adjustable telescope, transmission gears, and a multiple-belt drive system.
