Sosulki

 A close look at icicles as natural sculptures. Through the framework of a Russian perspective, icicles are explored as a collaboration between human creation and natural designs. Beginning with an epigraphical excerpt of Boris Pasternak's poem 'March,' this film dives into frozen bushes, climbs to rooftops and studies both day and night in the life of the icicles. Documentary narration is provided in Russian, but comprehension is not essential. 'Sosulki' relies primarily on visual and musical stimulation to provide a greater understanding of the powerful and fleeting image of the icicles.
