 Crystal Wylder is the forewoman on a jury deliberating over a riveting criminal case. The defense and prosecution have finished their presentations, and now the fate of the defendant is in the hands of the jurors. Trouble is, the jurors are in each other's arms. When the jury room doors close, the ladies are thrown into a frenzy of unrestrained lesbian lust. They ignore the evidence and instead study each other's supple, inviting frames.
