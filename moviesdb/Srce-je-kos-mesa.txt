Srce je kos mesa

 A Wordless and virtually soundless but nonetheless exquisitely sensitive drama about an overweight butcher who lives alone and the strange fascination he develops for an attractive young woman he sees on his regular bus route. He takes tentative steps to approach her but though he receives an open, caring smile, fails to respond.
