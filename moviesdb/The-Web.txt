The Web

 Dawn is a typical teenage girl, pretty, popular, active and anxious to grow up. When Don Wilk contacts her online he seems to not only share all of her interests but also to understand her in a way that no one else does. What Dawn doesn't know is that the man on the other side of their IMs and text messages isn't at all what he says he is, and she's his next victim.
