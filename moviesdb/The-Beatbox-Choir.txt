The Beatbox Choir

 The Beatbox Choir follows Shlomo, acclaimed British Beatboxer, as he attempts to push the boundaries and break common preconceptions of the vocal art of beat-boxing by creating the worlds first Beatbox Choir. We witness the joys and stresses from the first time they meet until their first performance, headlining The International Beatbox Convention at London's prestigious concert hall, The Southbank Centre. From the day the group meet until first public performance, we see the creation of Shlomo and the Vocal Orchestra. Through experimental techniques, we watch the group step out of their comfort zones as they perform in ways they'd never had thought likely.
