The Fighting Terror

 Cowhand Bill becomes known as the Fighting Terror, when he sets out to get revenge on the outlaw gang that shot and killed his brother. The gang operates on the California/Nevada border and, with the help of a crooked sheriff, crosses the state line to thwart pursuit and capture from pursuing posses. Bill ignores the state line in his vengeance quest.
