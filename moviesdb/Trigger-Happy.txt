Trigger Happy

 When two childhood friends get together, they struggle to come to terms with the differences between their idea of what and who they would become and what they actually have done with their lives. Lou works for his family's auto dealership and when he meets up with William his best friend from his childhood, their day spent together becomes a race against the clock as they explore dangerous territory from arming themselves to checking out a drug dealer's hideout, all in the hopes of finding the excitement they both lack in their lives. A rapid-fire comedy about the extreme nature of friendship and what happens when you find yourself just 'coming along for the ride'.
