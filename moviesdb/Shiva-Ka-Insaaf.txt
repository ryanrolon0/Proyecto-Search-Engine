Shiva Ka Insaaf

 Shanta and Prakashnath are brutally killed by Jaggan and his men, and the only witness is their child, Bhola. Bhola turns for help to his dad's friend, Ram, who accepts Bhola, and introduces him to two close friends, Rahim, and Robert. Together they bring up Bhola, and teach him all that is to know about fighting, and combat. Years later, Bhola has grown up, and his three mentors have provided him a new name - Shiva, and heavenly weapons to assist him overcome evil in this world, as well as to seek out the killers of his parents, and end their tyrancy.
