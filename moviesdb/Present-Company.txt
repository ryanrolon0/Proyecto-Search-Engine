Present Company

 Set within the confines of a small dimly lit bedroom the morning after a heavy night of drinking, 'Present Company' depicts how an imperfect companionship can be maintained if the fear of loneliness outweighs the desire for (and belief in) true love. Battling feelings of dejection and the regrets of the previous night, Daniel and Amy toil to endure each other's company as they cleave to and tear away from each other, engaged in a futile struggle for power. Driven by a frustrated and bitter nature, Amy teeters on the cusp of an emotional collapse while hurling malice and resentment against her lover. In turn, she ignites his spiteful response, a response fuelled with disdain and a sense of despondency for their present companionship that borders on the realms of both mental and physical abuse. However, when one of them receives a discrete phone message from an elusive admirer, an alternative path presents itself and they begin to contemplate a way out, away from their present company.
