She Meets with Wife's Approval

 This is an excellent comedy scene. The wife visits her husband's office to inspect the young woman he has engaged as his stenographer. When the wife enters, the new typewriter is wearing a hideous mask, and the wife goes away satisfied. When the wife is gone, the girl removes the mask, and receives the congratulations of her employer.
