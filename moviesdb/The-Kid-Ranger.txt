The Kid Ranger

 Ranger Ray plans to marry stage driver Bill Mason's daughter Mary. Unknown to Mary, twenty years earlier when he was Sheriff Mason had to kill her father. Brent was there at the time and now he reappears. To keep the secret, he forces Mason to help him rob the stage. Ray breaks it up and after wounding a disguised Mason, goes for a Doctor. Returning he finds not only has Mason disappeared but also his daughter. Reformed outlaw Bill Mason (William Farnum) is living a happy life with his adopted daughter Mary (Joan Barclay as Geraine Greear), and his greatest fear is that she will learn that it was he who killed her father through circustances beyond his control. Steve Brent (Earl Dwire), one of Mason's former gang who knows the situation regarding Mary's real father, shows up. Mary is engaged to Texas Ranger Ray Burton (Bob Steele), whose dad (Lafe McKee) is in the hospital from wounds received in an encounter with the notorious El Lobo gang, the name under which Brent operates. Under threat of having his secret revealed by Brent, Mason helps hold up the stage, the outlaws scatter and Mason has the money bag and is being trailed by Ray, who does not recognize the disguised Mason. A bullet from Ray's gun drops Mason just as he reaches home, and Mary thinks Ray has killed her foster-father but he recovers. Brent, actually the man who had shot Mary's father and left it to Mason to assume he did, gets the money and also has Mason and Mary help captive in a cave hideout. Ray is on the trail.
