Villiljós

 Five stories interwine into one. A blind man hovers above the city. Everything looks set for a perfectly normal evening in Reykjavík, until the the power goes off? The door of a bank ATM locks as a pregnant girl inside goes into labour. A hearse driver, fighting off a ghost with the help of his parrot, races wildly through the darkened streets. A newly engaged couple's romantic night out goes sour when an older couple try to teach them what life is all about. And a plane strays off course, while the rock group on board and everyone in town that night tries to see the light in the darkness.
