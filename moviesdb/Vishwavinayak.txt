Vishwavinayak

 Chronicling the many trials and hardships inflicted upon a poor village Pandit Vishwa Buva, a devotee of Bhagwan Shri Ganesh, his devout wife, Tulsi, his atheist step-brother, Shankar, on whom they are financially dependent, and the oppressive village Patil, Sarjerao. Things only get worse when Shankar stops sending money after losing his job, returns home, remains unemployed, refuses to pay veneration at the Mandir, while Sarjerao buys out the heavily mortgaged house of Vishwa, and then has him arrested for stealing jewelry from the Mandir.
