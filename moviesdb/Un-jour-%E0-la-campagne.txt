Un jour à la campagne

 Mathilde, 12 years old, catches her parents, yet again, in the middle of an argument. She runs away with her two little brothers Robin and Louis. While hanging out in a park they get into a quarrel with a couple of teenagers. To escape, they hide in the back of a pick-up truck, which unexpectedly takes off and takes them deep in the countryside, far from home. At first they feel the allure of freedom and adventure in the sunny landscape. But the country journey takes a different turn when a man with doubtful intentions approaches them.
