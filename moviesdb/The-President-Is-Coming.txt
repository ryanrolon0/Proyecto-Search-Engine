The President Is Coming

 In 2006, George Bush, President of The United States, visited India. In addition to the many diplomatic and political things on the agenda was a rather unique event - a meeting with one of the young faces responsible for shaping "The New India". This is a fact. The rest is fiction. The US Consulate hires a dysfunctional PR agency that "knows America" to find 1 young Indian to be the face of the New India before The American President. The agency brings in 6 Young Indians who have been selected by NDTV as the "top Indian achievers under 30". The winner is to be selected in a day through a round of bizarre tests that get progressively tougher in a room in the US Consulate. The President will shake their hand among a long line of waiting Indian luminaries, the next day. Each is desperate to win and will resort to any means to do so.
