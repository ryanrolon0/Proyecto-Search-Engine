Shadows

 The film depicts the last moments of a man who loses his sweetheart and commits suicide, but not before he endures without her through a series of uneventful moments in his life symbolized by shadows and empty landscape. She employs the words of the famous poet Ahmed Al-Mullah to touch on the sentiments of loss and loneliness.
