After Spenser and Leroy are tragically killed, Fool tries to escape. Running for his life, he bumps into the landlords' daughter, Alice, a young abused girl full of nothing but scars and fear. Fool feels sympathy towards Alice and persuades her to escape with him. Fool then finds out that the evil and sadistic landlords are not a married couple but brother and sister who kidnap young boys and keep them locked up in the cellar. Fool will stop at nothing to save them and in the end Fool becomes the movie's hero.
