The Totville Eye

 Scotty and his young helper Sammy do the printing for the local newspaper, The Totville Eye. Scotty has ideas for improving the paper, but his stodgy editor refuses to change anything. When the editor is called away by a family illness, Scotty is left in charge. He soon puts Sammy to work as a cub reporter, and the stories in the paper's next edition are quite a bit different from its usual content.
