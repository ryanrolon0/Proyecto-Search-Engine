Red Scream Nosferatu

 Red Scream Nosferatu is an edgy, blood-drenched revisioning of the classic original vampire film. When Jonothan Harker travels to the castle of Count Orlok on business he instead becomes a prisoner of the Count and the plaything of the Count's three vampire brides. When Orlok abandons the castle to make Jonothan's wife Mina his new love, the three brides seek to transform Jonothan into their new master through a ritual of torture and blood. Fusing elements of the original film and the original Dracula novel with a steampunk aesthetic Red Scream Nosferatu pays respectful homage to the original film while infusing new blood into this classic vampire tale.
