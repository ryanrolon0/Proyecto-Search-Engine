Vi gifter oss

 Petter and Kari meet, fall in love, and get married. But it is not easy for a young couple of limited means to find a place to live. Moving in with Petter's parents proves impossible, Kari can't endure her mother-in-law's constant interference. Trying to build a house of their own is halted by so much red tape, and affordable rentals is hard to come by. When Kari gets pregnant things doesn't get any easier.
