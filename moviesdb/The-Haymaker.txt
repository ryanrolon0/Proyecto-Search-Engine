The Haymaker

 Davis, 19, spends his days stealing cars in the neighborhood. When he is caught trying to break into the car owned by the trainer (George) of the local boxing gym, an unlikely friendship begins. George begins to train Davis in boxing, but really intends to provide a sense of direction in his life, but Davis struggles to define himself. A stagnant foul-mouthed adolescent joins a boxing club in the hopes he will find himself. He crosses paths with a young boxing trainer carrying a chip on his shoulder who brings the teenager from reckless youth to disciplined adult before he realizes that boxing is no easy way out.
