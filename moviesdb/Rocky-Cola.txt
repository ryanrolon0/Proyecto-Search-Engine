 A widower wakes from a dream where his deceased wife tells him that she will no longer visit him in the night. He then finds himself searching for answers at the diner where they first met. There, he meets a prostitute who is weary of this life and contemplating going on one more day. Through a conversation about dreams and a dangerous encounter, the two lifeless strangers find new strength in each other.
