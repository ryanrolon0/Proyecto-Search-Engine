Shades of Mourning

 A father of three dies at home having suffered from M.S. for many years. His death is assisted with an overdose of drugs admitted by his youngest son. The family are old money, with a large home. The funeral takes place and sees only a few people attend. Among the people however are the adult children. After the funeral service at a church, the three adult children convene in a large drawing room. They're there to discus what they believe to be a large inheritance that is coming their way. The eldest son, Max, is a successful businessman. He is arrogant and cool showing distain for his father. He is drinking and smoking in large amounts. The second, the only daughter, Alice, lives in Paris with her family. She talks about how she wishes she had been closer with her father before he died. She is very upset throughout the meeting and seems to be dealing with it by blaming her brothers for things. The youngest is very quiet man, Adam. He is clearly very upset but not talking about it. He is the brunt of a lot of his sibling's anger as we find that their mother died after giving birth to him. It is in the balance of blame and accusation that the drama is set.
