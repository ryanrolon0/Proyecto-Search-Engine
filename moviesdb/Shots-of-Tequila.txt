Shots of Tequila

 "Shots of Tequila" is a dramady about Lakeisha Love, a young woman who is court ordered to see a psychologist regarding her abrasive behavior during an animal protest. During her intense visits, the therapist makes her revisit her childhood, and all the painful memories of her drug dealing mother in the 1970s. These reflections force Lakeisha to examine her alcoholism as well as her inability to have a mature committed relationship.
