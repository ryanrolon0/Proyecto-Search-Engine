Reel Justice

 A unique interactive movie where viewers make decisions as a police officer investigating a violent assault in a college town. What looks like a simple mugging turns out to be not so simple. Reel Justice takes the concept of active learning to a whole new level. Viewers take on the role of a police officer and influence key plot turns by making choices for the officer. You enter the world and work of a police officer and see issues from an up-close and decision-making perspective. Sold as a self-contained educational interactive movie or packaged with the top Criminal Justice textbooks from McGraw Hill Higher Education, this interactive movie is a riveting drama and powerful learning tool.
