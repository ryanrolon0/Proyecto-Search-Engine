Sahkanaga

 In the winter of 2002, over 300 bodies were discovered strewn about the property of the Tri-State Crematory in Noble, GA, in various stages of decay. "Sahkanaga" imagines this event from the perspective of a teenager who discovers the first body. Filmed on location in Walker County, GA, with a cast of non-professional actors, some of whom had direct connections to the real-life scandal, "Sahkanaga" observes a tight-knit community on the brink of a terrible tragedy and their efforts to make sense of the unknowable.
