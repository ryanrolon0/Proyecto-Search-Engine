The Dog and the Bone

 In this first (and close to the last) cartoon done in Sepia Tone, Puddy the Pup is walking along with a bone in his mouth and, while crossing on a log running over a stream he sees the magnified reflection of the bone in the water. An impish devil appears and urges him to drop his bone and dive into the water after the bigger one. He does and finds nothing while losing his bone. He finds another bone at an Italian restaurant and as he returns over the same stream the imp appears again. Will Puddy be fooled again?
