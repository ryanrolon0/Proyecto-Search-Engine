Two Minutes Away from Launch

 Two Minutes Away From Launch is a story about two pigeons Fred. We introduce the story in a fashion suggesting that they are unable to fly, for some inexplicable reason. Einstein decides that he just has to fly, and proceeds to carry out all manners of ridiculous methods to get himself airborne, including rockets, catapults and giant flying machines. While Einstein does this, Fred is characteristically unconcerned. He busies himself with the most mundane of tasks, seemingly extremely low on brain activity, thereby earning himself the air of a "dumb pigeon". In the end, though, Fred is the one who has the last laugh. Einstein completes his exaggerated aviation craft, only to watch in stark disbelief as Fred simply flaps his wings and flies away.
