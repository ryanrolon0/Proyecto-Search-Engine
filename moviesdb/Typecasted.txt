Typecasted

 Angelo (Frank Fata) and Tony (Adam Piacente) will do just about anything to make it in showbiz. Even if that means constantly playing characters that portray the stereotype they worked their whole lives to avoid. There's more to the Italian culture then the Mafia. Angelo and Tony set out to prove just that. Come follow your paesano's on a series of auditions that will show how cultural discrimination effects us all. Does Angelo and Tony have what it takes to prove to the best in the business that they are more then just a pair of one dimensional goombas...........Fugetaboutit!
