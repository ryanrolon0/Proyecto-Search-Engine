Poldermol

 Koen (11) is secretly in love with Annemieke, the most gorgeous girl in the whole world. He tries to please her with treasures he digs up from the soil of the Dutch polder. But Annemieke doesn't really appreciate his presents, which include the skulls of little animals. When Koen finds an old bomb, he is sure he'll be able to conquer Annemieke's heart at last. He takes the bomb with him to school, resulting in an extremely explosive situation.
