Supermarket Musical Massacre

 A seemingly typical housewife embarks on a trip to the local supermarket. Once inside, she is confronted with the same scene she faces every day endless queues of judgmental neighbors, walls of gaudy advertising, and aisles and aisles of products she doesn't need and can't afford. As her frustration grows, the cacophonous sounds of the supermarket build to a discordant climax, and eventually, she snaps. The result is a joyous musical rampage through the aisles that is fun for the whole family. The prosaic becomes sinister, fantasy becomes reality, and aisle nine becomes a site of mass destruction. Keep in step with the mindless violence, choreographed carnage, and multiple harmonized fatalities in Musical Massacre
