The Pigskin

 Two old friends own a valuable piece of football history. The first two super-bowls were a failure. They were going to cancel the Superbowl. Superbowl III and Joe Namath change all that and they own the signed game ball. Down on their luck, one wants to sell it - the other one says they'll sell that over his dead body. This is their story.
