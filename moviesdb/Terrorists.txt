Terrorists

 "Terrorists" is a comedy about life in post-9/11 America small-town police chief, unhappy with his lowly status and eager to prove himself in the War Against Terror, interprets a series of unrelated events as proof of an impending terrorist attack. When a graduate student of Mideastern descent arrives in town to authenticate the world's largest stool, he unwittingly becomes the police chief's prime terrorist suspect. In creating this climate of fear, the chief acquires the power and the perks he's always dreamed of. And when he raises the town's alert level from brick to tangerine, panic ensues and common sense takes a holiday.
