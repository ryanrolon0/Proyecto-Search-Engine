Vesper

 Filmmaker Brock Labrenz, associate artist with The Forsythe Company, present's Vesper, a film that blends abstract dance and cinematic values to tell the physically exquisite and emotionally charged story of six dancers. The piece takes the audience on a journey through a futuristic dance landscape where the filmic elements and heightened physicality work in tandem to weave a tapestry of tonality ripe with reflection and interpersonal growth. It features choreography by Stuart Loungway & Brock Labrenz and captures performances by Terra Firma Dance Theatre.
