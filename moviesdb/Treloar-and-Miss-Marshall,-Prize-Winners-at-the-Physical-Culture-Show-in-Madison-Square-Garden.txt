Treloar and Miss Marshall, Prize Winners at the Physical Culture Show in Madison Square Garden

 On a white pedestal on a dark stage stands Beatrice Marshall, dressed in a leotard, with a thin sash slung low around her hips. She holds various poses of balance and grace, based on classical statuary. After about ten such poses held for a few seconds each, we see Albert Treloar, dressed in no more than jungle trunks, socks, and wristbands. He strikes various poses emphasizing his muscles. He flexes his arms and abdomen. He holds poses facing us and with his back to the camera. He wiggles his triceps and makes a slight bow.
