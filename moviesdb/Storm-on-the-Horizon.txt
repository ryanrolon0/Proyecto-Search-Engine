Storm on the Horizon

 On January 29, 1991, Saddam Hussein sent his three best armored divisions across the Kuwaiti border, into Saudi Arabia. This feature-length special tells how U.s. elite troops caught in their path escaped the enemy onslaught and then reversed the assault. Based on the book Storm on the Horizon and featuring extensive commentary from the author and many of the Marines who faced the Iraqi assault, this is the story of the first battle of the Smart-Bomb Age.
