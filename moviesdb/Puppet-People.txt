Puppet People

 A dysfunctional puppet team attempts to achieve their dream of greatness. Problems ensue when a certain puppet cannot be returned to the factory and must be used in the upcoming competition- but not if his puppeteer has anything to say about it... A substitute must be made last minute to pull off the finale and weeks of hard work.
