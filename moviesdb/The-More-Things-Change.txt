The More Things Change

 This documentary revolves around the Woodstock Music and Art Fair of 1969. As an attendee, the account is personal, but the scope is broadened to put the event into the context of the times. In the seventies and most of the eighties, I highlight how the concert falls into near obscurity, before being resuscitated by the building of a monument by a unknown welder, Wayne Saward. Continuing along this time-line, I mark significant US events, many of which resemble what got us into trouble in the sixties. During the 41st anniversary, I interview many of the varied revelers who continue to come to the original site and celebrate. Ultimately, The More Things Change, leaves one feeling that hope clings to live.
