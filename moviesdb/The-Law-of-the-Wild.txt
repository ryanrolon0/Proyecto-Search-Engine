The Law of the Wild

 Rex, a wild stallion, and Rinty, a police dog, are pals. Their master , John Sheldon, is framed for murder, and Alice Ingram plans to race Rex for money to pay for John's legal defense. Meantime, Frank Nolan, who has falsely accused John, sets out to steal Rex for himself. The only serial in which a horse (Rex), a dog (Rin-Tin-Tin, Jr.) and a cross-eyed comedian (Ben Turpin) are billed above the hero (Bob Custer.) The first two are understandable---they were better actors than Custer. Rancher John Sheldon (Bob Custer)ropes and tames Rex (Rex, King of the Wild Horses)and discovers he is the fastest thing on four feet. When Lou Salters (Dick Alexander), a ranch hand employed by Sheldon, attempts to steal Rex to train him for the track, both Sheldon and his faithful dog Rinty (Rin-Tin-Tin Jr.)try to stop him. Sheldon is wounded and Salters gets away with the horse. Sheldon recovers from the wound and sets out in search of the thief. Enroute to the track where he thinks Salters has taken Rex, Sheldon meets Alice Ingram (Lucile Browne) and her father (Lafe McKee), a well-to-do rancher and race horse owner. They are too late to keep Salters from entering Rex in a race which, unfortunately for Salters, the horse wins. Frank Nolan (Dick Cramer) wants to buy the horse but his offer is refused. Co-conspiritator Jim Luger (Edmund Cobb) shoots Salter and he and Nolan lay the blame on Sheldon, who is having no luck at all in proving the horse rightfully belongs to him, other than calling a lot of attention to himself. Sheldon is jailed and a lynch mob is gathering. But faithful Rinty is free, so there is hope...eleven more chapters up the road. Chapter Three may have serialdom's strangest title..."The Cross-Eyed Goony." Don't ask.
