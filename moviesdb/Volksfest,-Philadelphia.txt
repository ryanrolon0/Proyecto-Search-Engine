 Every year the German population of Philadelphia engage in what is known in Philadelphia as the "Volksfest." They congregate in large numbers and enjoy themselves, engaging in pastimes such as they used to in the Old Country. This is an excellent Life Motion Picture of the subject taken during the month of September, 1902, in "Philadelphia" Washington Park.
