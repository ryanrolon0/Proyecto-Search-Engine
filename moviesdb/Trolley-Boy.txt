Trolley Boy

 Trolley Boy is fed up with his job. He tries to lift his mood by inventing a little bowling game pushing shopping trolleys into stacks but, as he has set his goal too far away, he keeps missing it. His efforts and anger finally build up into a giant monster made of trolleys but it takes him a long time to realise that this unexpected creation is far more uplifting than getting a strike in his game.
