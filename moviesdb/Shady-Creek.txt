Shady Creek

 A prisoner -- out on weekend furlough -- becomes acquainted with the young son he has never met after returning to the town of Shady Creek where he was convicted of a terrible crime ten years earlier. When the daughter of the only witness to testify against him turns up dead, fingers immediately point to him, and only his son holds the keys to his absolution.
