The Rendering

 Ten years after being molested in art school by habitual rapist Theodore Gray, who is serving 25 years but eligible for parole, Sarah Reynolds leads a happy life in a gallery and with her handsome husband, lawyer Michael Reynolds, and helps police detective Nick Sousa, who put Grat away, as sketch-artist. Then new cases following Gray's MO occur, and a victim who got away gives a description Sara hesitates to confide to paper Michael scarily. She turns it in, yet once he's behind bars searches in and is blackmailed to plead Gray's paroling or his crime cahoots will torture Michael to death. Sarah Reynolds is leaving art school when she has a run-in with a freaky fan of her art who tries to kill her. A security guard comes to her rescue but the attacker gets away. Sarah is able to provide an accurate description to the police sketch artist and the attacker is apprehended. The attacker, Theodore Gray is sent away to state prison for 25 years. The movie jumps ahead ten years. Sarah is a successful Bostonian businesswoman and wife to Michael. Ten years have passed but the mental and physical scars of her attack are still fresh. To try to help herself by helping others who have been attacked Sarah aids the police as a sketch artist. While sketching one victim's description of an attacker Sarah realizes the sketched face resembles her husband Michael. Sarah confronts Michael about this who claims innocence but later evidence is found by police, conveniently, in their closet.
