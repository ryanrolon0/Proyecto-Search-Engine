Star Wait

 The new Star Wars film arrived on May 16 - so why not line up on the streets 6 weeks before? Hundreds of people in Hollywood did just that. Star Wait takes a look at the lives of some of these people waiting in line in front of the famous Mann's Chinese Theater. How do they get along with each other? How do they deal with the homeless people vying for sleeping room on the streets of Hollywood? How do they make sure no one spoils the new Star Wars movie for them? And of course, how do they go to the bathroom? Star Wait is broken up into 9 different episodes. Episodes include; who is hotter along with Star Wars fans at 2 in the morning? The day the tickets are sold, infighting among line members, and of course the final day leading up to the Hollywood 12 Clones."
