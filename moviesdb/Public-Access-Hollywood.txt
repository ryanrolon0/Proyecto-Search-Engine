Public Access Hollywood

 Hollywood California is the show business capital of the world. It is a Mecca for thousands of people seeking fame and fortune. While not everyone can be a star in Hollywood, anyone can be a star on PUBLIC ACCESS HOLLYWOOD. PUBLIC ACCESS HOLLYWOOD goes behind the scenes of public access in Los Angeles to follow some of its most prominent stars. The movie stars Francine Dancer, a homeless & handicapped, bikini go-go dancer who hosts her own variety show. The film also follows David Hart, who every week, along with sidekick puppet, Chip the Black Boy, teaches kids about Christian Science, the dangers of drugs and UFOs. Public Access TV is reality television in its purest form, but where does the television end and the reality begin?
