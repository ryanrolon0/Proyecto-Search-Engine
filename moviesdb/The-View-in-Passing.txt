The View in Passing

 Created using only a series of still photographs, The View In Passing is a breathtaking, personal postcard directly from the road. The film takes us across the gorgeous, ever-changing Canadian landscape, and into a reflective, single-driver road trip, as we remember what it is like to leave something behind while moving forward.
