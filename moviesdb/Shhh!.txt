Shhh!

 Arne is a lonely drifter through life, commuting between an infinite number of Mondays. But then one day something happens finds Love. But as we all know the world is infested with brutal vultures. You can always expect that around the next corner some bastard is waiting for you, ready to rock your world, even destroy you. Arne's happiness is short lived... Shhh! is a film about Love, Destiny, Death and existence's ironic cruelty. A story where the melancholic, existential and comic aspects of life are brought together.
