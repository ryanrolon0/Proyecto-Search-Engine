The Cobweb Hotel

 A spider runs a hotel for flies where he keeps his guests captive. A pair of fly newlyweds arrive and check in. Fortunately, the husband is "flyweight champion". After a pitched battle featuring arrows (fountain pen nibs) and a machinegun (aspirins shot from a perfume atomizer), the spider winds up in a bottle of library paste.
