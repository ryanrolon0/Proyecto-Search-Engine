Rock and Roll

 Rock and Roll the Movie follows fresh out of college guy David who moves to LA only to wind up in a bet with his teenage rock star agent idol, William Smythe over his cherished '59 T-Bird. To keep his car, David must convince a now washed-up rocker to return to the Rock and Roll spotlight for good.
