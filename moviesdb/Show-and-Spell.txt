Show and Spell

 A child's imagination is a powerful thing. It can change the world as we see it into a world they wish for. Billy's Grannie is a witch, and now he must tell the whole class about her. Is the story he tells real, or the work of his imagination? You decide. Billy Beresford hates reading out loud in class. He loves his granny. Today is a day Billy dreads - the class are reading their essays about 'important people'. Everyone else is confidently telling the class about Nelson Mandela, Winston Churchill and those sorts of people, but now it's Billy's turn. He has written about his granny. Has he messed up the assignment? To Billy, she is important - she is his granny, and...she is a witch. This is the story of how a child's imagination transforms the commonplace into special, mundane into magical, scary into funny, and death into a journey. It has been said that two of our greatest fears as humans are the death of a loved one and public speaking. Armed only with the power of his imagination, Billy battles both, and wins. SHOW AND SPELL combines all the elements that most short films won't touch witches, magic, flying sequences, ghosts. Watch it, lose yourself... and fall under its spell.
