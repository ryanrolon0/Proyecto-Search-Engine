There Is Nothing Out Here

 The San Diego music scene is thriving once again! A new, feature-length concert film captures a rich collection of live, full song performance from a handful of San Diego's independent bands. Filmed exclusively in San Diego over a span of 40 shows and 20 different bands, the film has the feel of a live show with the variety a mix-CD.
