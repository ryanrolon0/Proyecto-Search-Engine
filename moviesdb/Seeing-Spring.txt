Seeing Spring

 Two students enrolled in New England colleges - Vivian, an introverted English major, and Peter, a socially awkward film student - stumble upon friendship when they least expect to find it. At first wary of Peter's verbose outbursts and apparent petulance, Vivian comes to accept Peter's companionship and the discoveries it brings. Only when Vivian reluctantly agrees to star in Peter's final film project can the two help each other overcome the premature disenchantment they have with college life, reawakening their minds to the splendors of the world around them.
