The Moods

 The 16th of 16 musical shorts directed and produced by W. Lee Wilder featuring traditional southern-USA church spirituals and folk-music. A Negro chorus directed by 'Jester Hairston' (qv), lends their expert voices in their renditions of..."My Lord, What a Mornin'" and "Gimme Dat Ol' Time Religion."
