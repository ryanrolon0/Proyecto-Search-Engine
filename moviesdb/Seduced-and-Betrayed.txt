Seduced and Betrayed

 A beautiful but equally dangerous widow won't take "no" for an answer as she draws a dedicated family man into a world of passion, deceit and betrayal, threatening to destroy him in the process. When a scheming widow hires a young contractor to renovate her home, she quickly turns the arrangement into much more than just a construction job. As she manipulates her young employee into a torrid affair, her target finally gives in for one night of passion. Realizing what he has done, the younger man insists that he cannot continue the relationship, but he soon finds that much more than his reputation is at stake. When Victoria Landers contracts Dan Hiller, a married father with one son, for the restauration of her house, the o.k. converts for both of them in a little bit more than just a job.
