Poncho at Montreux

 In celebration of Concord Records' 30 Anniversary, Grammy Award-winner Poncho Sanchez took the stage of the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival, taking the audience by storm with a typhoon of his signature Latin rhythms. Absolutely riveting in performance, the bearded giant of Latin jazz is as much fun to watch as he is to hear.
