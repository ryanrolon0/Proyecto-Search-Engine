Three Too Many

 When Skyler Keel, Line Superintendent for the Pony Express, rides out of Utah with a remuda of horses he has no idea of what awaits him at Fort Bridger. Fate has dealt him four of a kind - all beautiful young women. Against a stacked deck he plays his hand for keeps and finds himself the legal guardian of his younger brother Matthew, and responsible for returning four young ladies to their parents across 300 miles of Indian country, as well as keeping the ponies running along the express trail. Fighting his way across Wyoming's mountain desert against Indians, and men on the outlaw trail, he learns many lessons about the fairer sex, and watches his younger brother make his first serious steps toward the man he will become when he is forced to shoot and kill. As the dust clears, Sky finds himself holding a full house - no longer alone, and headed for a new way of life
