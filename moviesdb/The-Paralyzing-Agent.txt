The Paralyzing Agent

 Dora has been haunted by terrible, out-of-this-world night terrors her entire life. Dr. Giles, a young widower still coming to grips with the loss of his beautiful wife, is Dora's anesthesiologist for an elective procedure. He finds that Dora is more than just a woman with nightmares. His quest is to discover the root of Dora's dreams, and at the same time make sense of a computer code that may have been guiding the planet since 1947.
