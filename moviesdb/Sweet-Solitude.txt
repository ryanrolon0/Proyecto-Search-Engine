Sweet Solitude

 Sweet Solitude is an experiment with sound and motion. There are no messages or hidden agendas, other than to reveal the discoveries made during my investigations. There is, of course, the seed of an idea or a bit of a plan when I begin, but I am quickly directed by the work, answering the needs, sorting the puzzles and discovering solutions through the aid of technology.
