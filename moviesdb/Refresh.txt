Refresh

 How can we [people] relieve ourselves when we are under stress? And what happens to those of us who cannot alleviate the mounting frustration? This piece seeks to illustrate these issues with a touch of humor. This piece is produced in a way that the audience can empathize with the experiences of frustration and indignation, which all of us share in our lives. Like the end of the movie, if such an event were possible in your life, would you not find it a fantastic way of coping with the stress? One might even find it refreshing, and perhaps astonishing and liberating.
