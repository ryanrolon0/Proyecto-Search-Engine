Ten Ichi, the Famous Japanese Magician, with His Troop

 This is one of the marvelous moving pictures that will hold any audience in awe. The Japanese are all known for the Legerdemain, but, in our opinion this is one of the illusions that outdoes every one of its competitors. It is truly wonderful.
