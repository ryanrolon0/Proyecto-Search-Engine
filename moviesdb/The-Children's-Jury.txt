The Children's Jury

 A montage presented by Gimbels. Film clips are spliced together; images appear, sometimes by association. Loggers fell a tree; later machines and elephants move logs. There are working elephants and circus elements. A barnstormer flies under an arch then kisses a woman. A girl sorts cotton. Native American men dance. People crowd on a boat; divers walk on the bottom of the sea; three others float in barrels. A blimp floats by. A man sits at a piano and chirps. The soundtrack doesn't always match the images. A child cries.
