Temaaften

 In a broadcast on Denmark's national day, Constitution Day, the issue of constitutional reform is debated. Topics include monarchy, church, national sovereignty, freedom of speech, and human rights, discussed in the studio and in filmed segments. Also, the constitutional developments in history are described, and winners of a constitution competition discuss the need for a new constitution, as do a group of invited politicians.
