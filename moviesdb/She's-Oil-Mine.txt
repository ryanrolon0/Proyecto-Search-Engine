She's Oil Mine

 Elsie, an oil heiress being wooed by a phony foreign nobleman, takes refuge in a plumbing shop where Buster and Monty are working on a boiler. They hide her and, in appreciation, Elsie offers Buster the job of fixing the shower in her home. Clementi, the foreigner, enters the house and gets into a scrap with Buster and challenges him to a duel. As the duelists step off their paces, a hunter fires a shot and Clementi and his entourage take off. Buster is Elsie's hero.
