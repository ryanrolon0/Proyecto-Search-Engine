The Pretty Typewriter; or, 'Caught in the Act'

 "An elderly, but very gay broker is seated at his desk dictating to his pretty typewriter. He stops in the progress of his letter and bestows a kiss on the not unwilling girl. As he does so, however, his wife enters. She is amazed and enraged. Taking her husband by the ear, she compels him to get on his knees. The pretty typewriter is greatly alarmed and bursts into tears."
