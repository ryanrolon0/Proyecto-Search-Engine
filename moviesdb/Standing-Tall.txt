Standing Tall

 Standing Tall found along the highways and back roads of the Lone Star State. Big Tex and Sam Houston are a few of the more well known Texas icons but lesser known statues like the Woofus and the dinosaurs of Dinosaur Valley help to highlight artistic and historical homages found among the roadside attractions of the ultimate Texas road trip.
