The Boy with a Thorn in His Side

 'The Boy with a Thorn in His Side' is a quirky, offbeat comedy about a teenager coming to terms with himself, his problems...his life. The film centres around Billy Heinlickburger, an unemployed 18 year old loser who is drifting through his days without a care in the world. He's got a few problems, you see. His parents for starters. His mother Gertrude is a nervous wreck while his father Jurgen is a bit...eccentric, to put it nicely. Billy's love life is something to behold as well. He still has strong feelings for his ex Susan, but she's moved on with her life. Billy's world is a strange one, for sure, but it is an forgettable, coming of age tale that you will forget.
