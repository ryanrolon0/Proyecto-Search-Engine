Von Trier's 100 øjne

 This is a documentary included on the Dancer in the Dark DVD. It explains the complicated process that utilized 100 cameras(or eyes) to capture as many possible angles at one time. By using this proces, Lars was able to create a "live" feeling to the film, especially in the non-musical parts. This process was invented by Lars von Trier and his crew and is entirely exclusive to this film. This documentary also reveals what Lars feels were the successes and the failures of using this technique.
