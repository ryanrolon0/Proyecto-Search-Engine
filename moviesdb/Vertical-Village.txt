Vertical Village

 5 Decades. 4 Buildings. 3 Generations. 2 Visions. 1 Master Builder. The innovative and pioneering 50 year history of the Seward Park Cooperative in the Lower East Side neighborhood of New York City comes to life through interviews with original residents, children, and everyone in between, as they speak of their gratitude to the man who changed the street scape, not only of their own neighborhood but also of hundreds of others throughout the city, Robert Moses.
