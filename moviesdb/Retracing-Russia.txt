Retracing Russia

 Almost 20 years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, all Russians feel differently about their country not-so-distant past, and they hold different views about the event that changed their lives forever. And it is not about imperial ambitions or geopolitical claims; it is about the psychology of people born in a country that does not exist any more, and whose memory is being actively cleansed by modern Russian ideologists. In our film we follow a photographer who digs out old stills from his archive, and goes on a two-month journey to try to find people the photographed 30-40 years ago. Will he succeed? What country he will see? And how is it different from what it was in the past?
