 In a decadent Circus in the middle of a large city today, the 'Strongest Man in the World' can no longer lift his elephant. Every artist does his best, but the once successful circus has lost its public. The trapeze girl decides to risk her own life, in a desperate attempt to help the man she loves find his lost self-confidence.
