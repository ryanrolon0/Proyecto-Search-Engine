Sidney's Family Tree

 Sidney the elephant is looking for a mother, even though he's 44. The hippo and giraffe turn him down, but a monkey that drops a coconut on Sidney's head takes him in (though her husband isn't completely sold on the idea). The husband tries several things to get rid of Sidney, to no avail. Finally, a girl elephant walks by, and Sidney chases after her but then brings her home, asking if they can move in for a while.
