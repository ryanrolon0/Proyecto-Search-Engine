Struggle, Journey of Life...

 a boy, who had completed his post graduation with merit, is hunting for a job... not getting it for two years even after genuine efforts. his father suggests him to be self employed by driving an auto rickshaw, but for him, if he has studied so much, job is he yearns for. overcoming the resistance within , he plies a rickshaws, simultaneously trying for a job....he puts a note on the back of the rickshaw, saying a postgraduate with 1st class needs a job, how does he get it...? an unknown customer gives him an introduction.... so.. ultimately, it's his auto rickshaw, which helps him get the job.... the one he had hated all through, becomes his beloved.. love or hatred are just the phases of mind...
