Spoonfed Reality

 Spoonfed Reality investigates the perspectives of two mystical drifters as they look for answers in these seemingly apocalyptic, dangerous and uncertain times. Munky, a former street kid, who often slept in the dark tunnels that maze under his city, candidly shares stories from his past; he recalls spending $1,800 a week on crack-cocaine, a crystal meth binge that kept him awake and riding his bike for six days straight, and what it's like to almost die overdosing on heroin. Munky exemplifies how hard drugs lead to hard drama, and he echoes many truths which are profound realizations of a life lived knocking on death's door. Interwoven with Munky's adventures, is the beautiful Kelley, another mysterious mystic, who unveils memories from her life lived on the flip side of mainstream reality. Kelley journeys deep into the desert mountains exploring the nature of death, the power of intention, lessons learned from psychotropics and other transformative matters. Spoonfed Reality leaves us wondering, what happens if we change the way we see the world?
