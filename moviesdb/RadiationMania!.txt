RadiationMania!

 Introverted, sensitive musician, Jason Miesse, and his freewheeling charismatic best friend, Brian, discover that a worldwide nuclear holocaust and radiation poisoning isn't THAT bad if you find yourself holed up in a permanent safety bunker with a selection of the world's most amazing women - which they do! But, Jason's end of the world fantasies quickly mutate into an endless oblivion when the women completely ignore him for the natural born Casanova, the secretly vasectomized Brian. Now, Jason must overcome his loneliness, jealousy, antisocial tendencies, dwindling food supplies, and radioactive hallucinations in order to save the human race.
