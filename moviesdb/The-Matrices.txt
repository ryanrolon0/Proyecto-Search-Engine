The Matrices

 Follows the adventures of aspiring screenwriter Neato Ampersand in the virtual labyrinth of the Los Angeles Film Industry. Neato attends Hollywood parties and takes the requisite meetings with powerful literary Agents, yet he cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong... that the world around him is a reality-based illusion... that what he really wants to do is act. After a disturbing encounter with an Agent, Neato meets McTrinity and McMorpheus, a pair of indie film rebels who show him the truth Los Angeles does not exist.
