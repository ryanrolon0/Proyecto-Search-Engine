Sight Unseen

 Sight Unseen is based on the amazing true story of Travis Freeman. A typical teenager growing up in Corbin, Kentucky, Travis is the town hero on and off the football field. In the fall of 1997, at the height of his career, he is unexpectedly stricken with a disease that destroys his optic nerve. He becomes blind overnight. Never abandoning his passion for football, Travis seeks the opportunity to return his senior year and play center with his teammates. The story follows Travis from his contraction of the disease through his struggle, not only on the football field, but in his relationships and a new life without sight. Though Travis' family supports him, his friend Jerry Baker provides the motivation and encouragement for Travis to push through the obstacles he must face. Jerry's reputation as a troublemaker precedes him, setting up a story where the inspiration becomes mutual between two friends. Travis Freeman is the first known blind person to play football. His accomplishments as a blind young man are the foundation for an emotional and heart-warming narrative.
