The Memorial Counselor

 BRYCE PHILLIPS is in trouble. His cushy high-tech job of four years disappeared in a nanosecond, and his wife, SARAH, dropped the bomb six weeks pregnant. So what's an unemployed soon-to-be father to do? File an unemployment claim and pray to the gods that the economy will soon turn around. Bryce quickly finds that unemployment does not suit him; as friends call to hit him up on pyramid schemes and community service. His parents sideline coaching in the employment and pregnancy arena is another mess altogether. Desperate for work he applies for a job on a whim based off a tip from a close friend. Lucky for Bryce he lands the job. Unlucky for Bryce there's one small problem. The employer just happens to be Crest Memorial Park. Welcome to the death business - Oregon style. Where the residents sleep all day, flowers bloom all year and the visitors never stop crying. Bryce is introduced to the mystical underground world of plots, crypts, niches, and urns. It's sales; only with a good dose of sobbing on the side. Bryce shortly discovers that working at a cemetery is a lot stranger than he ever expected. With a lively management and staff, insane funeral directors from hell, and patrons from every walk of life, it's more than a job, it's a retirement community.
