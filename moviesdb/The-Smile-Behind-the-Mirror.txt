The Smile Behind the Mirror

 For the past two years, Wade has immersed himself in programming his own video game. After hearing a childhood friend is leaving town, he realizes how far apart his old group has drifted, and attempts to organize a going away party. Frustrated by his friends' apathy, he becomes fixated on a computer that claims to be a time machine. Meanwhile his brother and sister-in-law adapt to their new identities as parents, and an archive librarian strives to leave her mark on history.
