Under Fiesta Stars

 A mine owner dies and leaves half to Gene and half to easterner Barbara Erwin. Gene wants to continue operation of the mine as requested in the will but Barbara wants to sell and leave with her half of the money. So she hires two lawyers not knowing they are crooks. They then sent their henchman out and Gene's life is soon in danger. Gene Autry ('Gene Autry (I)' (qv)) is managing a gold mine in accordance with the terms expressed in the will of his old friend, "Pop" Erwin, who had refused to sell it over the years because it gave needed-employment and income to bankrupt ranchers. Half-interest in the mine was also left to a niece of Erwin's, Barbara Erwin ('Carol Hughes (I)' (qv)), who prefers money to management. In order to achieve her mercenary goal, she employs two crooked-lawyers, Arnold ('Ivan Miller (I)' (qv)) and Fry ('Sam Flint' (qv)), not realizing they had been trying to gain control of the mine for years. Eventually, Barbara sees the error of her ways and, with Gene's aid against the schemes of the lawyers and their henchmen, law, order and peace emerge.
