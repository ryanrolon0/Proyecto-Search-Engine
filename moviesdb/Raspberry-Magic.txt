Raspberry Magic

 "Raspberry Magic" is a coming-of-age story about 11-year-old Monica Shah, who thinks she must win the science fair in order to bring her father back after he runs out on the family. She blames herself for her parents' problems, and takes charge when her mother falls into a deep depression. Set behind the backdrop of a beautiful forest, Monica's experiment uses touch therapy to help raspberries grow faster. She asks, is it nature or nurture that can truly help a being grow? Does it even matter? Through her ups and downs with her family, she learns that it's a complex question, and the answer isn't so simple.
