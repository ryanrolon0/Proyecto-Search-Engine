The Occult

 Harold saw a newspaper article, denouncing the Hindoo. He brought it to Edna, his sweetheart, who was a believer in the teachings of the Hindoo. Then Edna and Harold quarreled and parted. Believing that the Hindoo should know of the attack on him, Edna showed the newspaper article to him. When evening came, Edna had begun to regret the quarrel with Harold and she resolved to bring him back to her by the occult means taught by the Hindoo. Harold, who was at the same time in his room reading, was led to think of her by a line of poetry that he read. He then slept and had certain dreams that may have been suggested to his mind by the happenings of the day, dreams that finally drove him back to his sweetheart. His return to her took place just in time to enable him to be of service to her and to unmask the real character of the Hindoo.
