Transit

 May 1968 middle of it all, my 21-year-old brother Reinhard. He openly flirts with socialist tenants, partly out of protest against our conservative father. It is the last we hear from him. Eight months later, in January 1969, Reinhard is found dead. His suicide is baffling. What drove him behind the Iron Curtain, and what happened to him there? Nearly forty years later, I go in search of traces of his short life in East Germany.
