RomanticA

 Mr. Pilot drives his life-size model plane along the beach promenade between loving couples that are enjoying the view. Waiting for him at home is a beautiful woman. Whilst eating dinner, Mr. Pilot shows her a ticket for a romantic pleasure flight. During the flight he proposes that they marry than the plane loses control and crashes. After losing his wife he decides to build his model plane, which will only run along the ground. He names the model 'RomanticA.' Every day when he comes back from the promenade he recaptures in his mind, their last romantic moments.
