The Dealership

 'The Dealership' is about the dysfunctional world of Carson Luxury Auto Gallery, a family-owned, used-car dealership. Market collapse, credit crisis, the shrinking global economy -everything is conspiring against Rachel, Jack and Frank Carson. But this main street family isn't going down without a fight and will do whatever it takes to make the sale and live for another day.
