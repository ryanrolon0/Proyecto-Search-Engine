The Film Company

 Our camera crew visits a grant-funded production company that hasn't made anything, the only two people that seem to do any work are the receptionist and the janitor. When the company is told the grant officer in coming by for a surprise inspection, can they convince him to continue their funding despite the fact that they haven't actually made any films?
