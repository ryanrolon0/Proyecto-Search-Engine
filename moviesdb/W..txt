W.

 Heavily addicted to booze, drugs and women of all sizes, thirty-something George W. Bush is currently running for congress in western Texas . W's old fraternity buddy, Skip "Skippy" McDowell is along for the ride. Skippy moonlights as W's political advisor and designated wingman and occasionally offers the only voice of reason.
