Street Art and Reality in London

 In central London, Brick Lane, three street artists paint a portrait of a mother and child, starving and homeless, on a dilapidated building. The image touches the many viewers that walk by in this multicultural part of London. Behind the buildings facade and much to everyone's surprise, a similar story is being lived in real time; a group of Romanian workers live with no running water, amongst trash. The very subject of the artists' painting sadly proves itself a reality in 21st century London.
