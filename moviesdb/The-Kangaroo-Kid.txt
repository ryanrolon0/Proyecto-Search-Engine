The Kangaroo Kid

 Tex Kinnane (Jock Mahoney as Jock O'Mahoney), posing as a stage driver, goes to Australia to investigate a series of robberies at Goldstar. He makes friends at the saloon with Baldy Muldoon (Alex Kellaway) and barmaid Stella Grey (Veda Ann Borg). Lawyer Vincent Moller (Douglass Dumbrille), the leader behind the robberies, learns Tex's real identity, and frames a plot to blame the crimes on Tex.
