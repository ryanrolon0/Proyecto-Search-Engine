Ring of Spies

 The film is based on the actual events of the Portland Spy Ring trial in the U.K. A disgruntled Navy Clerk is transferred to a secret research establishment and is subsequently black-mailed/paid by Czech intelligence to procure secrets for them. He seduces the secretary who controls the most secret documents, and they enjoy the fruits of their treachery until the British authorities begin to close in on them. In Warsaw a heavy-drinking disaffected British Embassy naval officer has been handing over secrets to his local girlfriend. When he is moved to the underwater weapons research station at Portland, Iron Curtain spy Gordon Lonsdale contacts him and persuades him to do the same. Lonsdale is in fact part of a sophisticated spy network centred on the leafy London suburb of Ruislip where Helen and Peter Kroger live.
