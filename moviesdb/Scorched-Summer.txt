Scorched Summer

 Scorched Summer shows the impact of the Second Lebanon War on Israel's civilian population. The facts of the war are presented through the lenses of citizens and visitors, personal stories of the injured and killed, and interviews of residents and emergency workers; it tells humanitarian stories of lives thrown into turmoil or ended prematurely.
