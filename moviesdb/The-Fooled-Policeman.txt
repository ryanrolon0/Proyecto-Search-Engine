The Fooled Policeman

 An officer takes a prisoner to jail, but they stop on their way to imbibe in the flowing bowl. The officer drinks, but the prisoner throws his liquor under the table and continues to fill the glass of the policeman until he is in a stupor, when he ties him fast to his chair and escapes. The picture ends in a funny manner. When the officer tries to escape he makes a dash for the door, but the rope pulls him back with a jerk and he falls to the floor, meanwhile calling for assistance, which arrives in the shape of a gendarme and a waiter from the inn. Good, rich and funny.
