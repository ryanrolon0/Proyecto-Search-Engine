This Land Is Your Land

 THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND is a funny and moving look at the impact of major corporations on American life, told largely from the point of view of ordinary citizens. The film examines both evident and lesser known areas of corporate influence, hears how people across the country feel their own lives have been affected, and looks at some of the brave, compelling and sometimes hilarious ways in which individuals and communities are reacting.
