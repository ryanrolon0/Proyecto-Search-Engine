Skellikin Feet

 People are just dying to get into this after-hours dance club! Okay--it's really a graveyard. With no skin or guts to hold them down, the fashionably ultra-thin can kick up (or off) their heels all night long. Cut-paper, stop-motion, lowest-tech, original music. You'll catch yourself humming the theme song and tapping your own 'Skellikin Feet.' But at sunrise, it's back in the ground for you.
