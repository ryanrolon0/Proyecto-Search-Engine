Shriman Shrimati

 A rich and wealthy couple, Shankarlal and Parvati (Sanjeev Kumar & Raakhee) are appalled at the problems of the world, especially in households, so they decide to try and make things right - one household at a time. They first go the household of alcoholic Rajesh (Rakesh Roshan); his domineering mom (Lalita Pawar); and uneducated wife, Veena (Deepti Naval). Their second task takes them to the household of Vishwanath Gupta(A.K. Hangal); his son, Madhu (Amol Palekar) who has taken to drinking; and his attractive, outgoing, and wealthy wife, Aruna (Sarika). The couple go to work on these families to turn them around and improve and better their relations with each other.
