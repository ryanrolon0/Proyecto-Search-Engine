Rainbow Over the Rockies

 Driving a herd of cattle to market, Jimmy finds the trail has been fenced off by an old friend of his. While the two sides try to settle the matter peaceably, a man from each outfit get together to try and start a range war between them figuring they will end up with the cattle. When cattle are rustled, Jimmy finds the clue, horses with shoes that make tracks that look like cattle. Trail boss Jimmy Wakely and "Lasses" White are taking a large herd to Cheyenne for his uncle, Frank Porter, but are stopped by a large fence enclosing the new ranch of their old friend Charles Miller, whose children, Ellen and Bill, grew up with Jimmy. Miller's foreman John Harvin conspires with Jimmy's trail hand, Dave Warren, to create a range war between Porter and Miller as a cover for their rustling from both ranchers. Porter appeals to Sheriff George Perry for the return of his cattle that have been driven through the fence, but is told he will have to pay a bounty. Jimmy strikes an impasse between the two ranchers by staking a claim and building another fence, so that Miller has no road from his ranch to town. Jimmy then sets out to discover who the real culprits are behind the trouble.
