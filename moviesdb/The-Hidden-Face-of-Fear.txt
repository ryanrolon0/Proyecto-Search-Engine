The Hidden Face of Fear

 Since September 11, 2001, New York has become the center of a new epidemic of fear and anxiety. The Hidden Face of Fear recounts the studies of two of the world's leading experts on fear and memory, Joseph LeDoux and Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, and three emblematic stories of people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Panic Disorder, treated by the Center for the Neuroscience of Fear and Anxiety in New York. The study of individual case histories is the key for the new science of mind to find new psychological and biological ways of coping with fear and anxiety.
