The Swimmer

 Swimmer is an unflinching and revelatory look at adolescent sexual obsession at its most darkest and disturbing. This shattering drama opens up with a prologue from the protagonist, a fourteen year old boy, revealing his undeclared crush on a woman twice his age and a harrowing determination venomously penned on making her his own. When he fails to approach her, he seethes with frustrated desires. What follows is an uncompromising portrait of the struggles of a former potential Olympic swimming champion who now lives a reclusive life cloistered in her flat next to the boy's. He, unseen, patiently observing, becomes obsessed with the swimmer, provoking perverted sexual fantasies that lead to intense behaviour within him, bordering on the misogynistic. He ultimately turns her already troubled life upside down when their paths accidentally cross and they make acquaintance. The boy manipulates his way into her heart. Both are emotionally fragile and fetishes abound in the teenagers' mind. It isn't long before his desires become inexorable and he sets out to scupper what he can't have leading to an explosive nail-biting climax.
