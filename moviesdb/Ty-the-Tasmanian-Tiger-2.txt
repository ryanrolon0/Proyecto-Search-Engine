Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2

 TY attacked by Boss Cass' henchwoman Fluffy and the villain escapes, forming his own to country so he can have diplomatic immunity. To counter this, Dennis the Green Tree Frog forms Bush Rescue, an organization formed to counter Cass' plans. It includes Ty and Sly, his brother, Maurie as communications officer, Julius as inventor and Shazza as rescue pilot. They fight there way past disasters, both natural and Cass-Made, to learn that the cassowary is planning to use the 'warm-blooded-ness' from mammals to make Uber-Reptiles. He captures the entire town and is about to subjugate them to his experiments before he is thwarted by Ty, Sly and Shazza and the cassowary is returned to jail.
