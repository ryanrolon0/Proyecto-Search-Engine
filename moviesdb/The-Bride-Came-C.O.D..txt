The Bride Came C.O.D.

 Oil heiress Joan is going to elope with bandleader Allen whom she's known four days. Out-of-money pilot Steve is going to fly them to Nevada but makes a deal with her father to deliver her home unmarried. He flies off with her, an apparent kidnaping, but is forced down in the desert. The bandleader arrives with a preacher, but their marriage (in California, not Nevada) is not valid. Pilot Steve will marry her because her father is a millionaire. Charter pilot Steve Collins is able to stay one step ahead of girlfriends who want to marry him and the bill collector who wants to repossess his plane. His latest charter is Joan Winfield, a madcap heiress who is eloping to Las Vegas with vapid bandleader Allen Brice. When Steve finds out that her oil tycoon father vehemently objects to the marriage, he is able to negotiate with him to kidnap his daughter and deliver her to him in exchange for enough money to save his plane and business. Unexpectedly the aircraft goes down in an ghost town inhabited by an idiosyncratic but lovable old man. Trapped in the desert, the improbable couple soon find that opposites attract.
