Tera Mera Ki Rishta

 Canada-based Meet, along with his pushy mom, Natasha, travel to Punjab, India, in order to attend the wedding of his cousin, Harman Kaur. It is here he rather dramatically meets with Harman's friend, Rajjo, who lives with her widowed father, Gurniyal Singh. After a few misunderstandings both fall in love with each other - little knowing that Natasha has plans to get her son married to another girl by the name of Honey.
