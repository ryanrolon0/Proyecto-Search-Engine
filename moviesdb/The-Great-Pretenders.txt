The Great Pretenders

 A biting satire from the front lines of the American workplace, where layoffs are so routine they've created their own industry - outplacement. Elite Transition Services promises laid-off worker Scott Matter help finding a job and getting back on his feet. But as the job search grows increasingly desperate, Scott finds himself caught in a corporate purgatory where the absurdities of office life are brought into vivid relief.
