Vasikan häntä

 Two men are in love with the same woman. The one is a fine fellow, the other one is a practical joker. The fine fellow buys a box of pastry from baker Helin, but the practical joker buys a tail of a calf from saddler Sundell. While the fine fellow is dressing up and getting ready to meet his loved one, the practical joker change takes the pastry out of the box and puts the tail in it. The fine fellow and his loved one coo on a bench in Hämeenpuisto and on the slope of Pyynikke. Finally they open the box of pastry. The loved one gives a slap on the fine fellow's ear, when she notices the tail in the box. The End. (This synopsis of the film was publish in Elokuva-Aitta -magazine in 1933).
