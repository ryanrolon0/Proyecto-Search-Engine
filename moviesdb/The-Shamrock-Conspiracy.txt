The Shamrock Conspiracy

 Teddy Harrison has just recently retired from Scotland Yard and is planning to retire to a sheep ranch in Australia. However, it appears that he is not looking forward to it. And before he goes he wants to visit his estranged daughter who lives in New York. Once he gets there he discovers that her boyfriend is a police detective. He is currently working on a case, involving a serial killer, who appeared to have stopped killing a few years ago, but appears to have resumed. However, Inspector Harrison doesn't think that is what is going on.
