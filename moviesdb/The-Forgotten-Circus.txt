The Forgotten Circus

 With his last breath, The Ringmaster breathes life back into his circus. Suspended somewhere between worlds The Forgotten Circus perform to no audience. Mixing circus, physical theatre, and dance to create a surreal world that floods the imagination and seeps under the skin. The circus represents the place between worlds and the point at which one says goodbye to oneself.
