The Last Voyage of the Empress

 There exists in the annals of world history a monumental event, etched in tragedy and shrouded in mystery, that has been hidden by whims of historical circumstance. On May 29, 1914, the CPR ocean liner Empress of Ireland sank off the coast of Quebec, killing 1012 people. Even though it still stands as one of the world¹s greatest maritime disasters, it is not a widely known event because it was buried between the sinking of the Titanic and the start of WWI ­ and it¹s submerged in controversy.
