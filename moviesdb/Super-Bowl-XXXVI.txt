Super Bowl XXXVI

 Amid celebrations of America months after the tragedies of September 2001, the National Football League's AFC-NFC World Championship Game occurred in February 2002 between the AFC-champion New England Patriots and the NFC-champion St. Louis Rams. The Rams had won Superbowl XXXIV and were overwhelming favorites, while the Patriots had seen starter Drew Bledsoe injured and replaced by Tom Brady only to see Brady injured in the AFC title game and Bledsoe step in and win the game. The Patriots shocked the Rams early on and had a 17-3 lead, but a late Rams rally with a touchdown from Ricky Proehl tied the score, forcing a last-minute drive by Brady for one last opportunity to win.
