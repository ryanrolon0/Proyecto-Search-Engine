Quio

 In this short film Quio is put to a test something happens - the reflection of quio herself appears on the TV-screen, the water doesn't fall downwards anymore, the cutlery falls to the ceiling... gravitation is suspended. Quio has to orientate herself in a new way and then she discovers the advantages of the new room structure.- This almost 'gondryesk' video cites a kind of futuristic fifties aesthetics and is a play with space, camera and film technologies.
