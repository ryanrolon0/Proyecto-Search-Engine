The Block

 This is the story of three lifetime friends, one child, a lovable baby and one very peculiar woman. They're enjoying a very typical Saturday filled with BBQ and fun by the pool when tragedy strikes. In an instant, their lives are forever changed by the demons within a woman they thought they knew well. Their lives will never be the same.
