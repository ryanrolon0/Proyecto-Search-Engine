The Cage

 With THE CAGE we are thrown inside the famous streetball court at West 4th and 6th Avenue in Manhattan and into the lives of three people who call the tiny fenced-in court home. You'll meet Soxs, the fiery, ambitious young ball player who is out there everyday hoping to take home a championship title from the prestigious West 4th League, while balancing a wife and an 8-month-old baby. There's Samantha, a struggling artist, who is one of the few girls that grinds out there with the men, on a daily basis. And Sherman, the king of this concrete and chain-link jungle who's now in his twentieth year presiding over THE CAGE and isn't ready to pass on the crown just yet! Welcome to THE CAGE, where basketball isn't a livelihood, BASKETBALL IS LIFE.
