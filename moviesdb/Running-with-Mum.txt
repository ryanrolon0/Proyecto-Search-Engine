Running with Mum

 Mother and son walk along the route that she fled to safety while 12,000 of her fellow townsfolk burnt to death. They talk about the reality and the pointlessness of such an attack. She tells of the pain of phosphor bombs, the lack of medicines, the aftermath of infections and a scattered family trying to rebuild. She reflects on fear, on pain, on forgiveness, and on what the passage of time does to a city and its devastated citizens. The film is also a journey in the relationship between mother and son. It is a calm and powerful condemnation of civilian bombing.
