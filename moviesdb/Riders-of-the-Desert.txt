Riders of the Desert

 The Rangers in New Mexico are being disbanded but Bob Houston gets them to make one more ride. They go after the outlaw gang led by Hashknife. They catch Hashknife, but he escapes taking Barbara with him and Bob and Slim have to go after him again. Ranger Bob Houston is riding shotgun on a stage driven by Silver and carrying a valuable shipment when it is attacked by Hash-Knife Brooks and his gang, including Apache Joe, a sadistic half-breed and Gomez, who vies with Brooks for leadership of the outlaws.Silver is killed and Bob wounded in the arm. Bob makes it back to Ranger headquarters and is told by his father, Ranger Captain Dan Houston that they can officially do nothing as the Rangers have been disbanded by the New Mexico state government. After a farewell dinner, with rangers played by Glenn Strange, Chcuk Baldra and Cactus Mack singing "Auld Lang Syne", they all go their own ways, with Bob going back to college. A few months later, Bob learns that Jim Reynolds, the former head of the Rangers and father of the girl Bob loves,Barbara Reynolds, has been murdered. Also in the interim, Brooks had been captured but had escaped and is suspected of being responsible for the killing. Buck Lawland, a former Ranger, spots Apache Joe in town and trails him but Joe sees Buck and kills him. Bob and Barbara are riding in the area, see the killing, and Bob sends Barbara back to town while he takes after Joe. The Rangers have all banded back together and they track down the gang, climaxing in a massive battle between the Rangers and the outlaws, while Bob saves Barbara, who has been captured, from a quicksand pit, after Slim shoots Brooks, which provides the answer to the trivia question of in what film did "Fuzzy" kill "Gabby"?
