The Situation

 The Situation is a documentary about parking at Millburn High School (once voted top high school in new jersey and the U.S.). The problem that most students, teachers, and residents in the area have a problem with is used as a launching pad to talk about other problems with the attitudes of the people involved. The ignorance of the residents that often plagues the town, the way that the student allow themselves to be pushed around, and the do nothing policy of the school and government are exemplified in this issue. This one problem allows for a view at the true colors those who halt progress in this town and maybe even other towns.
