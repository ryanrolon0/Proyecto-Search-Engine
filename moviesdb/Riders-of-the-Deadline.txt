Riders of the Deadline

 With writer Bennett Cohen recycling the same script he had used at Republic in 1941 for Don Barry's "Desert Bandit", this 50th entry in the "Hopalong Cassidy" series finds Ranger Hopalong Cassidy falling into disrepute and leaving the service, because of the death of his pal and young protEgE Tim Mason, who had lost his good standing through the suspicion that he was implicated with a band of smugglers, who had been using his ranch as a hideout. With the aid of his pals, California Carlson and Jimmy Rogers, Cassidy tracks down the outlaw gang, invades their hideout, and captures or kills the leaders, and regains both his and Tim's good names, while revealing his discharge from the Rangers was a plot hatched by him and Ranger Captain Jennings. Tim Mason has run up a gambling debt and is unable to pay. When he becomes a Ranger, Banker Crandall forces him to let his gang smuggle guns across the border. When he is jailed for being away from his post, Crandall has him killed to keep him from talking. Being suspected of aiding Mason, Hoppy is kicked out of the Rangers. But it's a plot between Hoppy and the Captain so Hoppy can join the gang. When Hoppy's friend Tim Mason gets in trouble with gamblers Hoppy lets him hide out at the Bar 20 Ranch. They trap the crooks and discover that the chief bad guy is the local banker Mr. Crandall.
