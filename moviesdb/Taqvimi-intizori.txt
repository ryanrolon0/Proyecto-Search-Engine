Taqvimi intizori

 A day in the life of a small village in the mountains, with all its difficulties, joy, amenities and beauties, from dawn to late at night. The echo of the collapse of the Soviet rule, civil war and the building of a new life reached these places where, in cold and harsh winter days, people warm their homes with the fire of kindness, hope and love.
