Volver la vista - der umgekehrte Blick

 VOLVER LA VISTA moves the viewer into the perspective of a foreigner. Mexicans who live in Austria and Austrians who spend their lives in Mexico through clichEs and yearnings - these emigrants create a picture of their countries, and through determining their location, attempt to their identity. They are accompanied by two cinematographers, who also go to a "foreign" place. Their views go along with the narrators and narratives into the respective, other country.
