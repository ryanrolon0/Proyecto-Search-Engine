The Non-Stop Kid

 The popular young Miss Wiggle has many upper-class suitors, but she prefers Harold to any of them. Her father, though, chases Harold away, because he is arranging for his daughter to marry Professor Noodle. When Harold learns this, he intercepts the Professor on his way to tea at the Wiggles' house, and he then impersonates the Professor.
