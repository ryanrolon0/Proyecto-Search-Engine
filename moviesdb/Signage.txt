 Lex, a forty-one year old man, struggles to maintain his marketability in today's gay world. Will his encounter with Jonathan, a young deaf man, at a local gay bar, help to relieve or merely reinforce his fear of growing older in this youth and beauty-obsessed culture? Much like they have for the better part of their adult lives, gay forty-something friends Lex and Gabe are primping and preening themselves in preparation for a night at the gay bar. They muse whether they are getting too old to act and dress the way they did when they were half their current age. At the bar, Lex meets twenty-something Jonathan, a man exactly half his age. Regardless, the two are attracted to each other. Lex's encounter with Jonathan makes Lex examine the stereotypical behavior inherent in most, but within Lex as a middle aged gay man.
