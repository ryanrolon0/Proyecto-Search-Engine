Trouble Down Under

 Written by Tony Findlay and Howard Jackson, "Trouble Down Under" is based on an original story by Findlay. Plot has peace reigning in the Australian Outback until a lost mob of African Meerkats causes tension with the local red and gray Kangaroo mob families. Their accidental arrival triggers chaos when a white wallaby rogue named Al Bino, returning from exile overseas, creates further confusion. Trouble, with a capital T, runs a muck as word spreads.
