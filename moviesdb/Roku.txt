Roku

 Hiromichi and his son race back to their village with a rare medicine that will save the lives of Hiromichi's wife and daughter. The peasants are pursued by the bandit Saizo and his two henchmen. Saizo is determined to steal the medicine, but his men are more interested in a girl they recently abducted. In an attempt to cut the men off, Saizo unwittingly chases the peasants into a forest haunted by the ghost of ?Blind Osumi? a girl slain by bandits many years earlier. The appearance of Osumi's ghost sparks a series of horrific encounters that spell madness or death for everyone in the haunted wood. But one traveler's secret past may provide the key to unlocking the mystery of the ghost's bloody wrath.
