Rachel's Daughters

 Seven women, breast cancer patients or survivors, take on the necessary task of asking, "Why?". They travel through the United States, interviewing a wide range of experts and researchers as to the possible causes of the leading killer of American women ages 35-54. Courageous questions and research methods ultimately point to assorted environmental toxins of the post-WWII era sources, electromagnetic fields, and atomic bomb testing.
