Save the Planet

 Esperanza, a quiet, withdrawn person, lives her life under the radar. She's like many of us, getting by with the limited resources and doing the best she can with what little she has. As a rare treat, she leaves her apartment with the intention to have a nice, quiet lunch; but destiny has other plans for her. Today, everyone will notice Esperanza.
