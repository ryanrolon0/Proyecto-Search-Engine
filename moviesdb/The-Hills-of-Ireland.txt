The Hills of Ireland

 This documentary/travelogue film features the color and character of the Irish people set against the background of their beautiful and picturesque country. Hollywood star Pat O'Brien narrates fondly as the cameras travel over the land to Killarney Lakes, Dublin, Belfast, Galway, Cork, Donegal and Sligo, and sights of the renowned Blarney Stone, St. Kevin's Bed, Benn Bullen and Aran Island. Appearances by Sean O'Kelly, Prime Minister Costello, Eamon De Valera, and the singing of Christopher Lynch, assisted by a 32-piece Symphony orchestra are among the highlights.
