Trance-Atlantik

 From the 16th to the 19th century millions of black Africans were sold into slavery and forcibly taken to Brazil. The Orishás, their gods, crossed the Atlantic with them. Life depends upon them. In a trance the Orishás become incarnate. Black Brazilians Geralda, Tanja and Roseli, initiates of CandomblE, the cult of Orishás, travel from Brazil to Benin, Africa, to a meeting with their most distant relatives and their shared gods. A journey to the source of their identity and their religion. Back to the roots. 'Trance-Atlantic' follows an arc between continents and links the two ends of the umbilical cord accompanied by the sound of drums and the circle dance of the Orishás, who are visible in the trance.
