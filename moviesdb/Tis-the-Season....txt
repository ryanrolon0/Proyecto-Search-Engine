Tis the Season...

 Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that tends to occur as the days grow shorter in the winter. It is believed that affected people react adversely to the decreasing amounts of sunlight and the colder temperatures. In severe instances, it can be associated with thoughts of suicide.
