Silly Seals

 In a North Pole classroom, Professor Seal is teaching th young seals all about fishing. One little seal would rather practice snowball-juggling and plays hookey, and gets into trouble with the teacher. But back in the classroom a hungry polar bear is waiting to make food out of the seals. The juggling seal does his act and the bear is so impressed that he decides to stay in school and learn to juggle.
