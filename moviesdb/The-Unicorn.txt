The Unicorn

 Rory moves into a flat where it's his job to look after the Unicorn that lives there. At a party Rory discovers the reason he is charged with the Unicorn's care is that it only responds to a virgin's touch. Feeling shamed he visits a brothel. Months pass and we meet his girlfriend - the attending nurse the night he was gored by the Unicorn, a result of him no longer being 'Innocent'. When Rory visits the flat he meets his replacement and catches a last glimpse of the Unicorn.
