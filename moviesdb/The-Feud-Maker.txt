The Feud Maker

 When Tex is brought in to fight in a range war between the cowmen and the nesters, he meets his old outlaw boss Lassiter. He learns Lassiter is behind the feud when Lassiter asks him to join up with his gang. Tex refuses and instead sets out to stop the feud but no one will believe him that Lassiter is responsible. 'Texas' Ryan's uncle, Hank Younger, sends for his nephew to help him in a range war involving the cattlemen and homesteading nesters. 'Texas' meets Rand Lassister, the leader of an outlaw gang in which 'Texas' was once a member, and learns that Lassister is the man behind the scheme to instigate a range war between the ranchers and the homesteaders. Lassister, using a different name, is now a respected member of the community, and 'Texas' Ryan faces several problems in trying to prove that Lassister/Landers is the man responsible for the feud.
