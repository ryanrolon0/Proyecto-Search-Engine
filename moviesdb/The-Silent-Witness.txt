The Silent Witness

 Danny, fourteen-year-old son of a police officer (killed in the line of duty) and his widowed mother, Mary, are close to Lt. Williams. The Lieutenant would like to marry Mary, who does not have any interest in marrying another police officer. Meanwhile, Gus Jordan, a third-rate wrestler, accidentally kills his girlfriend Lola. Danny witnesses this while on his paper route, and becomes Jordan's target which Williams must stop.
