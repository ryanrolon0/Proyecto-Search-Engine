Small Town Sheriff

 Farmer Al Falfa is in a bad mood thanks to the bumpy ride he is getting in his clunker of a car. A little water in the radiator seems to help, even though the water Al Falfa pumps is full of fish. Eventually, an enormous fish pops out and steals his car. Meanwhile, various animals are getting drunk down by the "Speakeasy Soda Fountain." It seems there's something more than soda in the drinks, which cause its imbibers to pass out, breathe smoke and flames, and worse. Al Falfa arrives at the speakeasy. After a brief misadventure with a blind pig, whose tail the farmer tries to use as a corkscrew, Al Falfa takes a very strong drink and floats up to the heavens. In space, he has strange encounters with weird creatures on various planets. More surprises are in store for everyone, including the identity of the title character.
