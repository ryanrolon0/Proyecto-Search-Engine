The Gospel of Lou

 Lou is a world class boxer, but he doesn't get the respect he deserves. He stutters violently unless he's starting sh_t and confronting people with his ideas. When a head injury robs him of his licence to box, Lou gets radical (he DEBUGS HIS BRAIN) in order to transform from violent, homophobic, stuttering shit-starter into an inspirational speaker.
