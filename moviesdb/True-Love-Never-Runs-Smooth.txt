True Love Never Runs Smooth

 Johnson's wife finds a letter in his coat from a dame with whom he has been flirting. The letter suggests that he meet her in a nearby cafE. Mrs. Johnson doesn't do a thing to him. She confronts him with his perfidy and proceeds to throw all of his wearing apparel out of the window. Johnson is in despair, and tears his hair and raves, but all to no purpose. Finally the bell rings, and, going to the door, Mrs. J. receives a letter for hubby, which, on being opened, advises him that he has inherited a fortune. Mrs. J. finally accepts the explanation made by her hubby, and on promising to be good in the future, she causes his clothes to return as if by magic, and she catches them as they enter the window. This is good.
