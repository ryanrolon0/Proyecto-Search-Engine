Show of Hands

 Jess is a solo mother and reluctant parking warden. Tom is a self-obsessed Greetings Cards salesman with an addiction to competitions who will do anything to win. Together they are just two of the competitors in a grueling endurance contest to win a car - whoever keeps their hand on it the longest wins. As the sleepless days wear by, what price will they pay for winning this competition and will it be worth more than the car itself? Show of Hands is a tale of desperation, determination - and love.
