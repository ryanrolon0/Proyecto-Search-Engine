Shati el gharam

 Adel, a rich young bachelor, steadfastly refuses his aunt's urging to marry her daughter Salwa, his cousin. He remains content with a long-term affair he has had with a dancer, Soheir. However, his life changes when he visits the city of Mersa Matrouh and meets Laila, a beautiful but penniless young woman with a lovely singing voice. He falls in love and marries her. However, Soheir and his scheming family aren't willing to give up easily on having his money for themselves.
