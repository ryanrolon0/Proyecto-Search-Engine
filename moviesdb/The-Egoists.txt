The Egoists

 The Egoists is an experimental film originally shot with a Fisher Price PXL 2000 toy video camera. A compilation of footage shot between 1993 and 2009 make up the visuals of the work, whilst a reading of the first chapter of a fantasy novel by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford provides a narrative stream.
