The Grand Horror

 After a mysterious darkness envelopes the entire world, horrifying creatures begin attacking the populace. One week later, a group of survivors manage to escape an attack and find their way into an abandoned movie theater. Oddly, the creatures seem to be afraid to come anywhere near the theater. Thinking themselves safe, the group of survivors are forced to confront something far deadlier then the flesh eating creatures outside. This theater is inhabited by a far greater evil, brought about by the darkness that covers the world.
