The Dirty Three

 The Dirty Three are the rough and ready jewels in the crown of Australian rock and roll history. Born from the need to put food on the table and spawned from the intensely collaborative local Australian music scene in the 80's and early 90's, the Dirty Three pioneered the instrumental rock and roll music scene in Australia with their cathartic, sometimes violent and always spellbinding brand of music. Within a few short years, they achieved local and international success and left Australian shores to take their Music to the world. To this day the band continues to tour the world and serve the music that they see as a real, living and breathing thing that chooses the Dirty Three's custodianship The documentary chases the bands history through extensive archival footage and interviews with international luminaries. The live concert on this DVD is also a testament to the Bands reach. Taiyo Films took some of Australia's finest Music Video Directors to Tokyo Japan, to film the Dirty Three playing live in Shibuya at the O-Nest venue. Collaborating with Tokyo based sound technician Satoru Fujii, a very special night in the history of the band was recorded for posterity. The Australian music video directors were also briefed to capture images of every day life on the streets in Tokyo which has been used to great effect. The concert sound post produced by Casey Rice and Mick Turner. This release is primarily about music, it's a story of 2 Melbourne blokes and a boy from Ballarat in Country Victoria, Australia, who have held fast to their primary objective through thick and thin, that being to serve music in the best way they can and not try to control it.
