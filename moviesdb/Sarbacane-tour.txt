Sarbacane tour

 Francis Cabrel and his band perform in concert at the Palais des Sports in Toulouse, France. The band includes Bernard Paganotti, formerly of Magma. The crowd particularly enjoys Cabrel's older songs, which include "Saïd et Mohamed", "L'encre de tes yeux", "Je pense encore à toi", "La dame de Haute Savoie", "C'Etait l'hiver", "Les chevaliers Cathares", "Je l'aime à mourir", and "Chauffard".
