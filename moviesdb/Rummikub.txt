 A tourist guide is obsessed with a legend about a woman condemned by her husband to wander on a Glacier for the rest of her life. Every time the guide tells this story, he believes he can see the woman wandering on the ice. One day, a young lady and her husband arrive to tour the Glacier. Once they arrive she starts feeling sick, and even more after she hears the story. The tourist guide recognizes her and will now do anything on his power to make the legend real.
