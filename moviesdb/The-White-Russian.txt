The White Russian

 When a bumbling private detective is hired to investigate the apparently planned murder of a mysterious woman, hilarity and violence follow. Will he be able to solve the case, or will a slick gangster, a paranoid hit-man, a jilted lover, or one of the other colorful characters get the better of him?
