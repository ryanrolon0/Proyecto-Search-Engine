Underage and Under the Influence

 The UK has one of the highest rates of underage binge drinking in Europe with children as young as eleven now drinking alcohol regularly. The London Programme follows emergency services as they deal with the consequences of underage binge drinking and follow a group of young people as they take to the streets on a Friday night.
