Snafu

 A 14-year-old boy lies about his age and enlists in the United State Marine Corps without his family's consent or knowledge. He is sent into battle, in the Pacific war-zone, and decorated, and spotted in a newsreel by his family. The family asks the War Department to discharge him and send him home. A complicated period of adjustment follows for both the boy, who is no longer a boy even at the age of 15, and his family. (S/N/A/F/U, as the title is displayed, was a World War II military slang term standing for...Situation normal, all f(rigged) up. When the title was used on a 1984 film, the meaning, and all the correct words were used. )
