Roomies

 Zack has just graduated college, has a girlfriend of seven years and has a well-paying job coming out of school. The only problems are he cannot stand his girlfriend and he hates the job he's taking. On top of that, his girlfriend finds out how much money he will be making and proposes to him. So it's up to his two roommates, Mike and Shirm, to make him realize to go after what he really wants dreams, Emily, who happens to be dating their fourth roommate, Rick.
