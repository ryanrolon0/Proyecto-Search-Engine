The September Issue

 The September 2007 issue of Vogue magazine weighed nearly five pounds, and was the single largest issue of a magazine ever published. With unprecedented access, this film tells the story of legendary Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour and her larger-than-life team of editors creating the issue and ruling the world of fashion. An impressive documentary following editor-in-chief Anna Wintour & her team as they struggle to write Vogue's largest and heaviest number of all times (840 pages and almost 5 pounds). The viewer observes the complicated process through which everyone goes through while working for a fashion magazine. Viewers can also admire Grace Coddington, a former model that became a creative director after a car accident, while she passionately helps the magazine evolve and even stand up to some of Anna Wintour's ideas.
