The Trap

 Kelly Wong, a thirty year old imaginative college professor, comes home to a trap that her very traditional mother sets for her. She is instantly pushed into a blind date she knows nothing about. William, her mother's version of a nice Chinese son-in-law, also knows nothing of this date. Confrontation ensues during this blind dinner for four.
