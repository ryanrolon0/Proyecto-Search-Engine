Saturday

 "Swingers" in New York city in real-time What would happen if you followed three college guys around New York City on a Saturday night with three cameras? What would happen if the first guy who brings a girl home gets his own Television reality show? I-Productions Inc. captured a 75 minute feature film showing you what did happen. No more will people head to Las Vegas for the ultimate night out on the town. This movie will switch the momentum back to the city that never sleeps, New York City. Buckle your seatbelt, drink a couple of Red Bull and Vodka's, and enjoy the rollercoaster ride through Manhattan's nightlife. Maybe you can learn a thing or two!
