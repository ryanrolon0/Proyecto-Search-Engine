Right Yaaa Wrong

 After bravely apprehending Boris (Aryan Vaid), Goa's Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ajay Sridhar (Sunny Deol), is gravely injured and hospitalized. He does recover, only to find that he can never walk again and must be confined to a wheelchair. He is subsequently discharged to the care of his wife, Anshita (Eesha Koppikar); brother, Sanjay; and school-going son, Yash. Frustrated by his confinement, he becomes edgy and short-tempered. After getting an Insurance Policy for 5 Crore Rupees he asks his wife and brother to plan his murder, get the money, and live a better life. Both reluctantly agree and follow his detailed plan. On the fateful day, however, Murphy's Law seemingly prevails, and everything goes awry.
