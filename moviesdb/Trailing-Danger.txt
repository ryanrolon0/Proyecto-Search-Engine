Trailing Danger

 Convicted killer Jim Holden is rescued from the sheriff by his gang, led by Mason and Riley. He is out to get the Hathaway Stage superintendent George Bannister, who was responsible for his conviction and learns the Bannister, his niece (Kay) and Hal Hathaway, son of the stage line owner, are on a cross-country stage. Johnny, a rancher, and Waco, local stage representative head for the stage to warn the passengers, including entertainer Paradise Flo and coffin salesman Pennypacker. Hal takes the stage into Holdin. Johnny and Waco rescue Hal and Bannister before the gang succeeds in hanging the pair. By a ruse, Johnny, Waco and Hal split up and capture the entire gang.
