Sylph

 Lucas is a young slacker who would rather sit on his couch and watch documentary films than experience the world first-hand. His room-mate Vince comes home and gives him hard time about it but Lucas barely pays him any attention. Lucas answers a knock at his door. Sylvia, a lively young woman, invites Lucas 'in' to the world. He decides to go with her. It's a beautiful day outside but is there more in the air than just fluffy white clouds? They discuss the world and their existence. Sylvia leads Lucas on a philosophical journey that just might change the way he lives.
