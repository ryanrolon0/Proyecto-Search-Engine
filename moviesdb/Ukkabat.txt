Ukkabat

 On the day when three distant planets all align in a straight line, a torrential downpour of meteorites cascades into the Earth¡¦s atmosphere. One meteor, too large to disintegrate completely, crashes into the middle of an ancient cemetery. A pregnant beggar is killed instantly, but not before giving birth to a boy. The boy is no ordinary child. Instead the vengeful supernatural being grows up to become a fearsome psychopathic serial killer whose murderous rampage claims entire villages. There must be someone who has similar supernatural powers equal to the paranormal bloodthirsty killer to fight and subdue him.
