Road Rash

 The original game that spawned a classic series. You are a biker who takes part in a series of illegal countryside races across the U.S.A. You always start at the back of the pack and your objective is of course to become Number 1. To achieve this goal you can either drive very well or play it dirty and knock your opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. But watch out, the others racers are no pansies either. By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. All the races take place on the regular road so watch out for the normal traffic and the cops. Whenever you're knocked of your bike or hit something you'll have to run back to your bike and loose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. Road Rash has arcade-like gameplay; it's definitely not a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, you can't play the game simultaneously, this was later added into the sequel.
