 It's the story of three men who meet some 30 years after World War 2 has ended. Two of them are now important politicians, the other one, Beretta, is a gas station attendant. The three go for a ride in the politicians'limousine, and start a conversation about the good old times of fascism, when Beretta was a personal secretary of the "duce", Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. But it's not only because they want to talk about the good times that the two politicians took Beretta with them...
