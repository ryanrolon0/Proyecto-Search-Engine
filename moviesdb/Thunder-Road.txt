Thunder Road

 The greatest thing about the Cub Scouts is the annual Pinewood Derby. While young Billy has visions of speed and beauty for his pinewood race car, his father becomes ridiculously obsessed with crossing the finish line first. A young boy struggles to hang on to a dream as his father hijacks his Cub Scout experience.
