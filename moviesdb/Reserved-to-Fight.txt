Reserved to Fight

 In May 2003, Fox Company of Marine Reserve Unit 2/23, returned home from active combat in Iraq. Reserved To Fight follows four Marines of Fox Company through three years of their postwar minefield of social and psychological reintegration into civilian life. The return to their communities proves as formidable a battle as the more literal firefights of previous months. Living among loved ones who don't yet understand them and how they have changed, contending with a media focused on the politics rather than the human experience of war, and suffering from a psychological disorder that is difficult to acknowledge, these young veterans grapple to find purpose and healing.
