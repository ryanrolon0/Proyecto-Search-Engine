The Passionate Pilgrim

 Filmed on location at Hever Castle in Kent. This short film comedy is set in medieval times and features the rivalry between Eric Morecambe's Lord and Tom Baker's Knight over the affections of the gorgeous Madeline Smith. There is very little dialogue between the characters as most of the dialogue is narrated by an unseen John Le Mesurier.
