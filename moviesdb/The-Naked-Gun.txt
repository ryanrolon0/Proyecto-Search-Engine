The Naked Gun

 A re-run of many of the gags from the original TV series 'Police Squad'. An Airplane type spoof, this time with the an incompetent lieutenant (Drebin) who always 'gets his man'. Visual gags come thick and fast, and it's impossible to catch them all with one viewing. The plot.. Queen Elizabeth II of England is coming to town, and Vincent Ludwig has plans to assassinate her using a brainwashed baseball player. Lieutenant Frank Drebin is a clumsy police detective of Police Squad, a division of the Los Angeles Police Department. Frank returns home to L.A from a vacation in Beirut, when his partner and best friend, Detective Nordberg is gunned down in a undercover operation. Frank's investigation into Nordberg's attempted murder leads Frank to become suspicious of well-respected businessman Vincent Ludwig and discovers Vincent Ludwig plans to brainwash a baseball player with mind control device, and assassinate Queen Elizabeth who is visiting L.A. on her American tour. Police Squad's own granite-jawed, rock-brained cop, Frank Drebin, bumbles across a mind-control scheme to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Detective Nordberg, Jane Spencer, a stuffed beaver, two baseball teams an odd assortment of others joining the wacko goings-on.
