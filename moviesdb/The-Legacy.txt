The Legacy

 THE LEGACY explores the hope, dignity, and joy that the pursuit of excellence engenders in a human being. It is a road map for understanding how hardship and alienation help us define our true calling in life. Journeying to 31 cities in 11 countries throughout the Western Hemisphere and Europe, THE LEGACY follows the lives of nine young musicians as they tour South America with The Youth Orchestra of the Americas (YOA), and then return to their hometowns. THE LEGACY includes live performances by the YOA and its internationally acclaimed guest soloists under the direction of three respected conductors, including Gustavo Dudamel (recently featured on "60 Minutes" and named Musical Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic), Carlos Prieto, and David Robert Coleman. Additionally, THE LEGACY features the stories of Ludwig Colombani - a destitute 9-year-old boy from Margarita Island who, as fate would have it, just happened to be sitting next to a violin on the day the film's crew accidentally met him - and Mr. David Arben, the former Associate Concert Master of the Philadelphia Orchestra and a world-renowned violin soloist. David is survivor #14088 of the Flossenbürg concentration camp in Flossenbürg, Germany, and he tells the incredible story of how music literally saved his life in THE LEGACY.
