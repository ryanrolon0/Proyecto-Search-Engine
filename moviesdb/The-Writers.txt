The Writers

 A story of sexual deviance and forbidden romance between two tortured men - who like to act out by torturing others. After Andrew (Todd Michael Smith), a married writer, is kidnapped by Eddy (Steven Michael McKenzie), a seductive and surprisingly forthcoming serial killer, he is compelled to write about him and the two begin a strange sexual relationship. The actors hold absolutely nothing back from the camera. McKenzie and Smith offer full-frontal nudity and graphic scenes of unsimulated sex - with some sinister kink and a little bloodshed thrown in for good, horrific measure (the blood is fake, of course)! Writer/director Todd Michael Smith weaves a tale of intense violence mixed with intense love. When novelist Andrew Sarris goes out to pick up the local newspapers to find an idea for his next novel, he instead comes face to face with a serial killer known only as Eddy. After Eddy kidnaps Andrew, a deal is struck. Andrew will write his next novel about Eddy. Writer/director Todd Michael Smith weaves a tale of intense violence mixed with intense love.
