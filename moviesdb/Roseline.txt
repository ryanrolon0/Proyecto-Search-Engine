Roseline

 The story of Roseline. In northern Uganda the war has been raging for more than 21 years. But for Roseline the war is not only in her world; it's in her body. Since the day she was born she has been infected with HIV/AIDS. In Uganda, currently over a million people are infected with the disease. In 2006 alone, AIDS killed more than 91,000 Ugandans. It's a disease that took the lives of Roseline's parents, and it threatens to take hers. But when you meet Roseline, you do not meet a victim. You do not meet a child defined by illness. Rather, you meet the infectious laughter and carefree singing of a hopeful girl. This is a story of joy found in the midst of war. This is Roseline's story.
