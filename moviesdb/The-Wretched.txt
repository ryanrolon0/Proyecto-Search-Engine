The Wretched

 Buried beneath 150 years of deception, a heart of darkness still beats. It waits for the next listener to its tale. When seven agronomy students arrive on an abandoned farm to conduct soil research, they rouse a curse long-forgotten. The truth filters into their subconscious as the students unravel secrets long-buried and left for dead. As the curse calls louder and louder, they must unlock the puzzle or fall victim to the wretched souls damned by the land's false history.
