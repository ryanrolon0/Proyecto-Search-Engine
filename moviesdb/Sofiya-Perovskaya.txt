Sofiya Perovskaya

 Sofya Perovskaya was a member of 'Narodnaya volya', a terrorist group that killed Czar Aleksander II. The leader of this group was Vladimir Lenin's big brother Alexander Ulyanov. These terrorists assassinated the Czar with a bomb. In 1967 (The 50th Anniversary of the Communist Revolution) Soviet propaganda glorified the assassins in this film.
