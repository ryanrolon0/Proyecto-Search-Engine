The Woods Have Eyes

 When a group of young campers wander into the backwoods of upstate New York to see if Cappy's Cabin--a place they think exists only in urban legend--is real, they find themselves in a twisted game of predator and prey as night begins to fall. All they have to do is survive until dawn, but Cappy is very, very real, and night has only just begun... It all starts out a quiet summer day at a campground in Upstate New York. Families have gathered in the sullen isolation to enjoy the lazy summer days. Carmine, the oldest camper in the group, leads this year's adventure into the woods. A group of teens follow. This summer is not the same as the last as the group decides to cross the forbidden river that leads off camp property. Joe, the local among the group, is determined to make a prank of the outing and take the vulnerable city kids to the infamous Cappy's cabin. Cappy, a campfire tale of a backwoods hunter is more than legend. The children come upon a clearing in the woods. It is the cabin. Joe peers in through a dirty window, nothing. He looks further into the deepness of the dark room. A dead girl lies outstretched on the floor as Clem, one of Cappy's sons cries over her body. The chase begins. If the children want to survive this summer in the woods, they will need to come up with a plan.
