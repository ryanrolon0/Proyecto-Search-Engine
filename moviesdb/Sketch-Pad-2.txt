Sketch Pad 2

 Some of the best comedy troupes from around the world assemble on one stage for this hilarious and at times, down right shocking comedy special. Members from seven renowned sketch troupes-including Acme Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings, Bravo Company, Improv Asylum, Smack The Pony, Big Guy Lil' Mike, Some Kind of Cult and special musical guest L. Witherspoon and Chucky -- perform individual scripted shorts before a live audience. Each sketch appears to trump the next with outrageous adult themes all the way to the climatic finish.
