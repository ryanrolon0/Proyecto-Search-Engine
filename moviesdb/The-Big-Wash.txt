The Big Wash

 Goofy is a circus attendant who is friends with Dolores the elephant. Today is his day to bathe Dolores but Dolores is not intent on being bathed and tries desparately to avoid Goofy even disguising herself as a clown at one point (which actually fools Goofy for a moment). Even when Goofy captures her, he still has difficulties with the bath job particularly when Dolores begins to start sneezing. Goofy is the elephant keeper for a circus, and it's time to give Dolores the elephant a bath, whether she wants it or not. Dolores dresses as a clown and sneaks past Goofy; she makes herself rectangular and hides behind a cart; she moves Goofy's ladder as he tries to climb her. Finally, Goofy gets Dolores soaped up, only to have her suffer from a sneezing fit.
