Underground Poets Railroad

 "Underground Poets Railroad" is equal parts concert film of performances at universities, churches, fire stations and national monuments across the country; road trip documentary; and, ultimately, a tribute to the 12 black firefighters who gave their lives on September 11. Six of the nations brightest spoken word artists came together in New Orleans on September 2, to begin a life transforming journey to New York City for the memorial anniversary of September 11.
