The Bard

 Robert Burns, Scotland's greatest poet and writer of traditional Scottish folk songs. His works are known and loved all over the world. Voyage back to a time when words were spoken with unrivaled emotion. When life was sung to a tune of song, dance, and haggis. Live and breathe the poetry, desire, and romance with Highland Mary, Clarinda, and Bonnie Jean. From Alloway to Dumfries, from Gavin Hamilton to Mrs. Dunlop, journey through the life of an indulgent husband, an adoring father, and Caledonia's favorite son.
