Slim Mints

 What goes around comes around...and around, and around, when four unsuspecting strangers (a hungry cop, an English thief, an embittered store clerk, and a bratty Girl Sprout) converge because of a single box of Slim Mints cookies and the power of Karma in this bizarre, quirky, and absurdly coincidental short comedy. Are YOU familiar with the concept of Karma?
