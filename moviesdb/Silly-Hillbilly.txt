Silly Hillbilly

 Popeye's traveling department store comes to hillbilly country. He gets upset as Bluto, mistaking a radiator for an accordion, cuckoo clocks for a shooting gallery, and a girdle for a hammock, does violence to his store. But Olive arrives, looking for a makeover, and that distracts Popeye a while. Bluto sees the "new" Olive and gets jealous, and the feud is on.
