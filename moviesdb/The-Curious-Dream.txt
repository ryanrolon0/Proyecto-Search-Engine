The Curious Dream

 A 2D crowned elephant wakes up on a piece of paper in the middle of a surreal landscape. He literally pulls himself together and takes his first steps into life. Meanwhile, the world around him continues to build. The moon rises, and the elephant now has wings. He takes off and flies into the moonlight.
