The City

 The City presents a disrupted day in the life of Honey and Stairwell. Awakened by an unusual sound, Stairwell arises to explore only to end up sprawled on their apartment's bedroom floor, felled by a falling brick. What should Honey do about the uncharacteristically inexpressive Stairwell? Will he revive? Will he remember what happened? Will he be hungry? Will he gain insights to life in Brooklyn, where The City, written by Jonathan Rapp, was primarily shot?
