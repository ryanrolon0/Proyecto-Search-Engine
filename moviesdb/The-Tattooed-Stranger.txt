The Tattooed Stranger

 The body of an unknown woman turns up in a stolen car abandoned in a New York park, and the only clue the detectives on the case have to work from is the tattoo on her arm, and the fact that someone tried to deface the corpse to remove the evidence. From this slender trail, and that of a single stem of grass discovered in the car, they gradually trace back first the victim and then her killer, in a case that's all science and legwork, and no magic inspiration. Produced, directed and written by the makers of RKO's "This is America" series of shorts, shot in a semi-documentary style on location in New York City the only clue is a small tattoo of the emblem of the United States Marine Corps. The police learn that she was a bigamist who defrauded the U. S. Government of the insurance checks of her WWII service men'husbands.' A young detective, Tobin, pieces together small bits of growing evidence and finally shoots it out with the killer in storage yard of a tombstone cutter. A botanist, Mary Marhan, helps with the multi-forensics investigation.
