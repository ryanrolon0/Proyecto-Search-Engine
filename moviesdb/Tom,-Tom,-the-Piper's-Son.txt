Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son

 Based loosely on the nursery rhyme refreshments, entertainment, and other activities. As the rest of the crowd is watching one of the acts, Tom steals a pig and runs off. He tries to hide, but he is chased by the crowd, and the pig also proves difficult to control. But Tom has some tricks up his sleeve that might give him a chance to escape.
