Regent Street

 Regent Street is a romantic tale, a simple boy-meets-girl story with a twist. Deia is a fashion student at Central St Martins. Gus is a bottle washer at a West End brasserie. They're foreigners, outsiders, 'exotics' making their way in London. They are drawn to the same location and they have the same purpose in mind. When neither of their dates shows up, they are left in the glare of the Piccadilly Lights. Based on a true story.
