Venga a fare il soldato da noi

 In the '70s, when in Italy was compulsory for all the young men to serve under the army, Nicoletta Bianchi, a girl, is enlisted. She decided not to clarify she couldn't serve being a woman because she wants to check on her boy-friend Fabrizio, whom she believes to be a womanizer, that is serving under the army. This is not the only strange situation in the barracks. In fact private Proietti is hiding his little son because the mother was arrested for smuggling, sergeant La Rosa and Samperi had just lost the code for the encrypted messages and so invent all the orders coming from high command. Could the regiment survive to the incoming general maneuver?
