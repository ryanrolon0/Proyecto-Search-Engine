Surfing with the Enemy

 SURFING WITH THE ENEMY is the story of a group of surfers from Havana struggling to establish a niche for their sport in Cuba's restrictive society. Guided by Eduardo Valdes, founder of the Havana Surf Association, two filmmakers from Venice Beach, California, travel across the island to the wave-rich but ill-famed Guantanamo province, home to the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay. Chasing waves along this controversial coast, they discover a forbidden paradise just miles from their own border, and learn what it means to be a surfer and a citizen of modern-day Cuba.
