The Church

 On the surface, Pastor Ian Gallagher seems to have it all - a loving wife, family and a church that adores him. But not all as it seems...the safe life he's known is about to fracture. His faith will be tested as never before as he grapples with questions about life, death, life beyond and the fate of his family. The Church depends on whether or not he passes that test.
