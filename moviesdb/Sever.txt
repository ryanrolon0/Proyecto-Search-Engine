 On a cold and foggy morning, the ocean delivers a killer to a small island off the coast of Massachusetts. His arrival is seen only by a young girl trapped inside of a cage- a girl who will never be allowed to divulge the secrets of the man who has imprisoned her. The man calls himself Patrick, an escaped schizophrenic patient who sets up camp, moving into a young woman's home. Unbeknownst to her, Patrick begins twisting her reality, making her think she's living with demons and committing heinous crimes. For him it's the ultimate rush.
