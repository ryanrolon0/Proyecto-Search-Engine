Swap Meet

 A nationwide retail center (Big Box) is about to swallow up one of Los Angeles' sweetest morsels, South Central's Slauson Swap Meet. The movie shows us how the Meet's myriad denizens, Terrence, and his sidekick Dwayne put aside their jealousies to confront the challenge of saving the Swap Meet. In the process several slackers find love with Chanel, Katrina, happiness, and a sense of self in the journey. It's filled with eclectic and hilarious characters who share their stories, jokes, and lives with us.
