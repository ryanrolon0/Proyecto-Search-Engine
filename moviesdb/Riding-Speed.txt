Riding Speed

 Looking for smugglers along the border, Steve takes a job on Vale's ranch. Vale's foreman Derkey is behind the smuggling and when he learns Steve is from the Border Patrol, he knocks out Vale, robs him, and sets his house afire, and flees. Meanwhile Steve, trying to rescue Vale's daughter, is trapped in a ravine. Steve ('Jay Wilsey' (qv))a mysterious saves Helen Vale ('Joile Benet' (qv)) from a car crash and is rebuked for his trouble. The next day, Helen discovers that her father, John Vale ('Lafe McKee' (qv) has given the Stranger a job on their ranch. The government advises Vail that aliens are being smuggled across the Mexican border on his property. Bill Derkey ('Bud Osborne (I)' (qv)), the Vail ranch foreman, sets out to cast suspicion on the Strange as being a member of the smuggling operation, in order to cover up his own role as leader of the band smuggling Chinese across the border. Helen rebukes the stranger for once again saving her life, and he spanks her. Helen is now in love with the spanking stranger. The Stranger, actually, a Border Patrolman, rounds up most of the gang, but Derkey is escaping, and carrying Helen along as his hostage.
