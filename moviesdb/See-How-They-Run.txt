See How They Run

 Set in the North Lake Tahoe area of Northern California, our protagonist (Kevin) wakes up to find himself in bed with a dead woman (Jessie). He convinces his best friend (Ben) to help him find out the truth surrounding her death, but before they find out anything, a blackmail artist (Sean) contacts them with intricate details about the murder. Sean threatens to leak the information to the police unless he's paid to keep his mouth shut. Kevin faces a choice not have committed...or face his own shadowy past and finally tell the truth.
