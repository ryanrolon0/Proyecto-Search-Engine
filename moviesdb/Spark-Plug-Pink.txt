Spark Plug Pink

 The Pink Panther wants to mow his lawn, but his mower needs a new spark plug. However, the new plug falls from his hands, and it's found by a vicious watchdog who thinks it's a bone. The panther tries to get the plug back first by trying stilt walking, a balloon kit and a rope to walk on, then by digging himself under the garden and finally posing as a bone inspector.
