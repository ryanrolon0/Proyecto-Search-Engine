The Family Man

 Dr. Patrick Stowe runs a private fertility clinic that has recently celebrated its 2000th live birth. His business is successful and he is passionate about helping his patients. His home life is less than successful, however. Driven by work, he seems to care more about his patients than his own family. His wife has left him and his two teenage children are on the verge of giving up hope that he will ever be a real dad to them. In the world of the fertility, many couples are desperate to have a child. It puts a strain on their relationships and forces many to compromise their beliefs in order to attain their goal. Some will pay any amount and make any sacrifice to have a child.
