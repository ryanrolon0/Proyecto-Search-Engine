Seeing

 Seeing follows the character of Bailie Crenshaw, a part time sociology professor. She spends her down time on the road coming to terms with her clairvoyant abilities, sometimes flashing back on how they wreaked havoc on her childhood, and coming to terms with the responsibilities she has in her adulthood as a person who can see things through other people's eyes.
