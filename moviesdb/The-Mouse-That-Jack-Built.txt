The Mouse That Jack Built

 In this spoof of "The Jack Benny Program", a mouse with Jack Benny's personality and poor violin playing ability lives, along with a mouse version of Benny's valet, Rochester, in a hole in a wall of Jack Benny's own home. Jack the rodent takes a mouse version of Mary Livingstone out to dinner, and the two unwittingly walk right into the disguised mouth of an orange cat!
