The Glass Box

 'The Glass Box,' is a short fictional film based on the lives of two young women in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Claudia is a twenty-three year old North American who has reluctantly come to Asia with her boyfriend to teach English. Yin-May, also twenty-three, was born and raised in Taiwan by her father in a fishing community on the island of Chijin, then moves to the city to work in a Betel nut stand. These increasingly rare neon trimmed glass aquariums are controversial and unique to Taiwan. 'The Glass Box' is a genuine story comparing and contrasting two people from different cultures who form an unlikely bond during their search for direction under unusual circumstances, in a unique urban setting.
