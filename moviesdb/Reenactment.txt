A film about a modern day filmcrew, making a film about a 1930's filmcrew, making a film set in the 17th century. Jacob De Elsworth is your average arrogant, artsy-fartsy director. He is in the midst of creating his self-proclaimed masterpiece, the greatest film ever made, in which he intertwines stories and time periods to create grand metaphors and tell his epic love story. In his film eternal love and betrayal are big themes, themes that are mirrored in his own life. Jacob is having affairs with several of his female coworkers and when they, during filming, find out about each other, hell obviously breaks loose. His trusted crew slowly turns against the overly demanding director and starts to ruin takes and rewrite his precious words. Jacob is ultimately left alone, abandoned by his whole crew and ironically, what would have been his epic story about love, turns out to be quite the opposite.
