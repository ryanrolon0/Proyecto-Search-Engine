The Dragon Wall

 Four brothers are expelled from the comfy confines of their climate-controlled bedroom, forced outside with nothing else to entertain themselves than their own imaginations - and the old man waiting for them at the edge of their backyard. When the curmudgeon informs the boys they are needed deep within the forest, they decide to follow him to see what could possibly need their assistance. Soon, the brothers find themselves alone, the first and only line of defense, at the crumbling and ineffective Dragon Wall.
