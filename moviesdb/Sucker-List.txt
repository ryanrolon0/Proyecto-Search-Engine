Sucker List

 Mr. Brown and his racketeer buddies, calling their company "Best Selections", come up with a scheme to bilk those already seemingly desperate for money of what little they have. The scheme has two main components it look like they've predicted the winners, and they, with a list of bank loan applicants in hand, telephone these people telling them of a sure bet. Seeing after the fact in the racing forms that the sure bet did in fact win the races, these loan applicants, desperate for money, will then go to the Best Selections office to make a subsequent bet through their bookies, who in reality are fakes. Mr. Brown's associates give them a name of a horse certain to lose, and the bet is made with the fake bookie. One of those targeted is Bill Allen, who can't afford the medical bills racking up for his pregnant wife, Mary Allen. Another victim is Charles Adams, a mechanic who just wants to make a little money. Charles' unfortunate situation may be what the police need to capture Brown and his gang. The subject of this Crime Does Not Pay series entry is fraudulent racetrack touts. One method they use is distributing phony tip sheets of yesterday's winners at a local track. They also "accidentally" call people who are deep in debt and leave a false tip, enticing them to make wagers they can't win.
