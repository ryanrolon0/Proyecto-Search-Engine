 An exhausted Charlie returns from work hoping to get some rest. However, Bessie informs him that their children, Junior and Suzy, have become school cheerleaders who (rather noisily) practice their routines at home. Charlie is displeased by this (he loses more than one newspaper to their antics) and tries to stop practice but fails constantly. Examples baton out the window but it boomerangs back and hits him in the face; he steals Junior's megaphone and is criticized by Bessie who now believes him to be the source of the noise.
