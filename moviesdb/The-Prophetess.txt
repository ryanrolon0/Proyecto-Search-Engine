The Prophetess

 Dahia al-Kahina, a Berber Queen, directed the most determined resistance to the seventh century Arab invasions of North Africa. About 690, al-Kahina, whose name means the 'priestess' or the 'prophetess,' assumed personal command of the African forces, and under her aggressive leadership, the Arabs were forced to retreat. The Kahina continued the resistence until her defeat by an overwhelming Arab force in Tunisia in 705 AD.
