Solti's Bartók in Budapest

 Georg Solti's historic last tour with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was this first appearance in Hungary with the orchestra he had conducted for over twenty years and his choice of an all-Bartók program for this return to his newly-free homeland, a trivute to the composer who was his teacher and mentor. The repertoire includes "Dance Suite". "Concerto for Orchestra" and "Piano Concerto No.3" with soloist Andras Schiff. Solti introduces each piece.
