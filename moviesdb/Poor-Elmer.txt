Poor Elmer

 This is not a "Scrappy" cartoon - The staff at a large big-city hospital is all bothered and nervously awaiting the arrival of a patient, named Elmer, and the doctors and nurses are busily preparing for a major operation. Finally, a woman arrives in a large town-car, with a chauffeur, and she is followed by attendants carrying the patient on a stretcher...Elmer the Goldfish.
