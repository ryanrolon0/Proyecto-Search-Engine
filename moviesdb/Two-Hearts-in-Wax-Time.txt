Two Hearts in Wax Time

 Two window dressers in a department-store basement tease Joe the drunk janitor about the mannequins being alive. Later, at 2 a tux and clocks out. On the street, he passes the store windows and the mannequins come to life, putting on a song and dance revue for him. He encourages the women in one window to visit the men in the next. Two mannequins pair up and sing a duet with ice cream cones, a railroad porter, and dancing couples. The spooning couple then joins a window of campers, singing "Let us live in beautiful illusion." Then, the lovers stumble into a window of villains, including Joe's doppelganger. Is the couple in danger? What will Joe do? After being told a tall tale by two Department store window dressers, Joe the constantly inebriated janitor believes the mannequins come to life. A song and dance show follows, with the two principal mannequins visiting various tableau's with monsters and villains. It all comes to an end however when a passing policeman sees what Joe is up to.
