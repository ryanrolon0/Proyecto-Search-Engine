Towncraft

 Towncraft looks at the importance of local scenes in a changing music world and the exciting music that emerges from smaller cities across the country when communities come together. Much like in Austin, Seattle, Athens and Chapel Hill, an underground-Rock scene emerged in Little Rock in the late 80s and has served as a vibrant center of the city's culture ever since. Unlike other towns, Little Rock's scene was composed almost entirely of kids. 14-18 year-olds were booking their own shows, starting record labels, opening record stores and playing with large national acts. The film focuses on the roots of the Little Rock scene, how it changed the lives of those involved, the enormous DIY ethos that has shaped the scene for the past 20 years and how the scene continues to thrive as pioneers hit their mid-30s.
