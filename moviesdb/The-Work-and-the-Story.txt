The Work and the Story

 It is July, 2000 Richard Dutcher, the man who pioneered "Mormon Cinema" with his film "God's Army" is MISSING and PRESUMED DEAD!! Three amateur Mormon Filmmakers individually set out to make their first feature-length films to take Dutcher's place as the next "Mormon Spielberg". Who will win? Who will lose? Who will find Richard? And does EVERYONE WANT RICHARD FOUND!!? These questions and many laughs are sure to be found in the movie "THE WORK and THE STORY" COMING SPRING 2003.
