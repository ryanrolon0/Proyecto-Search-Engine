The Reel Monkey

 "The Reel Monkey" is a short film set in the wilds of Africa. A frustrated documentary filmmaker is hot and bothered while waiting for two, bored chimpanzees to do something so he can finally get something on film. Frustrated by the chimp's lackluster behavior, he tries to relax with a Coca-Cola and notices the chimps perk up when he cracks a bottle open. Using the Coca-Cola as bait, he finally gets the chimps to perform for the camera, but he loses control of the situation when the chimps steal the bottle from him. He tries, unsuccessfully, to get his refreshing beverage back. We realize the animals have the upper hand when we see one of the chimps behind his camera, filming his foolish behavior.
