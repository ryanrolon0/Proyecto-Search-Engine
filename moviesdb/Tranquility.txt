Tranquility

 JIMMY KOVAC is a line cook in a Los Angeles restaurant. Jimmy fights with his boss, drinks beer, watches TV, and occasionally sleeps with MONICA, a supermarket checkout girl. But when he meets KATE, a New York actress in town for pilot season, Jimmy's life changes. Educated and privileged, it seems that Kate would have little interest in Jimmy, but as she spends more time with him, she discovers that Jimmy's life is not as simple as it seems. After a Thanksgiving trip to the war zone that is Jimmy's childhood home, Kate invites him to spend Christmas at her family's ski chalet in Colorado. For once, Jimmy finds himself in the company of a loving family who couldn't be more different from his own welcome him with open arms. Over time, Kate realizes that Jimmy has had triumphs and failures that he rarely mentions, but seems intent on protecting himself from further disappointment by opting out of life entirely. Kate asks him to move to New York with her, and Jimmy agrees to go. But a final visit from Monica on the eve of his departure leaves Jimmy facing a hard fact out of a bigger issue that he doesn't want to face.
