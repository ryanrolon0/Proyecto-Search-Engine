Scrapper

 As the global war on terror rages in Afghanistan and Iraq, a defiant group of scrappers eke out a living by infiltrating the live impact areas of a US military bombing range near the US/Mexico border to scavenge aluminum, brass and copper debris from exploded and unexploded ordnance. Dodging fighter jets, attack helicopters, Marines artillery units, Navy Seals, Border Patrol, ICE and Sheriffs agents, these survivalists are driven by adrenaline, crystal meth and wild-west grit to load up on military scrap without breaking down or blowing up in the merciless terrain. Scrappers is a journey into the feast or famine in the bizarest of free-enterprise zones where the welfare and warfare states bitterly collide.
