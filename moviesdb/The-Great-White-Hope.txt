The Great White Hope

 Jack Jefferson (James Earl Jones) as a boxer, dealing with the racism and hatred of early-20th century white America. He is not only the first black heavyweight contender; he is also in love with a white woman. Jefferson must not only deal with the hatred of whites, he must also deal with the ostracism of some members of the black community who feel he has sold out.
