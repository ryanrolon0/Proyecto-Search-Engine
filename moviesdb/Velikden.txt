 The film presents an old rare custom in the Easter night. At midnight worshipers go to the cemetery and put ritual breads and colors eggs on the graves to pay their respects to the dead. The colored Easter eggs are connected with pre-Christian practices, with the ancient worship of light, with the cult to dead and the beliefs about the origin of the Universe in the Bulgarian folklore.
