The Prams

 'Attacked' by a single pram whilst walking to work one morning, career focused Melanie suddenly finds herself in the centre of a frightening pram epidemic that has hit inner city Brisbane (Australia). Taking refuge in a nearby cafe, Melanie's safety becomes jeopardised and she is soon forced to flee for her life. The Prams is a black comedy with references to Hitchcock's The Birds.
