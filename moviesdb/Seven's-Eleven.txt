Seven's Eleven

 The perfect crime. Frankie is about 10, angelic looking and always thinking. At school, he runs blackjack games for candy. He and his close friend Noodle get a lot of detention. The two of them have planned to steal all the candy from the neighborhood Seven-Eleven, run by the cranky Stinger. He recruits several young friends. To pull it off, they must get someone in the locked office, distract Stinger several times, get him out of the store briefly, load all the candy quickly, get it away from the neighborhood, and leave no evidence. Impossible. Can Frankie, Noodle, and their gang pull it off?
