The Bop-a-Lots

 A developmental DVD for children ages 0-5 years. Created by parents in cooperation with educators, the DVD is designed to help children learn 'how' to think, not 'what' to think, by developing cognitive productive thinking skills. With playful dance and joyful world music beats, the three charming computer animated characters, lead your child on a journey of discovery where they learn that there are many ways to look at the same thing.
