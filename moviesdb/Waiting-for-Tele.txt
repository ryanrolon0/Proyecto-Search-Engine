Waiting for Tele

 Waiting for Tele is a singular film experience. A home movie, which appropriates and criticizes the mass media in order to look at Brazilian culture, our football and ourselves; a subjective look, almost from the point of view of the ball, for the game in the streets and the professional football. One of the particularities of this film is that, conceived and filmed in the early 90s, was assembled over almost 20 years. A documentary of the time.
