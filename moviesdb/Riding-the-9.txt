Riding the 9

 In 1985, the Number 9 bus of the City Line Transportation System slammed into the North Highway Bus Stop killing six people. The stop was abandoned and the Number 9 was decommissioned. Fifteen years later, on the anniversary of the wreck, the bus has been re-opened along with the original route. Four strangers, each dealing with a traumatic vent from their past, meet on the bus after a long day. Their tired and ready for home. But sometimes the way home is the longest trip of all.
