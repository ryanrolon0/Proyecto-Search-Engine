To Speak

 Based on a true story... Ratana is a young Cambodian girl, living a tenuous existence in an impoverished rural village. Despite the suffocating pessimism of her fellow villagers, she dreams of a better life, and of building a new and permanent home for her family. But a better future seems impossible, until a local development agency suggests a radical plan. The other villagers think that Ratana is crazy to trust the outsiders, but she seizes the opportunity and sets herself on a collision course with her family, the village and even Mother Nature herself. To succeed, Ratana will need to rise above the grind of daily survival and also grapple with the terrible legacy of the Khmer Rouge and the Killing Fields.
