Pure Evil

 PURE EVIL is a darkly comic, half hour comedy television series centering on Frank Henderson. Frank is a suburban family man who also happens to be the Antichrist. Frank is repelled by the role he was born to and would love nothing more than to continue his normal, peaceful existence. But that's not so easy when your father is Satan. With the backdrop of the looming apocalypse, PURE EVIL places Frank in the eye of the storm where he struggles to deny the dark impulses that haunt him, avoid his overbearing father, hide the truth about his identity from everyone - including his own wife, and brace himself for the possibility that his children have inherited his satanic genes and could turn evil at any moment.
