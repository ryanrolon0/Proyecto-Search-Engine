The Big Break

 The casting couch isn't as comfy as one might think. Especially when the producer you intended to seduce has a gun and thinks you're trying to rob the place. On the other hand, killing a deadbeat producer over bad debts he owes your boss isn't quite as easy when in his place sits a beautiful and bemused starlet. Coincidence yields confusion and comedy when the actress realizes the hitman may have acting ambitions of his own.
