Solicitor

 Star attorney Zak Spears, idolized by the firm's hot, new lawyer, Bo Summers, by chance happens upon two cleaning-men having sex in his office. Not surprisingly, he's shocked. But quite surprisingly, he finds it erotic. And thus begins his odyssey into the world of man-to-man sex. Climaxing in a sexual odyssey through the pants of Bo Summers. And a change of heart that leads to a change of life and a change of career. Solicitor, you'll want him on your side. In briefs.
