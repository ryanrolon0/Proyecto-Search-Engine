Silent Crossroads

 Very Coen brothers-esque noir film set in the mid-1960s in rural America. The lives of an inquisitive and sensitive Waitress and a heavily armed and wounded Bag Man -- two lonely souls who seem to know just what the other needs -- are forever changed when their paths cross at The Kozy Cafe. Alexandra Smothers plays a healing soul who takes in the foreboding stranger, played by Dalin Christiansen. Joe Osborn's innovative directing style and cinematography ignites their passion.
