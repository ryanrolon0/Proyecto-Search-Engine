Streets of New York

 New York City was once the crime capital of America, accounting for nearly 10% of murders in the US. The Bronx burned, the streets were awash in drugs, and the subways were so dangerous they created the most infamous vigilante of the last 50 years, Bernie Goetz. Today, New York is the safest big city in the country. 'Streets of New York' explores the rise and fall of crime in Gotham since 1970 through archival television footage and a series of interivews with convicts, drug dealers, robbers and gang members, (mostly reformed.)
