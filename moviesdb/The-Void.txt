The Void

 A boy is suffering. Then he heard a voice from inside him say, 'The reason why you are suffering is because you think about only yourself. Why don't you pray for the happiness of others? This is the only way to end the misery you feel and it is the seed of happiness.' Nothing but the boy's own heart can save him from the suffering and loneliness of modern society. You can appreciate and understand the fundamental Buddhist teaching of 'The law of cause and effect' through this poetic film.
