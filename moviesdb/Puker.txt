Puker

 In the 1980s, the Washington D.C. skate scene was dominated by local rebels with colorful names and hard core skill. They fled District streets for the Utopian vert ramps of rural Virginia and found fame in their corner of the world. One such rebel achieved close to perfection, immortalized in the minds of the few who witnessed him. But, just as suddenly as he rose to the peak of his skating career, he disappeared. Twenty years later, he returns. This is his story...the story of Puker.
