Running Out of Angels

 As his life unravels, Paul Bradley delves into the not-so-distant past to uncover how he transformed from an angsty, passionate young punk into a morally bankrupt Hollywood screenwriter. Paul must look back to discover how the chance meeting of a middle-aged drug-dealing preacher, a hedonistic fashion agent and five hundred thousand dollars in cash revealed the deep corners of human relationships and family secrets. Set against the Gothic beauty of Savannah, Georgia and the nostalgia of an impending Millennium, RUNNING OUT OF ANGELS is the story of how a single night became the rest of Paul's life.
