The Darkness We Know

 Daniel was like other children of his age. He loved playing outdoors and going for boat trips with his family. Then tragedy struck. The baffled medical community watched helplessly, as the once vibrant boy succumbed to this strange illness. After years of tests, uncertainties, hope and despair, the parents were told that Daniel suffered from a rare disease of Photosensitive Epilepsy. It was a huge blow for the whole family. Their whole world was turned upside down. Abandoned by everyone and shrouded in darkness, the whole family had to re-invent itself, its routines and its way of life. Yet this poignant story will not focus on loss, misery and sadness. It is a triumphant take on one family, who chose to live life to full.
