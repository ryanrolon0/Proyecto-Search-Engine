Seminoles, Alligators, and Football Players

 The history of the football rivalry between Florida State University (Seminoles) and the University of Florida (Gators) is revealed and elaborated on as fans of Florida State express themselves in a wild and vivid celebration of school spirit. This is thirty minutes of Deep South opinions, satire, parody and social commentary packed with fast paced interviews, t.v. preaching, alligator wrestling, fight songs, blood hounds and chitlin eating.
