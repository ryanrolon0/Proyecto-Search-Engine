Sister Patchouli

 A young woman from the eclectic community of Fairfield, Iowa has always believed that she failed to live up to her parents lofty goals for her life, to be a "blessing to the world." Now in her late 20's and working as a clerk in a local gift shop, she believes her life is a failure. But is it? A young woman from Fairfield, Iowa named Margaret was raised by her parents to be a blessing to the world - either as a nun or as a peace activist - and was nicknamed Sister Patchouli, or "Patch", as everyone calls her. But now at 28 years old, she believes her life is a failure, working as an ordinary store clerk in Fairfield. But there's nothing ordinary about Sister Patchouli.
