Tum Mere Ho

 Shiva is blessed with magical powers of charming snakes. When he meets Paro from a nearby village, he falls head-over-heels in love with her. She is also attracted to him. But Paro's dad, Choudhry Charanjit Singh with not pleased with this match, and he hires men to subdue and kill Shiva, all in vain. Then Shiva attempts to resuce Paro from a shape-changing snake, and this earns him the wrath of his mate - another shape-changing snake, who will not rest until Shiva is dead.
