Quarks

 A message that has lost its meaning in our time. We put up walls in social situations and allow our selfish desires to engulf our choice making, resulting in our suffering. Raquel, the sister of a savant brother, does not understand this. Raquel's brother Matt, strongly believes that beings will arrive that night. Raquel's best friend Serena tries to calm Matt as he protests that 'they are coming tonight, nothing matters anymore!' They figure he'll be quiet if they just let him finish his story. Will Raquel learn something about herself through her brother's story or is this 'story' a reality?
