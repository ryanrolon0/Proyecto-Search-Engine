Rendezvous in Space

 Frank Capra's last film was a documentary for Martin Marietta Corporation, shown at the Hall of Science Pavilion of the New York World's Fair of 1964-1965. After a series of scenes of Earth from space, narrator Danny Thomas gets various opinions on space travel from "the man in the street" (actually, actor Sid Melton and players from other Capra films like Charles Lane, Alan Reed, Doodles Weaver and John Litel, plus a black woman, an Asian man, a heavyset woman, a man with a large family, and a no-nonsense type who says knowledge isn't expensive, ignorance is.) Animated sections illustrate the invention of gunpowder, a typical space shuttle visit to resupply a space station, and the problems to be overcome living for long periods in space.
