The Face on Mars

 Face on Mars enters the moment of departure when a person enters a fugue state. Reading descriptions of individuals suffering from amnesia or fugue states, there always seemed to be a decisive moment where the person chose to leave their life behind -- letting go of every shred of self. The text adapted from Antonin Artaud's peyote fueled writings.
