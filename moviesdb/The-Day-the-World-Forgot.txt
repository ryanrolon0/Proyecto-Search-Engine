The Day the World Forgot

 Inspired by writer Richard Matheson (I Am Legend, Twilight Zone), The Day The World Forgot paints an eerie picture of the world's human population as it migrates to the coasts. Our hero, a lone businessman, meets his last companion on the beach where he watches packs of fellow humans gracefully disappear into the ocean. The twisted phenomenon and simple conversation reveals our hero's crisis, a deep-rooted struggle to let go of everything human. Will he follow in their footsteps?
