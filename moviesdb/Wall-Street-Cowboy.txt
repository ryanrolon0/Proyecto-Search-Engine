Wall Street Cowboy

 Molybdenum is a hard, gray metallic element used to toughen alloy steels and soften tungsten alloy. It is also used in fertilizers, dyes and enamels. Well, anyway, Roy's ranch is full of the stuff and an evil Wall Street syndicate wants to foreclose on the ranch when Roy has trouble making his mortgage payment. Roy Rogers goes back east, with his two pals Gabby and Chuckawalla, to try and raise funds to pay off the mortgage on his ranch. He approaches an old friend of his father's, Roger Hammond, a Wall Street financier, but meets with a rebuff due to the fumbling tactics of his two well-meaning friends, and the machinations of Hammond's race-horse trainer, Tony McGrath, who is working with a gang back west, headed by Miles and Bainbridge, to take over the ranch because of the rich mineral deposits on the property that Roy is unaware of. Roy sings "Me and the Rollin' Sand," "Ridin' Down the Rainbow Trail" and "Ride 'em Cowboy" and Louisiana Lou kicks in with "That's My Louisiana."
