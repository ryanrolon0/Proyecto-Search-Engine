Trois temps apres la mort d'Anna

 How to go on living afterwards? It is the end of winter. A young violinist is murdered in her apartment by a stranger. Her mother is in shock. Devastated by the violent death of her daughter, she decides to leave MontrEal and take refuge, alone, in Kamouraska, at the country house built by her maternal ancestors and inherited from her mother. She tries to rebuild an interior life by re-establishing contact with Nature, with the house, and with the objects that remind her of her childhood and that of her daughter. But the mother's grief is profound living. In extremis, she is discovered and saved in the forest by a man while she was letting herself freeze to death. They recognize each other they knew each other as teenagers. They can't help letting the amorous feelings of those times resurface. The presence of this man and the benevolent spirits of her grandmother, mother and daughter, all dead yet still present for her, help her regain her equilibrium and find the desire to live again.
