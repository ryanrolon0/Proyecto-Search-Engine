The Mechanics of ID

 Set in a not too distant future, The Mechanics of ID works on many different levels, and stands as a very dark and disturbing exploration into the mind of the criminally demented. However, another aspect of the film serves as a very morbid morality comedy concerning the aspects of adultery and what we sometimes put ourselves through when we fall for the wrong person, for all the right reasons.
