Potluck Pards

 Ben and Walrus Face are two tramp cowhands who decide to pair up and become outlaws, but miss out on the stage when it rolls by while they are arguing. Meanwhile, over at Bud's ranch, Sam Jenkins has come looking for his niece Marion, as he has strong objections to her keeping company with Bud, the broke and getting-broker fast ranch owner. Slick banker Steve Merrick, also a suitor for Marion's hand, won't loan Bud the needed money to stock his ranch, but does give him $500 for his horse Starlight. Ben and Walrus Face are in town, and overhear Merrick telling his henchman Clint to go out to Bud's ranch and steal the $500 back. Ben and Walrus Face knock Clint out, and then knock Bud out and steal his wallet. They later decide a life of crime does not suit them (via the only split screen shot ever employed by B.B. Ray, in which each character is playing to himself) and make plans to return Bud's money, but Clint steals it back from them and delivers it to Merrick. Potluck describes the rest of the film. Two unemployed cowboys decide to become outlaws and overhearing a planned robbery they get there first. But then learning the man they stole the money from sold his horse to get the money to get married, they decide to give it back. When they are then robbed by the original robber, they join up with the victim to retrieve the money.
