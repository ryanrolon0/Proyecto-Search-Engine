The Old Cemetery

 Far from home in Los Angeles, California, Danish model Gitte Mikkelsen falls into deep depression after losing her beloved husband in a horrible auto accident. When she hears voices speaking to her in Swedish, she fears she's gone mad, and tries to take her own life. But a series of events bring her back to Scandinavia where she ultimately finds peace, love, and self discovery in The Old Cemetery.
