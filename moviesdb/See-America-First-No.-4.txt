See America First No. 4

 The fourth in the 'See America First" series begins at the West Point Military Academy and then to the Naval Academy where, through scenes and the narrative of John B. Kennedy, the military growth of the USA is traced, up through the defense of the Alamo in the war between the Republic of Texas and Mexico in 1836. It also details the later annexation of Texas to the United States.
