Rwanda' Mama

 In Rwanda Mama, half-Rwandan/half-Italian filmmaker, Marilena Delli joins her physically-disabled mother (who lost her entire family and was orphaned as child in the 1959 genocide) as she returns to her country for the first time in over thirty years and reunites with her best friend who she had long believed was killed during the 1994 massacres.
