Son of Eyeball Man

 Created by the US Government during the cold war to fight The Soviets, Eyeball Man is an experiment in atomic warfare gone wrong. Seeing revenge against his evil brother Rat Face, Eyeball Man goes rogue and shares his top secret genetic structure with The Soviets. A new breed of deadly Mutants created by the splitting of the atom result. The Soviets launch an all out battle on The Eastern Seaboard of The United States. Only a handful of tribal war-lords known as The Last of The Americans can stop Eyeball Man from diminishing what is left of The United States.
