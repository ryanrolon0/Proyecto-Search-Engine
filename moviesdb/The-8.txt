The 8

 In June 2009, Tamaas, an international non-profit arts organization, invited eight poets and filmmakers coming from France, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, and the United States, to Tangier, Morocco. These four poet-filmmaker pairs collaborated using Super 8 film and writing original text to create these experimental "film-poems." Working under tight time constraints-they had just four days to film, four days for sound, and four days for editing, the artists took inspiration from the city of Tangier-its history, architecture, people, politics, as well as from each other, to produce these short film-poems.
