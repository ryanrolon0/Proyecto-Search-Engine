Police Stop!

 POLICE STOP! is a high-speed, white-knuckle ride through the often dangerous, sometimes bizarre and always unpredictable world of the British traffic cops. No actors, no stunt-men, no script - but every minute as exciting as the movies at their best. This is real-life action, as it happens, captured on camera by the police to put you behind the wheel on some of their hairiest pursuits.
