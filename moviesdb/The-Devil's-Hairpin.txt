The Devil's Hairpin

 Cocky car racer Nick Jargin has retired since he nearly caused the death of his brother at a hairpin bend on a circuit. He now holds a trendy cafE who keeps him busy full time until one day, Tony Boari, a new champion racer, challenges him. Nick returns to competition and this time around he will have not only to beat his new rival but also his own demons. Kelly, her pretty lover, and Mrs. Jargin, his no-nonsense mother will help him to.
