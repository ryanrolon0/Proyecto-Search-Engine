The Peddler's Bag

 The wayward son of a landed gentleman persecutes the gamekeeper's wife with his attentions, and, in the husband's absence, bribes the village peddler to carry him into the cottage in a bag. Cutting his way out at dead of night, he alarms the wife, who seizes a gun and shoots, then flees in panic. The gamekeeper, suspicious, hastens home in time to be suspected by those who find the body, is arrested and brought to trial on the evidence of the butler, who has heard him threaten the young master. At a dramatic moment the signed statement of his wife and the arrest of the peddler bring about his release.
