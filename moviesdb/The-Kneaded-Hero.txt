The Kneaded Hero

 Cliff is a pizza delivery man by day, a guitar shredder of the highest order by night. He knows his band, Isengard, is on the edge of greatness. However, no one else in the world seems to think so. When running into a high school rival on a delivery, he realizes traditional life goals may be more fulfilling than arpeggio sweeps on his beloved guitar, Dr. Shred. When an unforeseeable tragedy occurs, the future of the band and his career as a guitar player are in jeopardy. When all seems doomed, the metal gods smile upon Cliff and present him with a means to regain what was lost. Cliff must challenge fate and lead a life that is fulfilling to him.
