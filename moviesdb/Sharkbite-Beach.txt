Sharkbite Beach

 In one shocking month of 2008, the Pacific coastline of Southern California and Mexico suddenly became the focus for shark-experts and shark-hunters everywhere, as it played host to three attacks, an impassioned local backlash worthy of Amity Island and an unending trail of close shaves. It was fast, furious... and followed blow-by-blow by millions of people in a completely new way, using communication technology that had moved on apace since America's last 'summer of the shark' in 2001. The film captures the reality of shark attacks in the twenty-first century. For in 2008 as soon as an unlucky swimmer or surfer encounters a predator, his own story is a hit on the web, multiplying interest exponentially. Witnesses and victims instantly share their accounts, their photos and their videos of a sighting, a bite - even a death. Shark Bite Beach tells the story of those chaotic weeks - through the testimony of survivors, and the gripping accounts of eyewitnesses. It also explores how those who have seen friends and family attacked by sharks come to terms with their loss and, in some cases, return to the ocean.
