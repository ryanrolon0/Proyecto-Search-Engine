Private View

 Private View is a twist on the classic Elizabethan Revenge Drama. The East European beauty Lana is the charming but calculating companion of the Russian exiled oligarch Sergei. Lana is as home in the seedy backstreets of North London as she is in the swanky residences of Kensington Palace Gardens. What is her secret and what drives her? The film is shot entirely on location in London.
