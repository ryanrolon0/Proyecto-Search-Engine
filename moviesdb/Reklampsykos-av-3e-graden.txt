 Today we are exposed to more than 1000% more ad messages than we were ten years ago. Digital Signage takes this development to a psychotic level, as it rapidly creates a world where we eventually will be covered in total by digital ads. Representatives from the world's biggest out door marketing companies as well as pioneering digital signage players explain in this documentary what their businesses are up to and what the future will look like. Marketing and media researchers expand the debate to concern also thoughts on the content and artistic side of ads. Limits for provocation and moral in ads are ventured with opinions on the extreme Oliver Toscani pictures and Hollywood stars campaigning against poverty in Africa. A video artist with her works shown in between ads on giant out door screens in Tokyo takes part in the discussion. Her ads for forgiveness, which show a series of psychotic women breaking down, add a harsh contrast to the rhetoric of the billion dollars ad industry.
