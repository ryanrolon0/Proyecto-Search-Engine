The Mix-In

 Money. Women. Drugs. Sammy has one week. One week to come up with a quarter million dollars or he's dead as disco. But Sammy's a man with a plan Mix-In. Now all he has to do is convince a drug-dealing psychopath and a wannabe criminal that his plan will work and hope that they keep their end of the bargain. For Sammy, it's just another day in the life of a con-man.
