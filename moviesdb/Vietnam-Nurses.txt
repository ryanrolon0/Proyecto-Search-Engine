Vietnam Nurses

 Arriving in Saigon amidst the stifling heat and the overwhelming US military presence six young Australian army nurses found themselves hit with the reality of the Vietnam War. Based at Vung Tau at the only Australian field hospital, the nurses were little prepared for the horrific injuries they were confronted with. Even for those with trauma experience, it was a huge learning curve. From the thrill of riding in a chopper across the beautiful Vietnamese countryside to the life and death situations they faced in theatre and intensive care, the women tell the untold stories of their Vietnam War.
