The Shape of Water

 Within the symbolic logic of a dream, a woman dances within a tiny house that rocks back and forth on the edge of a cliff. Below the vertical rocks is a vast sea and she also joins imaginary beings down in this weird watery landscape and finds they all resemble her, representing other parts of fractured self. Water holds the key as her battle with its rough waves and the tilting movements of the house give way to a new calmness as she succumbs to the smoothness of being surrounded entirely by a deep, dark watery depth.
