The Road Taken

 The film chronicles the lives of the hundreds of Black men who worked as sleeping car porters on Canada's trains from the early 1900s until the 1970s. In the early years, when job opportunities were very limited for Blacks, being a porter was considered a prized position. This in spite of the fact that these men routinely encountered racism from passengers, employers, and even co-workers.
