Sagebrush Troubadour

 Before he was murdered Grandpa Martin found a gold mine. He failed to record it and now everyone is looking for Martin's old horse that can lead them to it. When Autry arrives to investigate, he is accused of the murder and finds the Sheriff after him. Ranger's Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) are on their way to solve the murder of old, half-blind Frank Martin and, when nearing town, they are forced off the road by a recklessly driven coach with Joan Martin (Barbara Pepper), the old man's granddaughter, at the reins. When he reaches town, Gene receives several high offers to sell a swayback horse in his possession, which, with a guitar string are the only clues to the killer of Martin. These offers come from liveryman Hank Polk (Fred Kelsey), Joan's sweetheart Lon Dillon (Dennis Moore as Denny Meadows), Henry Nolan (Hooper Atchley), the dead man's lawyer and from his foster-son John Martin (J. Frank Glendon) as all know the horse is the key to Martin's lost gold mine. Without letting anyone know who they are, Gene and Frog go to the Martin ranch to play for a dance, and the old swayback is placed in the barn with the intention of attracting the killer.
