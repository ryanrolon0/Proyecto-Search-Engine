The Significant Other

 When operating a Bed and Breakfast it's better to be married? Or is it? Clara will find that her fictitious husband may cost her the love of her life. Her first guest, Rick, is gorgeous, sweet and single but he thinks she's married. Clara doesn't know how to tell him that she's not really married, and after running into her "husband" with his male lover, Rick doesn't know how to tell her that her husband is gay and cheating on her. The Significant Other is hysterical romp where love checks in and sanity checks out.
