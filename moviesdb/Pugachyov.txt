Pugachyov

 Emelian Pugachev pretends to be Czar Peter III and leads an uprising against Catherine. His Cossack-Bashkir army has some success, and the people in the territory believe him to be the Czar. But the uprising is short-lived and Catherine's forces crushes his army, and he is drawn-and-quartered on the block.
