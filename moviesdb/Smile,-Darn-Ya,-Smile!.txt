Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!

 Foxy is a streetcar driver who sings "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!" as he drives along the tracks. Nearly everyone he encounters sings along can't fit into the car, the girl-fox who can, and the hobos on the side of the tracks. Even the characters on the billboards come to life and sing. Foxy's job is not without troubles. His first difficulty is the cow who blocks his way and refuses to move. Later, he's in more serious trouble when he loses control of the car, sending him and the girl-fox careening down the tracks at top speed.
