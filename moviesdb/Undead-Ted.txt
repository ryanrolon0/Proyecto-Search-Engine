Undead Ted

 Edward Grey's life has been on the downward spiral ever since the day of his death. Not only must he deal with rising damp, bone decay and rot - but also the fact that he is now jobless, penniless and without girlfriend. A documentary crew follows Ted around for a day providing intimate insight into the heart-wrenching world of the walking dead. Life can bring many challenges... but death can be a bastard.
