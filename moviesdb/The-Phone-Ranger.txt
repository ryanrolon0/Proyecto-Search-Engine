The Phone Ranger

 Lenny Schnable is a shy telemarketer who fantasizes about being a cowboy. Predictably, he gets no respect from his family. But when the boss offers a Mexican vacation as an incentive prize for the highest sales, Lenny decides that he has to saddle up to take on his arch-rival, 5th generation telemarketer Darcy Masterson. It's high-noon at Graphnel Products!
