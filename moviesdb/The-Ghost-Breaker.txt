The Ghost Breaker

 A young man and his manservant, escaping from a backwoods family feud, are persuaded by a beautiful young heiress to help her rid her newly-gained Spanish castle of ghosts. The ghostly sightings, however, are the handiwork of the Duke d'Alba, who hopes to seize the castle's hidden treasure and use it to win the hand of the heiress.
