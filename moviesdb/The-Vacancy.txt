The Vacancy

 Four candidates wait to interview for their dream job; each trying to avoid contact with one another. There's the stylish go-getter Marsha, desperate for the job; Tom, the cocky youngster with little guile and Jeff, the least confident, looking for change. Only one, Kate, seems content to shy away behind furtive stares and a professional air. None of the candidates notice the temperature flux from hot to cold, the conveniences of frosted donuts, drinks...and no calls for interview.
