The Cancerous

 In the not so distant future, a sweeping genetic epidemic has begun to cripple society. Even before the disease can claim them, thousands of people who might be susceptible to the disease have gone missing. The film opens on Nina Morav, a photojournalist investigating their disappearances. She discovers government workers disposing of bodies but before she can truly investigate she is spotted and she must run. Arriving home, the government has already identified her and is tearing her apartment apart. Barely getting out alive with the help of her fiancE Jameson, Nina has nonetheless become a target, possibly for more than just her photos. After loosing Jameson, Nina must make a hard decision whether to keep running or to give herself up to a big brother like government who claims to have a cure.
