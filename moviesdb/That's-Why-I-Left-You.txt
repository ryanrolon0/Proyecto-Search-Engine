That's Why I Left You

 Young couple Joe and Mary Thompson love each other and their children despite the struggles that they have that are typical of most young couples early on in their married life, such as the basics of trying to make ends meet. But after Joe leaves Mary and their inner city life, she finds an unpostmarked envelope under their apartment door with her name written in Joe's handwriting. It contains a letter explaining why he left. It has primarily to do with his feeling that another part of his life was being left behind for his married life, that other life which consists of a want to travel, especially sail the south seas. The actual impetus to leave was inadvertently fostered by Mary through the birthday present she bought for him. So what actually did happen to Joe and will he ever return to his loving wife? All men, says an off-screen narrator, live in two worlds work and bills and family pressures, and the one of their imagination, on a beach or an outrigger, foot-loose. Mary is alone, Joe has left; the children are asleep, but she's tired from the day's responsibilities. She notices that a letter has been slipped under her door - it's from Joe, explaining why he left her. As she reads, we see him on adventures in paradise, in the South Seas. They did love each other Mary can do to get him back?
