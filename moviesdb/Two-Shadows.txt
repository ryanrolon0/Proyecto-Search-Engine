Two Shadows

 Long Beach hipster wannabe Sovanna receives a cryptic letter from Cambodia claiming that her long-lost brother and sister are still alive. Ditching her dead-end lifestyle and alcoholic father, Sovanna travels to her birthplace alone to seek out her two siblings who disappeared during the civil war 20 years earlier. With guidance from a quirky motorbike driver named Munny, Sovanna launches her search into the dark corners of Cambodia. Upon discovering a girl who may or may not be her real sister, Sovanna is ensnared into an increasingly dangerous situation, pitting her in a tug-of-war between her own personal safety, and her compassion for a stranger.
