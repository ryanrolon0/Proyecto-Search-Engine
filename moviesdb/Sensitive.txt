Sensitive

 A woman in Queens who works for a firm that charges healthy fees to assist undocumented aliens apply for legal status notices a boy of about ten distributing fliers on a street corner near her office. She watches him from her window and notices that his "supervisor" seems to be a swarthy, tough-looking guy. Over the next couple days, as she goes out of her way to assist a woman whose husband has been deported after their money was stolen, she keeps her eye on the boy with the fliers. She approaches a beat cop for help. Do good deeds go unpunished?
