Sock-a-Bye, Baby

 Popeye is baby sitting, and the little one won't be quiet unless he's sleeping. Obstacles include a _Harpo Marx_ (qv) lookalike playing the harp on the street; a music school; a ship blowing its horn; a radio outside a radio store; a building construction site; blaring car horns. Popeye deals with all of these in the least efficient way possible.
