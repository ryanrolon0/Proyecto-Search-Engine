Skinnay Ennis and Orchestra

 This "Name Band Musical" from Universal, is not the same short as the Warner-Vitaphone 1941 release with the same title. Besides singer Marion Colby, who seemed to sing with many different bands during this era, other acts include The Bachelors, Hightower and Ross, and Landre and Verna. Numbers included "St Louis Blues" and "It's a Good Day."
