The Fighting Vigilantes

 Taylor's men are robbing incoming supply wagons to enable Taylor to sell goods at inflated prices. The Vigilantes led by Frank Jackson are doing the same so the ranchers won't starve. Marshals Lash and Fuzzy arrive to try and find the real culprits. While on a secret assignment, U.S. Marshal "Cheyenne" Davis ('Lash La Rue' (qv))and his partner "Fuzzy" Jones ('Al St. John' (qv))rescue Abby Jackson ('Jennifer Holt (I)' (qv))from three masked holdup men. She explains that her wagon carried nothing of value except for some provisions. They learn that Price Taylor ('George Chesebro (I)' (qv)), who has a produce business, has also been the victim of the bandits. He offers them jobs as guards as guards on his wagons and shows them a secret newspaper called "The Vigilante" which features news of the holdups. "Lash" learns from Abby's father, Frank Jackson ('Steve Clark (I)' (qv)), that the outlaws intend to corner the local food market and thus force prices up. "Cheyenne", using the newspaper, sets up a ruse to trap the person he suspects is behind the scheme.
