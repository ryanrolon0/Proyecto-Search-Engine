Silk Scarves & Steel

 Harmony Concepts bondage film with every tie-up consisting of scarves and handcuffs. The basic plot involves Stella becoming more and more furious with her roommate who stayed out two entire days without leaving word of her whereabouts. When Andrea is not the least bit repentant, Stella grabs her box and bondage toys and goes to work, binding the unrepentant Andrea in tighter and tighter bondage throughout the film. Of course, the more uncomfortable Andrea becomes, the more devilish is the revenge she plots for Stella the moment she escapes.
