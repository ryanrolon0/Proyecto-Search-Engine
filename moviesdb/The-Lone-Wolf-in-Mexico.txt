The Lone Wolf in Mexico

 A croupier is murdered in a Mexico City gambling casino and the Lone Wolf is suspected. Sharon Montgomery, wife of diamond merchant Charles Montgomery, becomes involved in a jewel heist, in which again the Lone Wolf is a suspect. Michael Lanyard/The Lone Wolf, a reformed jewel thief, finds himself the usual suspect when a croupier of a Mexico City casino is murdered. He also gets involved with the wife of a wealthy diamond-merchant, and another murder when she is killed, and it takes him only a little while to find the killer, prove his innocence, and put an end to a smuggling ring.
