The Kid from Amarillo

 Treasury agent Steve Ransom (Charles Starrett) is given the mission of unmasking Jonathan Cole (Fred Sears), head of a gang of smugglers operating near the Mexico/Texas border which is not within the length of three eastern seaboard states of Amarillo but Columbia title writers were never good at geography. In spite of Steve's warnings, his bumbling pal Smiley (Smiley Burnette) does some lone-wolf sleuthing on the Cole ranch and is taken prisoner just as Steve is getting the evidence he needs against Cole.
