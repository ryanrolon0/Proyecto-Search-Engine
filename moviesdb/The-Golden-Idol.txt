The Golden Idol

 The Lost Idol of Watusi, a valuable archaeological treasure, has come into the hands of Bomba. Murderous Arabian chieftain Ali Ben Mamoud hires the equally unscrupulous soldier of fortune Joe Hawkins to get the treasure. British museum scientist Karen Marsh, Commissioner Barnes, his number one boy Eli and Ezekiel are also seeking the Idol. Hawkins and his native henchman, Gomo, double-cross Mamoud and set out to get the treasure for themselves. Things go downhill for them after Bomba takes an active hand; he overpowers Hawkins in an underwater fight and Mamoud is drowned in the coils of a huge water snake. District policemen Reed and Graves place the surviving plotters under arrest, and Bomba and his chimp Kimbbo fade away in the jungle as Barnes, Karen and Eli disappear by boat over the waters of Pongola Basin (played by Monogram's back lot).
