Sex Education

 The Kid sits alone in front of the TV, bored, until his ears perk up when the announcer introduces episode two ("Push") in a series on human sexuality. The Kid watches and listens with rapt attention as the program depicts making a baby and giving birth. About halfway through the show, the Kid's little sister joins him on the couch. Will he protect her from knowledge too mature for her to handle? Does the Kid have a big brother's fraternal instincts?
