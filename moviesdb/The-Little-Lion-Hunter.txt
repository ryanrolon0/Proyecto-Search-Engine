The Little Lion Hunter

 Out hunting in the jungle with his spear, African native boy Inki keeps narrowly missing his prey there's that weird black bird with the syncopated hop who keeps popping up out of nowhere, only to disappear mysteriously once again. Back to big game hunting, Inki puts his ear to the ground, not noticing the ferocious lion sneaking up on him.
