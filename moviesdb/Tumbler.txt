 Spencer arrives in New York City with big dreams and aspirations. He meets a group of friends and pitches them on his investment opportunities while beginning a serious relationship with a beautiful young woman. To them, he is charismatic, reliable, influential, and utterly honest. To him, they are just more pawns to manipulate in the game. As the disparity grows between his words and his actions, his friends begin to catch on to his act and reject his attempts to further blind them to the truth. At the end, all he has left is his girlfriend - and she may not be coming along for the next journey, either.
