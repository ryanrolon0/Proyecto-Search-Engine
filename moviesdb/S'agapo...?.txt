S'agapo...?

 The movie is trying to question why lovers/partners say I love you to each other. The story is placed in a contemporary Greek city and shows the random crossing of six couples from different age groups (from 17 years old to 60). We witness the circumstances under which they choose to say I love you or not to say it at all. What is the meaning of this phrase?
