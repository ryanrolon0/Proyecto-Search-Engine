Queen Victoria's Funeral [Number 3]

 A close view of the funeral procession coming toward the camera. This view is of particular interest, as it shows the naval brigade drawing the gun carriage, after it became impossible to control the horses. King Edward VII, and Emperor William walk in the military escort at the rear of the carriage.
