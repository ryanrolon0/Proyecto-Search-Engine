Termites from Mars

 When a local observatory notices Martian spaceships rocketing through space, news and bulletins are sent out to warn Earth of their inevitable invasion. When Woody notices a bulletin about them on TV, he pays no mind until he sees the spaceships landing outside his tree home. The Martians are revealed to be termites who immediately get to work devouring Woody's home. Woody tries to stop them but the creatures are one step ahead of him until he notices their weakness ...scotch tape which he uses to ensnare them all then put them to work in his factory making good household uses of the Martians (bottle opener, burglar alarm, etc.).
