Return to Bradford

 'Back to Bradford' is a strange footnote in history. Unexposed with archival footage and firsthand accounts, it tells the eerie tale of Allegheny Airlines Flight 736 that crashed on Christmas Eve 1968, just outside Bradford, Pennsylvania. It's 40 years later and a group of survivors and rescuers relive and retell the events as both therapy and closure. A documentary with a surprise twist, as another plane leaving the same airport crashed two weeks later not 20 miles from the same spot.
