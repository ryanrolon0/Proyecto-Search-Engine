The Making of Everest

 This documentary about the making of the hit IMAX film, "Everest", details how a climbing team lead by world-famous mountaineer Ed Viesturs and award-winning cinematographer David Breshears got an IMAX camera to the top of the world's highest mountain. Along the way, the filmmakers put down their cameras to help rescue climbers stranded on the mountain by a massive storm that ultimately took the lives of 11 people.
