 Lord Farquaad was eaten by the dragon, but his ghost has returned, and he's still evil. With the help of his henchman, Thelonious, he kidnaps Fiona. Shrek and the donkey set out to save her, with help from the dragon, before she goes over a waterfall on a raft. Made as a "sequel" before Shrek 2 hit theaters in summer 2004, Shrek 4-D, a popular ride at Universal Studios, follows Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey on their way to the hotel where Shrek and Fiona will spend their honeymoon. The only problem is that Lord Farquad has risen from the grave and has sent his henchman, Thelonious, to find Fiona and bring her to Farquad, who plans to later kill her and force her to become the queen of the ghostly world. Now, it is up to Shrek and Donkey to save Fiona from Farquad, from breaking a stone dragon to being saved by a real one, Shrek 4-D is filled with action packed adventure and fun.
