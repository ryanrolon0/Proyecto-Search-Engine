The Teachings of Jon

 "The Teachings of Jon" is an insightful, soul-touching and funny documentary about the filmmaker's brother Jon, a 40-yr old man, severely and profoundly affected by Down syndrome. He has an IQ of 20, doesn't talk and earns less than $13.00 a year. Although Jon may never accomplish much in this world, he has an important purpose here; to teach. "The Teachings of Jon" follows the journey of a family, and how the "family secret" locked away in an institution for the first 7 years of his life became the powerful silent teacher of kindness and reverence. This documentary shows what it's really like to take care of someone like Jon in heart-warming detail. Jon's parents, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist share how having Jon catalyzed a complete change of values and how he taught them about good mental health. The siblings share what it was like growing up with a brother with severe mental retardation; how they had to learn how to communicate with him and the affect he has had on all of their lives. Though the story is told in a unique cinematic light-hearted style, "The Teachings of Jon" ponders the serious questions of how we value other human beings and what is truly important in life.
