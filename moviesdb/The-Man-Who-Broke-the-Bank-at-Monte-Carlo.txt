The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo

 Russian prince goes to Monte Carlo just after World War I with money supplied him by Parisian Russians. He wins but the casino operators want him honor the tradition of returning to the tables. Paul Gallard is one of the many White Russians living in Paris, a one-time aristocrat now reduced to driving a taxicab. Several of his compatriots supply him with a gambling stake in hopes that he can reverse their downward fortunes. Paul goes to Monte Carlo and proceeds to win big, breaking the bank. The casino then schemes to get its money back by sending Helen Berkeley to lure Paul back and insure that he loses this time. But Helen finds her task complicated by her falling in love with Paul.
