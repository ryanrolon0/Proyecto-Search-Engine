The Wizard's Mistress

 A sensual woman, in many guises, seduces and manipulates the off-screen narrator into a dimension of mystery and hallucination. The scenes take place in Manhattan, moving from the chaos of Times Square to a jazz club, a confessional and the boudoir. The narrator describes himself as the Wizard, but the real power resides in the female protagonist, who may only be his mistress in imagination.
