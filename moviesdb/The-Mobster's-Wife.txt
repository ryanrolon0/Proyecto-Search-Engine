The Mobster's Wife

 A Mob boss is cheating on his wife with several women. He puts a henchman on his wife to keep her out of his hair. The hitman falls for the wife, the other henchman falls for one of the bosses girlfriends, and though the boss wants to hold on to everybody, he'll have to settle for the busty blonde twins he's left with.
