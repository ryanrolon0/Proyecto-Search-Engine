Porky Chops

 Lumber jack Porky Pig intrudes upon the peace of a hipster squirrel vacationing in the Northwoods by trying to chop down the squirrel's tree. The squirrel retaliates by enclosing the base of his tree with steel so that Porky's axes cannot penetrate. The ensuing conflict between Porky and the squirrel awakens an angry bear.
