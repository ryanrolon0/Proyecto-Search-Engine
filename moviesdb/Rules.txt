Rules

 Radha is employed with an advertising agency, and has a chance to see and meet prominent models. She meets her dreamboat, Vikram Verma, on one such day. Needless to state, she is madly in love with him, but he has eyes for his girlfriend, the gorgeous model, Maggie, only. Radha's attempts to make him notice her are in vain, and in desperation she confides in her grandma, for a solution. Her grandma instructs her to follow a number of simple rules, which will make Vikram notice her. Radha agrees to do so, but will the meek and timid young lady, be able to make an established young man like Vikram notice her? Assistant photographer Radha, silently salivates over model Vikram Verma. Of course Vikram, who already has a girlfriend (Namrata Barua as the perpetually pouting Maggie) is totally unaware of her presence. Hence, Radha is sad and distracted, and silently sighs, and sighs, and sighs... until her sprightly grandmother (Tanuja in an endearing role) notices, and offers her a solution for the problem. Her solution consists of Radha's application of 5 rules, with Nirvana i.e.; Vikram's undying love as the ultimate goal. Radha agrees, of course (duh !). Begin application. End application. Goal achieved ? Watch Rules and find out.
