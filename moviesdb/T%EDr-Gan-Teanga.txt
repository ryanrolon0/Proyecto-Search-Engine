Tír Gan Teanga

 Beginning with the classical romantic framing devices for the Irish language rural paintings of Jack B. Yeats, 'Tir Gan Teanga' (a title that translates as 'A country without a language' from the Gaelic revival proverb 'A country without a language is a country without a soul') dissolves into a scatter-shot argument on the place of Irish within society that challenges the fluency and perceptions of the viewer, as well as the central irony of translating a language that is spoken by choice.
