The Mayor's Husband

 Hugh's wife (Isabel Withers) is running for mayor on the platform of cleaning out the crooks at city hall, so the opponents send a pretty girl (Christine McIntyre) to Hugh's house to steal the evidence. Hugh, naturally, falls for her pitch and is about to turn over the papers when his wife arrives home.
