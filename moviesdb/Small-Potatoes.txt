Small Potatoes

 Small Potatoes is a quirky, lighthearted philosophical comedy about a young man who decides to run away from his adult life in order to live out his childhood fantasy - to live in a tree-house and open a detective agency. At first, everything seems to fall into place best friend; they manage to find a couple of lackeys to help with the dirty work; they even manage to land their first professional detective job (as unorthodox as it may be). Our young hero seems to be living his dream. But, as the narrator is quick to point out, Fate delights in breaking the hearts of dreamers a nightmare can be very fine indeed.
