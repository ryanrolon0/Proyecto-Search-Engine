The Maverick

 Army Lieutenant Devlin is ordered to take Sgt. Frick, Corporal Johnson and some troopers to break up a gang of gunmen hired by Frank Bullitt, leader of the cattlemen, to drive homesteaders from the range. Devlin's troop captures Bullitt and three of the hired killers route to Fort Jeffrey with the prisoners, the troop overtakes a wagon carrying Della Watson and her grandmother, and Devlin reluctantly agrees to let the two women accompany his party. Meanwhile, Bullitt's foreman, Massey, has sent more gunmen to free the prisoners, and the disgruntled Lt. Frick has sold out to Bullitt.
