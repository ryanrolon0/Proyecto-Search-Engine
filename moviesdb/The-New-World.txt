The New World

 In 2009 things changed, forever. Music and film merge in a dark and stylish series of comments on an event that changed the world. THE NEW WORLD is a film about the future (the present ?), but it's also a film about suggestion. This 7 minute huis clos (shot behind closed doors) leaves a lot of room for personal interpretation and intends to be a very personal experience - an intense trip to a very near future.
