Untitled Boxer

 Alex, an abused African-American teen, runs away and quickly matures while living on the streets, amid a prejudiced society. Alex rises to greatness in the sport of boxing to become a world-class Olympic heavyweight title contender. Alex rekindles an interracial relationship with Lalenia, an old school mate, just as the Olympic championship bout looms. The title is won, only to be stripped away when someone from Alex's past comes into the picture and exposes Alex's true identity. Is every issue really a matter of race...?
