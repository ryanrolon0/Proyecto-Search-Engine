Valkyrie Profile

 On a tale based loosely on Norse Mythological tales. Ragnarok is about to begin in the holy world of Asgard and the lead god Odin could not find strong enough warriors to serve the Aesir race. So Odin and the two supreme goddesses, Frey and Freya, send out a woman named Lenneth Valkyrie, to collect the souls of deceased warriors and witches to help the Aesir of Valhallah to protect their land and every other land from the rebellious Vanir.
