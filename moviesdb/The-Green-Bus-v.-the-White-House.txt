The Green Bus v. the White House

 In a tight 2002 US Senate race in Minnesota, Democrat Paul Wellstone is running against Republican Norm Coleman, a White House ally who was personally picked to run by Vice President Dick Cheney. Shortly before the election Wellstone begins to pull ahead in voter surveys and polls, but just as he is beginning to take a commanding lead, he is killed in a mysterious plane crash. Former US President Walter Mondale is recruited to run on the Democratic ticket against the White House's candidate and faces an uphill battle.
