The Frozen Inferno

 In the post-apocalyptic near-future, the world is held in the icy grip of a nuclear winter. The residents of a massive network of concrete bunkers struggle to survive against starvation and radioactive mutants. When a search party is lost on a routine "supply run", the colony finds a nearly-dead man lying in the snow. The new addition to the colony's population happens to be a shifty-eyed Russian refugee named Evanushka.
