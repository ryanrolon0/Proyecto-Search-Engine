Santa Fe Scouts

 With the imminent passage of a new squatters rights bill, a crooked lawyer is after a ranch and has a man living on it. When the Mesquiteers kick him off the lawyer stages a phony murder which persuades the owner to let him return. When the Mesquiteers learn what has happened it is the final day before the law takes effect and when they go to evict him they find the narrow pass entrance blocked by the man and his cohorts.
