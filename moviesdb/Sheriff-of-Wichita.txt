Sheriff of Wichita

 It has been almost five years since the outlaws have stolen the army payroll from Lt. Raymond D'Arcy. While claiming that he gave the money to Major Bishop, neither the money or Bishop have ever been found and Raymond was convicted of the theft. Now he is at the abandoned fort, an escaped convict with a letter, looking to find the truth about the robbery. Members of his old command are also there and Rocky shows up to return Raymond to prison. Nancy Bishop, seeking to prove that her father, now missing for five years along with the money, did not steal army funds as charged, sends letters inviting five known acquaintances of her father to an abandoned fort. The five assemble there, where 'Rocky" Lane, the sheriff of Wichita, also arrives, posing as one of the invitees. Sam Stark, the bandit leader of the area, arrives after stationing his men around the fort, with the intent of gaining the money. The loneliness of the location begins to wear upon the nerves of the men, one of them breaks under the strain, shouts his confession and is slain while attempting to escape. Lane and Nancy locate her father's body, and the missing money, and then the Stark gang shows up.
