The Edge of the World

 Three men are reunited after 30 years by the echoes of a terrible crime. Old men now, and at the end of the line they are intrigued to meet a young girl named Sarah. Through her they are plunged back into the sordid (and hilarious) belly of Australia's underworld, both past and present. In the summer of 1959, Bennie was a boxer, William a "stand-over" man and Claude a card shark. Each was embroiled in fun and trouble in a classy seaside bordello, The Pacific Hotel. Thirty years on and the Pacific is now a shadow of its former glory, a nasty place run by a nasty pimp named Blue. Sarah, a working girl at the new Pacific Hotel, finds a post card, from days gone by and stirs echoes of a terrible crime. Now old men, Bennie, William and Claude are reunited by the mystery of the post card and the young girl who found it. The unlikely team is plunged into the sordid and sometimes comic belly of Australia's underworld, facing pros, conmen and all kinds of unlikely humor, The Boys soon find that the criminal world has changed. But not that much! When Bennie and William are handed the opportunity to right the wrongs of the past, or to finally make off with 30 year old loot they are forced to make a dramatic choice. Save the girl, or take the money. Their decision is made for them and surprises them!
