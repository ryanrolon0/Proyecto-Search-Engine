Three Little Bops

 Three hip, Little Pigs are travelling entertainers, moving from straw to wood, to brick nightclubs, playing swinging tunes for high-class, "with it" crowds, but an uncool Big Bad Wolf keeps intruding on their act with with his "corny horn" and uses it to blow their nightclubs down when they throw him out- until they are playing in their brick club and the Wolf tries a more drastic, explosive method for destroying the "House of Bricks". Musical retelling of the classic children's story, "The Three Little Pigs," this time set to a hip rock-flavored jazz beat. Three pigs have formed a jazz trio and play in upper-class nightclubs, entertaining the crowds with their uptempo rock-flavored music. All's well until The Big Bad Wolf, armed with a horn, repeatedly makes unwanted auditions to join (and no wonder; the off-key wolf is awful). Each time, the frustrated pigs throw the inept Big Bad out, with the windy wolf retaliating the first two times by blowing down the pig's nightclubs -- appropriately, the first made of straw and the second of sticks. Big Bad's third attempt comes when the pigs perform their gig in a nightclub made of bricks. After he's thrown out and Big Bad's unsuccessful attempt to blow down the brick nightclub, the wolf makes several more attempts to join and/or get back at the pigs. Finally, the exasperated wolf makes one last desparate attempt to get in -- by blowing the place up. He only succeeds at blowing himself up, but all's well that ends well
