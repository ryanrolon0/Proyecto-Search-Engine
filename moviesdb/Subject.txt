Subject

 This film, which was actually made for narcotics officers and was not meant to be seen by the general public, shows the destructive effects of marijuana, which produces "unpredictable emotional results", and shows a (phony) round-up of drug addicts in downtown L.A.--the implication being, of course, that they all started out using marijuana.
