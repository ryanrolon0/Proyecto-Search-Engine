Tout est question de fringues

 At the Fringues Fashion Shop the only thing that matters is the arrival of the new fashion collection and the satisfaction of the clients. During the sales period, a lifeless window mannequin observes the coming and going of the clients. She strives to become human like the women she sees around her. Quickly, she realizes that the difference between her and the others comes down to one thing. 'It's what you wear'.
