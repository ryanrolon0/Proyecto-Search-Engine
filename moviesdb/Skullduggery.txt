Skullduggery

 Simply, Adam is a man who happens to come from a long line of men cursed. He succumbs to the curse, and basically goes on a killing spree. Five anxious players gather for a medieval board game where merciless warlocks battle for ultimate occult power. But something is playing -- and it's no longer just a game. Some unspeakable evil is manipulating an unwitting player to play out a blood-letting orgy of unrelenting horror.
