The Victor

 In order to save his family from financial ruin, an English aristocrat agrees to come to America and marry the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Once he gets there, though, he can't bring himself to do it, and is reduced to taking a job as a waiter. At work one night he gets into an argument with a well-known prizefighter and knocks him out; a fight promoter signs him to a contract, and he becomes a professional boxer.
