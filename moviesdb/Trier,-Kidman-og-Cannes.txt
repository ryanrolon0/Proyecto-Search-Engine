Trier, Kidman og Cannes

 This journalistic report from Cannes 2003 focuses on those topics of specific interest to Danish viewers, notably the premiere of _Rembrandt (2003)_ (qv), Christoffer Boe's award-winning _Reconstruction (2003)_ (qv) and the work of the Danish companies represented at the festival. The main focus, though, is on _Dogville (2003)_ (qv) - the program features press event coverage, behind-the-scenes footage (notably, Vibeke Windeløv being told for the first time by the festival leadership that there would be no awards for Trier) and a near-exclusive Kidman interview.
