The Pack

 The Pack brings to the forefront the complexities and anguish of how any of us can get caught in the cultural and legal shift of our nation. The question The Pack catches us all with is legally accepted for dozens of years and all of a sudden it came into question?" In a hand-picked case, an ambitious Assistant District Attorney (Carlos Leon) prosecutes a wife and mother (Lucie Arnaz) for three counts of murder after her forty-seven year old husband (Scott Bryce) dies of lung cancer from allegedly breathing her second-hand smoke for thirty years. Mourning the loss of his father, their twenty-four year old son (Ryan Homchick) decides to testify against his mother. At first, the jury struggles with what appears to be a ridiculous case, but one juror's doubts forces the jury into an intriguing, emotional and complicated choice regarding addiction, loyalty and individual responsibility.
