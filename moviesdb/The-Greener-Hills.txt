The Greener Hills

 An MGM Miniature about an incurable optimist who is always giving up on his job or project to try something new, while his wife and kids humor him, thinking that some day he may make that million he always talks about. He takes over a peanut farm, but immediately starts off on a bee-hive project, leaving his wife and kids to run the peanut farm.
