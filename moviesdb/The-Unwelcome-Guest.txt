The Unwelcome Guest

 Barney Bear is out in the woods picking berries when he comes across a skunk. Fearful of the skunk's scent, he tries to avoid it but when he arrives back home, the skunk enters his home shortly after he does. When Barney discovers the skunk, he demands it leave his house. When the skunk refuses, Barney gives chase during the course of which he falls into a well and the skunk rescues him. Even after the rescue, Barney is still angry and is about to clobber the pest with a shovel but just can't bring himself to do it. So instead he dons a gas mask and invites the skunk back into his house.
