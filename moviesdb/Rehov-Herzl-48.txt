Rehov Herzl 48

 Israel after a nuclear holocaust. Nothing remains but one apartment building. To survive, its tenants adhere to the directives of the all knowing chairman of the home committee and they never leave the building. Micha, a lonely introverted man, wakes up one morning to find his favorite toy fish has disappeared. He embarks on a search for the fish, however Micha s quest leads him to surprising discoveries that will force him and the other tenants to reexamine their loyalty and their priorities.
