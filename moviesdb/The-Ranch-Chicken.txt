The Ranch Chicken

 Rastus Johnson and his wife, Dinah, live near the Circle C Ranch, and Dinah does the washing for the cowboys. When the chickens begin to disappear from the ranch-yard, the boss naturally suspects him. One day, as Dinah is taking the ranch washing to her home, the boys stretch a rope across her path, tripping her. A number of the best pullets belonging to the ranch escape from her basket. Suspicion is now a certainty and the boss, together with his fun-loving cowboys, determines to give her a lasting scare. Meanwhile Dinah, on her return home, tells Rastus of her disaster at the ranch, and they determine to return to the ranch that night and recover the pullets.
