The Best of Elmo 2

 Elmo meets Memorybot, a robot who is losing his power. When Memorybot explains that he needs "memory" to power up again, Elmo rushes to help by sharing some of his fondest memories with his new friend. In the process, Elmo learns that there's certainly "power" in friendship! (Includes Jason Mraz, Adam Sandler, Destiny's Child, David Beckham, India Arie, The Goo Goo Dolls, Feist and more.)
