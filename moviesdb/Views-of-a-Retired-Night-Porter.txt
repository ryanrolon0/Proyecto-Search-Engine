Views of a Retired Night Porter

 The protagonist of Krzysztof Kieslowski's legendary 1977 documentary "Night Porter's Point of View" is revisited by Andreas Horvath, who finds him retired and relatively well in a Warsaw suburb. He lives on a minimum pension in a characterless one-room apartment, with a giant wallpaper depicting a Hawaiian idyll. The former night porter, once a typical exponent of the communist regime, has turned somewhat milder during the years, though he still thinks that under communism life was better.
