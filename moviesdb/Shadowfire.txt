Shadowfire

 The Shadowfire of the title is a revolutionary new starship whose plans are on the person of one Ambassador Kryxix. But he has been kidnapped and it's as Zark Montor, Syylk, Sevrina Marts, Torik, Maul and Manto (collectively known as Enigma) that you must find the Ambassador and retrieve the plans. Claimed to be the first game to make use of an icon-based control system - intriguing strategy game.
