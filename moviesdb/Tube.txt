 When your tenacity overcomes everything else, its value depends on whether you are smart enough or not. One warm autumn evening three friends are celebrating the promotion of one of them. It happens so, that beer has run out, money is not enough. Oleg has money at home. Oleg, being a henpecked, is afraid to make his wife angry. He tells his friends he has left the keys at home. The story could end at this point, unless Oleg's friends, against his will, begin to help him get into his own home. He doesn't actually need this help. Reluctant to tell his friends about this, he has to participate in storming into his apartment, the keys to which he has in his pocket.
