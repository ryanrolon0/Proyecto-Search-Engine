 A dentistry student, graduating with honor, does not get the desired job and has to start working as a MASTER OF ALL TRADES in a construction company. He has to paint walls, clean chimneys, and fix water conduits. He is not able to accomplish any of these tasks and gets into funny situations all the time. Moreover, he and his roommate, a good friend of his, quarrel over a girl. But this situation is a misunderstanding as well - the friends love different girls. A happy end is in sight.
