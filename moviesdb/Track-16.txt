Track 16

 Paul Matthews only wanted to record his new song. Instead he records a murder. Now, he's got two cops who won't leave him alone. The victim's best friend following him everywhere and his bandmates wondering just where the hell he is at. But for the killer, one murder is not enough. Paul and his tape will have to be erased.
