The Reward of Valor

 Miss Pauline Bush is the girl and Mr. Kerrigan, as a "college mountaineer," is her choice. Mr. Richardson, as an English lordling, is her father's choice. The girl's brother, a new player who will please, helps out the love match. It is brought about by the old "hold-up," that scares the dude and makes the mountaineer seem a "hero."
