See You Soon Again

 Holocaust survivor Leo Bretholz has been telling his story in Baltimore since 1962. See You Soon Again shows how his story is received by Baltimore youth and the community at large Jewish-dominated Pikesville, and challenges Leo's claim that the Holocaust was the 'worst event in the totality of recorded history;' Meredith, a Catholic high-school student in Belair, MD, dedicates her Senior creative writing project to Leo, and invites him to a suburban dinner, where he tells well received Jesus jokes. Livia - third generation survivor who has steeped herself in yoga philosophy - cannot hear the story anymore. The story, like Leo himself, is driven by his memory of the last good-bye from his mother and sisters.
