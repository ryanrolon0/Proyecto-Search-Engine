The Adventure Golf Guy

 Big-hearted Peter Green is everyone's hero on the twisting, turning, diving and crazily rolling hills of his adventure golf course. On a day like any other, Peter takes on Joe, the new course pro. Womanizer, slacker; Joe just doesn't get it as Peter connects us to the beauty of a simple life--a life where honest to goodness values always triumph.
