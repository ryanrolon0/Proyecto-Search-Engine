Sing Me a Song of Texas

 Wealthy rancher Charley Bronson invites both of his nieces, Laurie Lang and Hilda Cartwright, neither of which knows him by sight, to his Texas ranch in order to watch them and decide which one should be his heir. He poses as the ranch cook while he studies the girls. Bronson is leaning toward Laurie, the night club singer, but turns against her when Hilda, who has found out the truth, secretly invites Laurie's show business and musician friends to the ranch to celebrate Laurie's "inheritance." Bronson angrily reveals his true identity and Laurie leaves. Ranch foreman Steve Andrews, who has found out that Hilda was responsible for the invitations, stops her at the train station and brings her back to the ranch, just in time for the closing number by the Hoosier Hotshots. The two nieces of the deceased Charley Bronson arrive to learn that an unknown judge will determine which one of them will inherit his ranch. But Bronson is still alive and posing as the cook. Hilda learns of this and sets out to use this information to win the ranch from her cousin Laurie.
