See-Saw Sweethearts

 When you're nine years old, love isn't always what it seems. Lucy and her friend have the see-saw to themselves, and the day is like any other. When James turns up on his hot new BMX, he can't help but capture Lucy's attention. But when they lock eyes and James offers her the other swing, she's much too nervous to accept. As she watches him, her imagination begins to run wild with dreams of the two of them; heroes, together in their own world. Little does she know that James has an entirely different ending in store.
