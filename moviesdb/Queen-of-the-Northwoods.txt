Queen of the Northwoods

 The villain of this serial, the "Wolf Devil", who's head covering amazingly looks to be a REAL wolf's head, is determined to eradicate the non native races from Alaska. Quite a large goal as compared to other serials of this period! He at one point captures the heroin, played by Ethelyne Clair. Drugs are involved.
