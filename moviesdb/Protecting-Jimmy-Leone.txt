Protecting Jimmy Leone

 The Leone family has recently suffered the cruelest and most senseless of losses in that of their youngest child.  Trapped in the flood waters of a horrific storm, 6-year-old Billy Leone has drowned.  The family is struggling to stay together, and yet all the while they are cracking apart at the seams.  Amid the staggering chaos reaped by Hurricane Katrina, we witness the redemptive power of their love and devotion to one another. In a ruined city of drowned hopes and lost dreams, they'll have to rebuild their home, face down their demons, and take back their lives.  But in a neighborhood without walls, where a family's problems can be put on display, these tasks become ever more complex.  An incident of misplaced rage spurs a crisis that could tear them apart forever.
