The Night of the Living Duck

 Daffy's reading a scary comic book. The story ends in a cliffhanger, and Daffy rifles his bookcase looking for the next issue. A clock falls, and beans Daffy, making him think he's the featured act in a nightclub. All the customers at the nightclub are classic movie monsters. Fortunately, there was a bottle of "Eau de TormE" in Daffy's dressing room, which makes him sing like 'Mel TormE' (qv). He sings "Monsters Lead Such Interesting Lives" to the room, and they love it. Then he goes around the room, greeting the patrons, but his good-natured ribbing of "Smogzilla" doesn't go over well with the giant lizard, who eats Daffy. Daffy wakes up, to find himself stuck in a wastebasket, along with the comic he was looking for, with "Smogzilla" on the cover. Daffy scoffs, and the cover comes to life, saying, "You were expecting maybe Calvin Coolidge?"
