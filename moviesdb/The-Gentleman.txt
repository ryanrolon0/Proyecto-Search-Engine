The Gentleman

 Eccentric Hollywood director Rande Richardson has it made successful, and famous, with a stunning wife and a multi-million dollar mansion. The posh and glamorous Ava Garrison is signed on to star in his next film, and Rande is on the brink of achieving his life long goal - an Oscar. But Rande feels threatened when young playboy actor Dane Masterson steps into his territory. Rande's success is endangered by his jealousy and inability to make decisions on his own. The superficial Hollywood life that Rande has built for himself proves to be fleeting, and Rande must come to terms with who and what really matters.
