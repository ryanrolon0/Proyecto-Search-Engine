The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising

 The Warsaw Ghetto was established in November, 1940. More than 450,000 Jews lived there at one point. Starvation, disease and killings had reduced that number to 350,000 by July, 1942. Then the deportations began to Treblinka. On Passover eve, April 19, 1943, the German army entered the Warsaw Ghetto to liquidate and deport the remaining Jews to the Nazi death camps. Then the Jews revolted. The Warsaw Ghetto was established in November, 1940. More than 450,000 Jews lived there at one point.
