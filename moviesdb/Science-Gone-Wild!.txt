Science Gone Wild!

 An amusing but illuminating short documentary compilation of ridiculous 'science' moments from sci-fi and government 'scare' films of the 1950's and '60s. With scenes of radiation, monsters, space travel, drugs, computers, aliens, and the bomb, much of it hilarious by today's standards.
