Toe to Heal

 What is most important? Is it the journey? Or is it the destination? "I started dancing at a time in my life when everything was upside down," said Stephanie Durham. "It was like I went to a place where I was therapeutically healing physically, emotionally, spiritually, and the more people I spoke with, the more people shared how they ended up in some fashion healing a portion of their lives, or an issue, or a relationship, or a physical thing. "And I got this idea help transform me, then it would benefit others." What is most important? Is it the journey? Or is it the destination?
