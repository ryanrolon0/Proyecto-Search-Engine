Rave'n

 This indie rock opera follows the desperate and strung out singer/songwriter, RAVE'n, as he performs the songs that are the story of his twisted, painful life. A stylized blend of drama and music, this film artfully uses visual images juxtaposed against powerful lyrics to convey the character's state in a unique, moving way. Winner at the Newark Paul Robeson International Film Festival.
