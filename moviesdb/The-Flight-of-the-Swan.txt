The Flight of the Swan

 The drive for success over 20 years transforms a young idealist into the embodiment of everything he hates. A cataclysmic ecological and human tragedy shakes him to his senses. To reclaim his soul he must expose the beast he serves - even if it kills him. Alexis is an explosive personality, passionate about life, humanity, nature, love and beauty. That is until the breakneck rhythm, intensity, stress and convolutions of career and economic success shatter him, alienating him from everyone and everything he loves his soul mate Maria. Alexis is jolted back to reality when the unbridled greed of the multinational conglomerate his company is involved in causes an unprecedented ecological catastrophe costing many human lives. The multinational's Golden Boy suddenly realizes that he is nothing more than a cog in the machine he had fought so passionately against in his youth. He is determined to rediscover himself, to reclaim his soul, to rebuild the dream with Maria - but he is completely trapped. He is caught in a web of intrigue that tightens like a vice driving him to an inevitably lethal conflict with the conglomerate. The story quickly evolves into a nerve rending adventure with driving action, relentless conflicts, unexpected reversals, insurmountable dilemmas and volatile internal pressures all leading to the triumph of love, friendship, beauty and life.
