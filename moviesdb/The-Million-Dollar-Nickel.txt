The Million Dollar Nickel

 The title of this short refers to the 5-cent stamp required to send a letter overseas from the USA. In the war against Communism, these letters are worth a million dollars, because they counter Soviet dis-information against the United States. Immigrants are urged to send letters to their families and friends back in their native countries, describing their experiences in the USA. If they tell the truth in these letters, people will know that the anti-USA propaganda is untrue. Hollywood stars 'Pier Angeli' (qv), 'Ricardo Montalban' (qv), 'Leslie Caron' (qv), and 'Zsa Zsa Gabor' (qv), speaking in their native languages, urge their fellow countrymen to get involved in this effort.
