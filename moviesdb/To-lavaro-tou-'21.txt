To lavaro tou '21

 This is one of the first Greek films to deal with Greek history. It is set, according to historic accounts, in the area of Morias in Kalavrita, specifically, in the monastery of Agia Lavra (Saint Laura) where the metropolitan bishop Palaion Patron Germanos (Germanos of Patras) hoisted the banner of the Revolution on the 25th of March. Besides these historic events, there is also a love story between Vaso and Dimos, which reminds us of the desire for life and freedom.
