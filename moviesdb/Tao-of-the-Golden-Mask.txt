Tao of the Golden Mask

 In the 70's, Langston Faizon Santisima, barely 18, left his native Cuba on an impossible quest- to direct a film starring Bruce Lee. Against all odds, and with no background in film making, the aspiring young director made it to Thailand where created a legendary but lost martial arts classic- thus becoming a founding father of the martial arts movie genre. Or not... In this mockumentary by stand-up comic Faizon Love, writer/director Love does a send-up on the documentary homage to fabled films and directors. Love's mockumentary uses a unique Thai action film (Golden Eagle) to make the outrageous claim that he, an African-American director, created the first Asian action film with kung fu scenes in it - even before Bruce Lee - but that Faizon never got his due because of race issues and the release forever suppressed. The film interviews people who substantiate his outlandish claims, such as comedian Robert Townsend (who supposedly co-wrote the script) and former heavyweight champ Leon Spinks (who says he was the action choreographer).
