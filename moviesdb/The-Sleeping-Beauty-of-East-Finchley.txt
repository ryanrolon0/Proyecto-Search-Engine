The Sleeping Beauty of East Finchley

 Joan's life is passing her by.  Her job is dull and at home she looks after her elderly Mother.  There is nothing remarkable about her - apart from an amazing singing voice which no-one ever hears.  Until that is Pat, a friendly nurse who is looking after Joan's Mother, hears Joan singing to her records one day.  Pat sings with a womens choir called the  Friends of Dusty.  Would Joan like to be a Friend of Dusty too?
