The Extraordinary Child

 A couple marries. Nine months later, a doctor comes to their flat; on the front door is an ornate poster saying, "Blessed Event." In the flat, the baby's father and a male friend play poker. The friend appears to be cheating. They smoke cigars. The mother does housework. The doctor is shocked to see that the baby, in a diaper, is the size of a grown man. The doc then joins the men in the card game. The baby escapes his carriage and crawls into hiding. Mother is distraught that she can't find the baby, while the men continue the game. The baby, staying hidden, steals the men's cigars and smokes them; then he plays other tricks. Will they find him, or do more adventures await?
