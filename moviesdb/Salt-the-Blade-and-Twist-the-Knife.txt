Salt the Blade and Twist the Knife

 2 women, 4 cats, 6 months. Salt the Blade and Twist the Knife is a satirical look at the world of female relationships. A delightfully funny film that will touch the hearts of women who have spent their lives looking for Miss Right, finding Miss Right, then losing her again and again.
