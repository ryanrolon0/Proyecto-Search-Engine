Star Pink

 In the year 2001 ½, the Pink Panther is a gas station attendant on a small planet. When a particularly dangerous-looking spaceship arrives, the panther panics and closes his station, which makes the green little pointy-nosed man flying the ship furious. The panther tries to elude the man and his search robot by all possible means, even evaporating himself in a molecular disassembler and reassembling himself in another. The man does the same, but the panther throws a flower into the reassembler, which turns the man into part flower.
