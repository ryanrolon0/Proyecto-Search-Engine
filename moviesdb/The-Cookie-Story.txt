The Cookie Story

 A man is waiting for a plane. He buys a packet of cookies. A woman sits down across from him and starts eating the cookies; she looks at him strangely when he starts eating his cookies; he ultimately sees this as a metaphor for all his relationships. The woman leaves, and he discovers the truth.
