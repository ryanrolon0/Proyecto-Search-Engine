Sexual Retreat 2

 Nelson and Celine own and operate a bed and breakfast where they enjoy spicing up their own sex lives by engaging their guests in erotic conversations. David and Anna are a conservative couple staying for the weekend. Celine believes that David and Anna can be enticed into a threesome with her friend Tracy if the conversation is steered in the right direction. Nelson disagrees and bets Celine that it won't happen before the weekend is over. The two couples share tales of voyeurism, swinging and mEnage à trois, and Tracy arrives later to join the conversation. Will the threesome happen and win the bet for Celine?
