The Homecoming of Jimmy Whitecloud

 A simple "hit" goes wrong when the Mob meets its match in an unlikely opponent-Native American comedian, Jimmy White Cloud. The fast-rising comic becomes the unwitting recipient of Ray "The Tuna" Grazziano's most cherished and potentially incriminating possession, "the book". A fast-paced chase follows from the streets of New York to Jimmy's native Piuma Creek Reservation in Arizona. Along the way, Jimmy learns some powerful lessons about life as he tries to avoid death at the hands of some of New York's most ruthless mobsters. Back at the reservation, Jimmy not only finds love where he least expects, but he reunites with his Shaman grandfather and rediscovers his heritage, as they join forces to defend themselves and their people from the big-city hit squad.
