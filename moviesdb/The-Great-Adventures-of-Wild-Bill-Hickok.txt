The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok

 A short plot summary finds Wild Bill Hickok ('Bill Elliott (III)' (qv)), the U.S. Marshal in Abilene, Kansas, opposing the Phantom Raiders, a gang of renegades raiding the cattle drives over the Chisholm Trail from Texas to Abilene. Hickok organizes the boys of the town into the "Flaming Arrows" to assist him. Finally, in the 15th chapter, "Trail's End", Hickok, the "Flaming Arrows" and army scout Kit Lawson ('Kermit Maynard' (qv)) combine to put an end to the Phantom Raiders.
