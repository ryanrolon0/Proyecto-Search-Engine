The Personal Life of Mr. Phelps

 A TV spy listens to his familiar tape recorder as a couple dines. This seemingly innocuous beginning builds and eventually boils over into a complex and intriguing auditory and visual experience filled with love, suspicion and violence. Dave Edelson (AKA Dave Tolchinsky) weaves this urgent world, using incredible compositions, a sophisticated sound track and his own very-wry humor. This film also has the best opening credits around.
