The Dairy Maid's Revenge

 "The dairy maid while coming from the barn with two pails of milk, suspended from a yoke on her shoulders is met by a young city chappie, who tries to kiss her and spills some of the milk. She finishes up the mischief by ducking him with the remaining contents of the pail."
