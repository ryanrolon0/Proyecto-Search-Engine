Special Delivery

 Toothfairy Inc., is a band of secret operatives who travel the world upholding the time honored tradition of leaving money under kids pillows in exchange for their baby teeth. They are highly skilled, heavily trained and provided with magical tools to complete their jobs. Bicuspid 54 is one of their best and he knows it. SPECIAL DELIVERY opens with Bicuspid 54 completing yet another perfect exchange. But when he is sent on another job he finds that everything in his world begins to crumble. His skills begin to bumble, his training begins to fumble and his magical tools are all a jumble. This time he'll need all of his wits and experience to hear those sweet sweet words; 'Mom, Dad, the toothfairy came!'
