Ted's 12

 Young ted gets a chance that will change his life. the opportunity to watch the house when his family goes out on a friday night. all mayhem ensues as the power goes out, the freaky neighbor stops by and fantasies galore fill young ted's mind. this film has family friendly written all over it. what a great story and movie. Fully grown Ted Palmer reminisces about his youth, in particular the first time his parents left him all alone in his house for the night. Imaginative young Ted makes big plans, but doesn't plan for big storms, power outages, and a visit from a strange, scary neighbor. A nostalgic slice of the 80's for the whole family.
