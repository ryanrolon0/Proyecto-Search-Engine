Si Graham Norton

 Graham Norton introduces this documentary about Mexico. He stays in Mexico City with a family of Mariachi musicians and meets a variety of interesting personalities, including witches who strip him naked and spit tequila all over him. While exploring the city, Graham loads up on love spells with pornographic-sounding names at a street market and tries to arrange a meeting with the President of Mexico and visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
