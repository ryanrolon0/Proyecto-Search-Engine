Roxanne

 Palm Beach, Florida-one of the premier enclaves of the super-rich. A community in which private jets are as common as bottles of Dom Perignon. Young and innocent all-American beauty Roxanne Ulrich comes to town an outsider in this tightly knit society, but, by the time she leaves, she is its most notorious member. Roxanne is quickly seduced by the charming Herbert Pulitzer, handsome, older and possessing a confidence born of inherited wealth. Theirs is a whirlwind romance, the kind that exists only in fairy tales. But Roxanne's desire to raise a family conflicts with Herbert's breakneck life in the fast lane. Desperate to indulge himself, Herbert sweeps a confused Roxanne into a pattern of cocaine-fueled nights and affairs. She tries to break away from the depravity and devote herself to her children. The marriage is torn apart and a bitter divorce battle ensues. Soon the world is shocked by the intimate details of their decadent life.
