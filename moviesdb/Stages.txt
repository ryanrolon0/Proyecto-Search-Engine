Stages

 'Stages' is the story of a day in the life of Brad and Scott, two actors who starred in a TV series twenty years ago. They have fallen on hard times and are now working jobs outside of show business to make ends meet. The film explores the psyche of those who give up a 'normal life' to pursue a life of creative endeavor, the madness, desperation, hope, joy and denial.
