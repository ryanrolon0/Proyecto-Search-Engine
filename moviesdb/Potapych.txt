Potapych

 Why is it easier to make friends than keep them? When Potapych's first friend (a bad man) is taken away, he is left alone for a long time, which is not good for a bear. However he meets Mishr and, despite the latter not drinking a reputable brand of vodka, their lives are transformed into ones of drinking and fun.
