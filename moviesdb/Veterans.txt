Veterans

 The film 'Veterans' tracks five US Vets recovering from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), as they make their way through the streets of Los Angeles. Locked in solitary battles of isolation, dislocation and memory, these Vets converge in a quiet alley and find themselves joining in a ritual re-enactment of combat before returning to their separate lives.
