Wait for Me

 Daniel Gillies, a professional actor, decided to take off for Panama, one week after making a decision to make a movie of his own. He invited his designer/artist friend Geoff Oki to come along as camera man on the last minute trip. Armed with one Sony HD camera borrowed from a friend and one wireless microphone Gillies bought a few days before he left, the duo shot day and night for one week straight in Panama City and various surrounding areas to create the fictional narrative film 'Wait For Me.'
