She-Sick Sailors

 Olive is more interested in her Superman comic book than in Popeye. Bluto overhears this and dresses as Superman, then performs various stunts to convince her positioning himself just in front of a station; stopping bullets with armor (thank goodness Popeye had his spinach can). As Bluto is tying her to the tracks, Olive finally recognizes him and Popeye eats his spinach and turns into a real superhero.
