The Second Greatest Story Ever Told

 A gently comic contemporization of "The New Testament, "The Second Greatest Story Ever Told...chapter one" introduces Jake of Brooklyn, Jesus' "younger, dumber brother." "Second Greatest" is a valentine not to any religious institution or religion itself, but the universal desire toward a language of hope that can be mutually shared. Mira Sorvino plays Jake's mother, her story chronicled in this first chapter -- immaculate conception being a far different proposition in 1960 Brooklyn, NY. The film was broadcast on the BBC and in 17 other countries, winning humanitarian awards in Denmark and Sweden.
