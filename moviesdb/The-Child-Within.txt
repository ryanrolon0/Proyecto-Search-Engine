The Child Within

 "The Child Within" is a story about three young, pregnant women from Bulgaria, Belarus and China, who are lured to America with promises of respectable jobs and new lives. Shortly after their arrival, they find themselves stripped of their freedom and dignity. Their American dream turns into a nightmare of depraved sexual labor. Betrayed by those they trust the most, they are sucked into the belly of a monster called "sex trafficking".
