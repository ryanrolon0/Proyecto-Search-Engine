Together Alone

 Together Alone shows that life in a Ukrainian shelter is grim. Children sleep four to a room and have barely any possessions. There is not enough money to celebrate the birthdays of individual children. Still, for many of the children the shelter is a major improvement compared to their life outdoors. Their parents cannot care for them; they are either dead, in prison, or otherwise unable to look after their children.
