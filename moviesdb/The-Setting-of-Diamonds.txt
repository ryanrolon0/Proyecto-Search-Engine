The Setting of Diamonds

 Jennifer Jackson, a former soloist with The Royal Ballet, worked with 24 teenagers from a North London Girls' School over 6 weeks to create a new dance from old ideas. Inspired by the Ballets Russes and drawing on the principles of classical dance, the choreography in this piece reflects Jennifer's concern about identity and the objectification of women in the modern world. The concepts underpinning the dance are brought out in this film, which follows the schoolgirls' final rehearsals before a public performance at the Peacock Theatre in London's West End. The collaboration between choreographer and filmmaker also reflects the ideas of feminine communion central to the dance piece that Jennifer and the girls have created.
