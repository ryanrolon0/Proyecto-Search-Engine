The Blonde from Singapore

 A couple of adventurous pilots-turned-pearl-divers encounter a helpless woman whose missionary parents have died. They entrust their cache of pearls to her, but discover that she is actually not what she claims. Fortune hunter Mary Brooks, posing as a missionary's daughter, strives to beat a couple of pilots, Terry Prescott and "Waffles" Billings, (who have turned pearl divers in order to buy a plane and join the Royal Air Force), out of their pearls, while also beating off the advances of Prince Sali who wants to add her to his harem.
