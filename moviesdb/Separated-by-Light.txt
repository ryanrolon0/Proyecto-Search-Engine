Separated by Light

 America is a young girl who fancies herself quite the filmmaker. A maker of important films, films she should make&, films she could make&, films to bring a greater realization to the world and make some sense of all the nonsense. America recruits a loveable goof named Richard Parker to help her document what makes people "free". As the duo compiles their interviews, the project begins to fall apart. Desperation sets in for America. When she turns the camera on herself, America realizes how much of the point she has missed. In the "hot seat", it is Richard Parker who brings some semblance of understanding to America not only for her film, but possibly for her life.
