The Tyler Project

 This documentary informs us about Asperger's Syndrome, and involves a musician/friend who has this disorder, and is dealing with it, day in and day out. Its intent is to educate the public and promote awareness of Asperger's Syndrome, while also showcasing the musical and artistic talents of Tyler Britton, the actual person with the disorder.
