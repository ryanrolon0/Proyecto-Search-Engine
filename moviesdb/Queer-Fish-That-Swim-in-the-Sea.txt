 "A couple of oyster dredgers are shown plying their vocation in small boats on the river. One of them has fallen asleep in the bow of his boat. Two Summer girls bent on mischief swim out from the shore, and seeing the sleeping oysterman, swiftly overturn his boat, and under cover of the excitement swim away unobserved."
