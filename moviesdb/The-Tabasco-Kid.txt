The Tabasco Kid

 When a wealthy rancher tells his bookkeeper Charley that he is expecting his beautiful daughter Mary back home, the meek accountant's ardor for her is rekindled. Things become complicated when Francisco Murietta, a dashing local outlaw chief, becomes smitten with her too. Charley, a lookalike for the infamous bandito, impersonates his rival in order to win Mary, but Murietta's men aren't so easily fooled.
