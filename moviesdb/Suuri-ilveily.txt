Suuri ilveily

 Documentary about the colorful life of Vienna-born Adolf Molnar (1905-1988), who served during WWII in Finnish troops. He was born in Fasanviertel, Vienna, and lived a carefree, adventurous life as a sailor, journalist, writer, and wanderer. Molnar escaped Hitler's reign through Europe, before finally settled down in Helsinki after the war. The film is based on his autobiography "Suuri ilveily" (Unstet und flüchtig). The documentary contains archive footage, dramatized sequences and interviews.
