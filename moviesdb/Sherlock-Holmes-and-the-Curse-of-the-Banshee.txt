Sherlock Holmes and the Curse of the Banshee

 London, England 1888. The City is plagued by a series of PUZZLING DEATHS. Each victim (all males) appears to have died from a sudden heart attack. Postmortem examinations reveal their HEARTS MISSING (the organ apparently ripped from their chest by way of their esophagus). The only clues to the mystery are a handful of eyewitness accounts regarding the "Lady in White" glimpsed leaving the scene of each murder. Local authorities believe the murders to have been perpetrated by a MISS EMILY WATSON, niece to DR. JOHN WATSON, the stout sidekick of SHERLOCK HOLMES. Upon finding out that Emily is accused of murder, WATSON convinces his roommate, SHERLOCK HOLMES, a young and budding private detective, to take the case in the hopes of proving her innocence and discovering the identity of the true KILLER. Enraptured with Emily and intrigued by the murders, Holmes applies his legendary powers of observation and intuition to the investigation, discovering inexplicable clues that make the murders impossible to have been perpetrated by human hands. Going against his better judgment, Holmes combines his rigid code of logic with more unconventional methods of investigation, delving into the supernatural and uncovering an 18th century legend that depicts the same occurrence over one hundred years ago by a creature known as the BANSHEE. In the end, the only way for Holmes to stop the MONSTER is in fact to become a monster himself. He must die and be reborn in the LAND OF THE DEAD in order to face the Banshee and destroy it.
