Pyongyang Robogirl

 Pyongyang, the capital of mysterious North Korea is built to impress. There is even no need for traffic lights in the workers' paradise. The traffic police at the main intersections rank among the most beautiful women in the world. Doll-like beauties swivel mechanically while directing traffic. They stand statuesque in electric blue uniform, short hair-cut, strong make-up and black-visored cap.
