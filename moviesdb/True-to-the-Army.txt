True to the Army

 While doing her tight-rope act in a local circus, Daisy Hawkins, see the owner shot by gangsters. The gangsters are after her to eliminate the only eye witness and the police chase her to testify against the gangsters. Daisy goes to the nearby army camp where her sweetheart, J. Wethersby "Pinky" Fothergill, is the chief carrier pigeon trainer. Rehearsal for the big army show is being held by Private Stephen Chandler. Daisy, looking like just another female impersonator to him, is mistaken for one of the boys in the chorus. Pinky sets him straight and they cut Daisy's hair and get her into a uniform, but have to work hard to convince Sergeant Butts she is one of the boys. Some honest-to-goodness pulchritude comes to the show when Vicki Marlowe, the daughter of General Marlowe, becomes interested in Chandler. Daisy wins a medal for marksmanship and the soldiers insist on taking "him" to celebrate at the town's hot spot. There, she is spotted by the gangsters when they see him/her polishing his/her nose. Rope walker Daisy, eye-witness of a murder, is chased by two hitmen and the police, who want her testiy. She goes to her friend Pinky, pigeon trainer in an Army Camp. There is a show in rehearsals. To get her secur, her hair is cut and she's put in uniform, but when she joins the other soldiers to a night club, she is spotted by the hitmen there, who decide to follow them to the show.
