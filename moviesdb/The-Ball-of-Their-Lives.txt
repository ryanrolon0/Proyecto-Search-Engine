The Ball of Their Lives

 Canada's Helicon Ball and St. Stephen's Ball, the largest of their kind in all of North America, started forty-six years ago as a way for Canada's Hungarian community to hold onto an important tradition. They were inspired by Budapest's Opera Ball, which began in 1886. Hundreds of guests travel to Toronto and Montreal from the world over to relive the grandeur of the belle Epoque.
