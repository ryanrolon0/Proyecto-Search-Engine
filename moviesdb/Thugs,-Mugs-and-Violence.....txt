Thugs, Mugs and Violence....

 After the disappearance of 2million pounds worth of drugs, blame falls between the rival firms. The streets of London then become the backdrop to an intertwined game of cat and mouse between the gangs as each make their play to gain control as the story twists and turns with a host of colourful characters, shoot outs and violence. Billy and Johnny Davis are old school criminals from the East End of London, Mo Mo is the leader of Brick Lane firm whilst the South London gang is headed by Tony 'The Ant' Declan. As the story unfolds around the three gangs, we encounter Peeper's, Judge, Stardust and the Serb who further intensify the tale of double-cross, bloodshed and revenge.
