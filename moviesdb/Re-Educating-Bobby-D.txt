Re-Educating Bobby D

 Social-worker Shawn Sweeney has been given a new assignment counsel and rehabilitate a petty hate crime offender. His life partner, Darcey Tupper, a wannabe filmmaker has decided to film Shawn's new assignment, as a documentary. The chosen offender, Bobby Douche, has been convicted of Vandalism and Trespassing, and his sentence of community service is to become the focus of Darcey's documentary, "Operation Hate Crime". Bobby's pregnant girlfriend Tammy is much younger than he, but much wiser, and her love for Bobby is likely the only thing preventing him from complete moronic oblivion. After Darcey's video camera is stolen, he is forced to bring Bobby's friend Ralph into the filmmaking process. Ralph, a film fanatic, has experience behind the lens, as Bobby says, "Ralph films our friends having sex." Darcey is much like Bobby, and is oblivious to his own bigotry. In his obsession with getting the film done "his way", Darcey is unaware that he is hurting everyone in the process. When a bond is established between Shawn and Tammy, the struggle to change their respective boyfriends becomes a lesson in tolerance for everyone.
