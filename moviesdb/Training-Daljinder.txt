Training Daljinder

 Mick Roads is a Minicab Driver in Ilford. To be precise, Mick Roads is the worst minicab driver in Ilford, which puts him in the running for worst minicab driver in the world. In a typical week, Mick will have caused one of his passengers to be sick, deeply disturbed another with his description of 'monkey bumming' as a criminal punishment, defecated into a plastic bag while seated next to another passenger, spent the change from a £20 note on petrol instead of returning it to a passenger and given a grieving female passenger a somewhat stiff tissue to blow her nose on. When not dropping his paying customers off miles from their preferred destinations or lurking outside the 'Honey Trap' nightclub late at night Mick likes to spend time in the dispatch office of 'Cabs R Us'- a tiny wood veneer panelled hole in the high street. Here he chats with whoever will stand to have them around. When Daljinder, a new recruit, comes to the cab firm Mick is given the job of showing him the ropes and teaching him the minicab trade. Eighteen hours later, after discovering that Mick's methods range from the immoral to the downright illegal, Daljinder begins to wonder if this is the job for him.
