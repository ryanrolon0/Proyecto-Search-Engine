Sons of a Gun

 Lance, Craig, and Ubaldo live with schizophrenia. They also live with Larry, their alcoholic caregiver/"Dad". And even though none of them is related by blood, they've lived together as a family for 20 years. The documentary SONS OF A GUN follows this unique family as they get evicted, move into a cramped motel room, joke around, and scramble to find a new home before self-destructing.
