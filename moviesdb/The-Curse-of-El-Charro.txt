The Curse of El Charro

 In California, Maria has awful nightmares with and visions of her sister that committed suicide one year ago. Her roommate Chris invites Maria to travel with her and her friends Tanya and Rose on vacation to her uncle's house in Saguaro, Arizona, to relax. When the group arrives in the house, they immediately go to a night-club to have fun and chase some local guys for sex; however, the evil El Charro is seeking Maria killing her friends with his machete. Plagued by nightmares and her sister's suicide, Maria joins her friends on a road trip to a vacation home in a remote desert town. Once there, she finds herself hunted by El Charro - an ancient evil driven to exact a brutal revenge on Maria's lineage. The Curse of El Charro creates a world where 70's exploitation, 80's character based horror, and German Expressionist silent films can coexist against a backdrop of religious portends, bizarre dreamscapes, and chicks covered in blood.
