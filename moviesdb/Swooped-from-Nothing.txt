Swooped from Nothing

 Swooped From Nothing follows two young writer/directors from South Philadelphia and their inexperienced crew as they stumble through the production of an independent feature film with practically no money or resources. Their serendipity leads them to naively believe they can make the project worthy of top-tier film festivals in hopes to become noticed.
