Single Tracks

 An estimated 2 Million couples struggle with these complex issues. They resolve them in very individual and sometimes unbelievable ways - divorces (both amicable and ugly), open marriages, staying together. Single Tracks explores An and Elena's path to work through the initial shock, granting audiences a rare glimpse into the lives of two ordinary people undergoing tremendous transformation. An and Elena play themselves and include documentary interviews with real couples sharing their stories to remind the audience that this is happening all around us. The filmmakers take great care to avoid melodrama and use the supporting characters to re-enact actual conversations they had with others about their relationship. While autobiographic in nature, they fictionalized the supporting characters in order to maintain a smooth narrative. After 7 years together, An and Elena hit a major pothole in their marriage when Elena reveals that she is gay. This unexpected realization knocks them both off their feet and spirals them into examinations of themselves, their relationship, and love in general. Through conversations with each other and friends, bizarre first dates, and surprising new love interests, An and Elena find their off-center relationship can somehow endure. Shot with the backdrop of Utah's many landscapes and inter-cut with documentary interviews of real Utahns, An and Elena's story turns tragic comedy into a hopeful love story.
