The Last Unicorn

 A unicorn begins a long and difficult journey to find the rest of her kind, who have disappeared off the face of the earth. On her way, the unicorn earns the help of a hot-tempered misfit magician and a stubborn female companion of a forest outlaw. As they face both human and immortal adversaries, the unicorn learns of humanity, mortality, and what a world without magic would be like.
