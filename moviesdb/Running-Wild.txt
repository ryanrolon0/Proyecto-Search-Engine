Running Wild

 Christine Shaye works for the struggling television station Global Explorer. In an effort to find a good documentary subject, Christine travels to Africa to meet documentary maker John Varty. She finds out he has been following a mother cheetah for the last twelve years and is convinced she has found the best project Global Explorer can think of. One of the executives in the United States however is trying his utmost to keep the project from getting started and things in Africa aren't going that well either. John reports that the mother cheetah has died after a lion attack, leaving behind her two young cubs.
