So-poong

 A family goes to the woods, somewhere far in the country. A father, a wife and their young son are taking a ride, from which there's no way back. Of the characters, we don't (and won't) know anything, neither their backgrounds, their histories, nor their psychology. The only thing we will know is that they are going away to end their existence. Ernie (Mat Taylor), dissatisfied with urban, industrial life, turns to nature in a quest to find something new. Also featuring John Alessi, a silver can, a poster with a monkey and a ham sandwich.
