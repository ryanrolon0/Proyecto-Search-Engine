The Sedona Scene

 Some of the best art and culture in the world isn't found in New York, or Los Angeles, or even Austin. It isn't seen in London, Paris, or Athens, either. It can be found among the red rocks of Sedona, Arizona. Director Gregg Ensminger (GumptionFest) shows you one of the most honest, vibrant cultural scenes in the world, where mainstream and underground artists alike converge, bringing to the table their own unique brand of art, dance, poetry, and music.
