Rhapsody in Rivets

 At a busy urban construction site, an appreciative crowd of gawkers watches the foreman use the building plans as his score and conduct the workmen in Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, a symphony of riveting, hammering, sawing, and more. The workmen are dogs in human clothes. Elevators, picks, shovels, and a steam shovel are instruments in music making and construction. As the clock nears 5 Umpire State Building rises toward the clouds. With the pennant planted at the top and the work completed, the foreman takes a bow. Droopy leaves last, closing the door behind him. Is the rhapsody over or are there still a few bars to play?
