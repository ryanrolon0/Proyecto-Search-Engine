 A documentary that reorganizes, as the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the most crucial moments of the Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Republic, without succumbing to the shrillness of the facts. The opinions of community leaders, worldwide political leaders, intellectuals and journalists, join together to bring us closer to the complex reality of Venezuela nowadays, by revealing the country of the people.
