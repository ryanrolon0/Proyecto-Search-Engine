The Perfect Dress

 When Candace Monroe accepts an invitation to meet her boyfriend's parents at the Opera, she dives into frenzied preparation. After dissing her hardcore running buddy Mimi, hiding the alternative evidence in her apartment and powdering over her tattoos, all that remains to achieve her remodeled image is a new beige pantsuit. But when Mimi tells her she can't wear pants to the opera, Candace's fear of failure launches her into hilarious insanity. As the clock ticks towards the impending arrival, the only solution to the wardrobe crisis is breaking into the local dry cleaners to secure the perfect dress.
