Vigilante Hideout

 Rocky, a Range Detective, arrives to help Nugget with rustlers. When he learns Nugget owns only three cows, he stays on anyway and soon becomes involved in Benson's attempt to blow open the banks's safe. When Rocky upsets his plans, Benson supposedly gets rid of him by having him declared an outlaw wanted dead or alive. Then Benson takes a load of explosives into an old mine located directly under the bank vault.
