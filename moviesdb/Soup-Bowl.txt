Soup Bowl

 Every group needs a hero, every game has a winner and in 'Soup Bowl' only the field of battle will tell who can pull off the miraculous. It is strategy and it is strength and it is desire to win and be vaulted as an idol, but only a few can be chosen. Like days long ago, the mythical legends of modern characters are created on the battle field. In this case it is the battlefield of a weekly football game called 'Soup Bowl'. What is this game and how did it get its name? It is the visceral nature of man to fight and win which once was a real, concrete drama of life and death and now it is re-enacted in a more abstract way when the kids get together with some teachers to play an outdoor game of football during the lunch time recess. Everyone wants to be a hero, even the most unexpected of nerds. Who will win when the good guys pit themselves against some cheating,do anything to win characters at school?
