Suburban Cowboy

 Written, shot, and edited in under 48 hours as part of the international filmmaking competition 'The 48 Hour Film Project', the award-winning SUBURBAN COWBOY spoofs the Western genre. F. Clark yearns for the days of the Old West when men were men and shootouts at the local saloon were de rigeur. Born a century too late, he must negotiate his way through middle-class, suburban America while struggling to maintain his cowboy integrity.
