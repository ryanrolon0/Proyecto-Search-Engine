The Pinto Kid

 Texas cattleman Jud Calvert (Charles Starrett)runs into post-Civil War animosity inspired by Vic Landeau (Paul Sutton), cattle broker and secret leader of an outlaw gang, when he announces he will drive his cattle to the North rather than accept Landeau's meager offer. Landeau has his men rob and bank and the blame is put on Jud, who is forced to flee to the ranch of Betty Ainsley (Louise Currie.) Landeau's men kidnap Betty and, in rescuing her, Jud is forced to kill Landeau.
