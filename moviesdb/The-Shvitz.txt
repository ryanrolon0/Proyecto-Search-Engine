The Shvitz

 A look at the unlikely community forged in the 200 degree heat of the last traditional steam baths in the U.S. From gamblers to "new age" masseuses, from poets to rabbis, the characters form a sometimes conflicting, yet often compelling voice. The film uses the baths to give a perspective on the evolution of city life, while bringing up issues of ethnicity, nostalgia, sexuality, spirituality and ritual. "When we sit in this intense heat", says one patron, "we're all the same - millionaire and pauper". THe shvitz you refer to in New York might be very old but by no means is it the only traditional shvitz in the USA. There is a shvitz that has been in operation non stop for over 100 years in Cleveland, Ohio when it originally served as a bath house for cold water tenements at the turn of the century located at Kinsman Rd and East 116th Street. What was once a Jewish neighborhood 70 years ago is now African American but still attracts Jews as well as people of all races and religions. Rabbis to Italian and Russian mobsters, Doctors and lawyers to city sanitation workers. Steam room to rub downs to an ice cold pool. Whiskey and beer and thick steaks and all night poker games. A very popular place for stag parties.
