Smokey Smith

 Smokey, looking for his parent's killers, trails a gang to Blaze's ranch. Posing as a wanted man he join the gang. He hopes to find a ring taken from his father that will identify the murderer. The parents ('Horace B. Carpenter' (qv))('Vane Calvert' (qv)) of Smokey Smith ('Bob Steele (I)' (qv)) are murdered while traveling with a wagon train that is attacked by outlaws. Smokey swears revenge but his only possible chance lies in finding the member of the border-gang who took a ring from his father's finger. The sheriff ('Earl Dwire' (qv)) of a nearby border town makes Smokey a deputy after the latter saves his life when outlaws attack a stagecoach the sheriff is escorting. This enables Smokey to find the hideout of the gang that killed his parents, and he, posing as a wanted man, is able to join the gang. He soon incurs the wrath of gang-member Kent('Warner Richmond' (qv)), who is jealous over the attention that Bess Bart ('Mary Kornman' (qv), step-daughter of the gang-leader, "Blaze" Bart ('George 'Gabby' Hayes' (qv)), is showing Smokey.
