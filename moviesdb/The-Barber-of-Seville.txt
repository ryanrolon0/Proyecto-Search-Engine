The Barber of Seville

 Woody is standing outside the Seville Barber Shop looking at the ads. Wanting a "victory haircut", he decides to enter the shop only to find the owner has stepped out for a physical. Woody decides to cut his own hair ("I cut my own teeth") but unfortunately is mistaken for the owner when two other customers enter, one an Indian who wants a quick shampoo and the other, a construction worker who wants "the whole works" and, unfortunately, gets it. Woody Woodpecker decides he needs a haircut, but the Seville Barbershop is empty. Tony the barber, presumably, has been drafted into the army. That leaves Woody to give himself a haircut. Why not? he asks. He cut his own teeth. Woody, as a gag, combs his hair into the "peekaboo" style popularized by Veronica Lake. As he fools around, a fearsome-looking American Indian walks in, complete with an enormous headdress. Woody, not known for his genteel manners, calls the Indian "turkey-head" and proceeds to scald the poor fellow with red-hot towels. A battle ensues, ending with Woodpeckers 1, Indians 0. Next, an Italian hard-hat walks in. Woody, singing the overture from "The Barber of Seville" and wielding a badly-damaged straight razor, gives the man even worse service than the first customer got.
