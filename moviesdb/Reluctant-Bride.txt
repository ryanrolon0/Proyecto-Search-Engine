Reluctant Bride

 A money-to-burn and girl-chasing Texas oilman, Jeff Longstreet and a sensitive, dignified entomologist, Laura Weeks, find themselves together in Winchester, England charged with taking care of a brood of wild kids whose parents, both famous explorers, are reported lost while on an African safari... but, based on their offspring, they may be hiding. The kids fire their nurse and cook, and then proceed to try to unite the mis-matched Jeff and Laura, while raining havoc on Jeff's gold-digging girl friend Lola Sinclair and Laura's pompous fiancEe Professor Baker.
