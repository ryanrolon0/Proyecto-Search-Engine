Taxi at Midnight

 A man lies in bed with a woman at midnight. A taxi pulls up outside the house. The man leaves the woman, and takes a taxi ride home. The taxi driver chats with the man as he drives him home, and makes observations about married life. When he arrives home, the man's phone rings. It's the woman he left. As they speak, he discovers that the taxi driver is not what he seems to be.
