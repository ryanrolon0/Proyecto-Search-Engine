The Kid Brother

 The most important family in Hickoryville is (naturally enough) the Hickorys, with sheriff Jim and his tough manly sons Leo and Olin. The timid youngest son, Harold, doesn't have the muscles to match up to them, so he has to use his wits to win the respect of his strong father and also the love of beautiful Mary. Meek country boy, Harold Hickory (Lloyd) is smitten by Mary Powers (Ralston), travelling with her late father's medicine show. When the show burns down, Harold invites her to stay at his house with his father and brothers. When the town's money is stolen by thugs from the medicine show, Harold's father is accused, and with encouragement from Mary, Harold sets out to find the real crooks.
