The Man in Blue

 When Frankie Loomis' father, a petty thief, is killed in a shootout with Police Officer Martin Dunne, Frankie is adopted by Dunne and his wife, but is unaware that his foster-father was the one who had killed his father, albeit only in self-defense after being shot at from ambush. Frankie grows up to be a fine young man and has a job as a bank teller. Then, after serving several years in prison, Frankie's vindictive uncle Willie shows up and expresses amazement at finding a Loomis family-member working in a bank...during daylight hours. He then tells his nephew that his foster-father was the man who killed his real-father. Frankie is so upset that he makes an honest mistake with an account and it appears to the bank president, Parke Lewis, to have been an intentional theft-attempt and Frankie is fired. Uncle Willie, with intent to get revenge on Martin Dunne, then gets Frankie framed for the robbery of the bank.
