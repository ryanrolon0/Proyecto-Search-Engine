The Joseph Bonnell Story

 The true story of a young Lieutenant from West Point whose personal relationship with the Caddo Indians in 1836 defused an explosive situation and saved the Texas Army from attack. Joseph Bonnell became a Captain in the Texas Army, Aide to Sam Houston and unsung Hero of the Texas Revolution. By earning the trust of the Caddo people, Bonnell was able to prevent an attack on the Texas Army on the eve of the Battle of San Jacinto, where Texas won independence from Mexico.
