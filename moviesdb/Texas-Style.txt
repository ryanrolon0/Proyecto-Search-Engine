Texas Style

 Texas Style takes you to the competition culture of small-town Texas the parades, armadillo and frog jumping races, tobacco-spitting, cowchip throwing, steer lassooing and hog calling contests. Besides sampling the Barbecue and Chili cook offs, and visiting the local domino parlor and barbershop, we get to hear some of Texas' most remarkable fiddlers compete to the foot-stomping delight of their audience. Texas Style is an intimate look at rural Texas culture and the traditional fiddle music played on its back roads.
