The Long Way Around

 This feature-length documentary follows indie rock band Two Cow Garage as they record, release and tour behind their second album entitled The Wall Against Our Back. Incorporating interviews, studio footage, live performances, touring life and day job dues, the film presents the reality of the fabled "rock and roll life" as it is for most independent bands long drives, small audiences, bad food, loud guitars... too many smokes, not enough cash, annoying harp players... the hope of breaking even, the frustration of breaking down... doubt, passion, sleep deprivation and the determination to keep rockin' through it all. The result is an unglamorized portrait of a young band struggling to make its mark... one album at a time... one gig at a time... one mile at a time.
