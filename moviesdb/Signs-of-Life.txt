Signs of Life

 Signs of Life is about how we are living in a world full of wonderful creatures and beautiful places and we build on the land and continue to live side by side with animals and in the nature environment and how the animals live in our technological environments. It is a visual peice full of dream imagery and visual effects. The video combines many techniques of animation; claymation, drawn animation, stop motion puppets, drawing on film, and some computer animation. It is basically low-tech meets high-tech. Instead of featuring computer graphic images that are seamless, the video calls attention to the craft of animation and the collage aspect of computer graphic compositing by keeping the images rough, unpolished.
