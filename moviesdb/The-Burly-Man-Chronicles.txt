The Burly Man Chronicles

 This mammoth documentary takes use through the making of both _Matrix Reloaded, The (2003)_(qv) and _Matrix Revolutions, The (2003)_(qv). On top of seeing many pre-production and production meetings, we are also invited on the sets for both films, and get an idea of how difficult it was to accomplish the nearly impossible.
