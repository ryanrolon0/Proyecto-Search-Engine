The Corridor

 Tyler Crawley and his friends, who have been the best of buddies for more than a decade, but now they're changing - getting married, getting promoted, going bald, going insane. During a male-bonding weekend, they will discover a spectral corridor through the woods - an impossible hallway where none should be. It will lead these five men into fear, into betrayal, and into the biggest change of them all dead.
