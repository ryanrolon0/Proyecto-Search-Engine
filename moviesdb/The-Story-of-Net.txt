The Story of Net

 Orphaned by the death of his mother, 12-year-old Net searches for a father he never knew. Based on real events and developed in a community workshop, 'The Story of Net' is directed by directors Lasse Nielsen and Bancha Khemngeun, assisted only by Thai villagers with no previous acting or filmmaking experience.
