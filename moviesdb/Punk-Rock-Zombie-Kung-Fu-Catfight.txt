Punk Rock Zombie Kung Fu Catfight

 The "hair metal" explosion of the 1980s was actually engineered by some very silly-looking animated insects from outer space who later killed Kurt Cobain and made it look like a suicide. Now they begin kidnapping, tying up, torturing, and brainwashing hot-looking multi-racial New York rock chicks in an attempt to reclaim their former glory. The director is a former Nickelodeon cartoonist, but expect lots of cursing in this bizarre underground cult movie that manages to be dark and light simultaneously. Includes much actual concert footage and scenes shot in basements of rock clubs and at performer's homes.
