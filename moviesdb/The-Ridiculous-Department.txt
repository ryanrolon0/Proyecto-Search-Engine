The Ridiculous Department

 Howard Steinberger is not your typical Hollywood agent. You won't find him mingling with A-list actors or scrambling to find the next big star. Instead, he deals with clients who are a bit unconventional, or "ridiciculous," as his peers might brand them. Howard's most profitable client is a man by the name of "Rod West", a venerated adult entertainer with an unusually crooked...penis. Armed with an impressive cult following and Howard's relentless dedication, Rod is able to make a respectable living, even off camera. On this particular day, Rod is being interviewed by BBC Television and having his penis cast-molded, so anatomically correct dildos can be sold to Rod West fans all around the world.
