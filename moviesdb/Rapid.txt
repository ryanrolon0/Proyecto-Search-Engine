 A father, Frank Williams, is seemingly in a race against time to save his daughter, Ebony Williams from the unknown. An encounter with Ebony's boyfriend, Douglas, and friend, Tiffany, who both have questionable existences in Ebony's life, leads Frank on a mission to stop the unthinkable. Learning Douglas was abused as a child and that in an instance a singular event can trigger flashback that conjures up intense emotions, and Tiffany, who has secrets, but has yet to come clean about them, as a protective father, Frank is left in a state of paranoia. With Ebony having a common, but serious condition that needs to be monitored, and Frank keeping contact with a professional, who seeks to keep him grounded in reality, Frank follows the motions of someone who is searching for a new reality only to keep running into the same demons of his past.
