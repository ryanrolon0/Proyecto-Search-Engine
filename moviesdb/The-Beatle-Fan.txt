The Beatle Fan

 The Beatle Fan is a drama about Albert, a psychotic prisoner who is a devoted fan of John Lennon and the Beatles. Albert is goaded by the other prisoners in the cells around him into telling the story (in flashbacks) of what happened when he encountered prisoner Mark David Chapman, the man who killed John Lennon.
