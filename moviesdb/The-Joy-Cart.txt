The Joy Cart

 The youngest child ever to be diagnosed with Ewings launches a foundation that delivers new toys to kids in the hospital every week. He begins on a journey that would take him from his hometown in Kentucky to the Whitehouse to Ophra Wnfrey and Rosie O'Donnell shows to the supreme court and finally to Seattle Hutchins Hospital where he witnesses the first national launch of his Joy Cart.
