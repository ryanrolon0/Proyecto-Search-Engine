The Rainbow Prince

 A young veteran has just returned from the war with a brain injury. Sometimes he can't remember who he is and where he is going. He likes to dance with the birds in the park and he enjoys looking at the murals on the streets. As he moves the spirits on the murals come to him and tell him who he is and about the mission that is now his.
