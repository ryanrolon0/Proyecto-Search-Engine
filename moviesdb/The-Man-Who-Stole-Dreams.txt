The Man Who Stole Dreams

 An evil man steals the dreams of an entire village over several nights, until the villagers, with no dreams left, cannot sleep properly, and become increasingly restless. Then the man audaciously advertises the dreams for sale, so, naturally, everyone comes to buy something, even a quick nap. But young Sarah hears a familiar sound in his dream vault, and steals it, realising it is her very own dream bird. The others catch on, and all take back their dreams, leaving the evil man to be haunted by all the nightmares nobody wanted...
