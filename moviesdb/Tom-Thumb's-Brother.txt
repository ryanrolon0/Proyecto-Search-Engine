Tom Thumb's Brother

 While Tom Thumb is very, very small, his kid brother, Pee Wee, is even smaller and Pee Wee's only wish is to be as big and strong as Tom. When tiny Tom is cornered by a kitten, Pee Wee comes to his brother's rescue and proves to himself that what he lacks in size, he makes up for in quality.
