Prekobrojna

 Young Mikajilo and his girlfriend Malena attend yet another work action. This time Mikajilo meets a student Nada and falls in love with her. Malena, who has many times before gone after Mikajilo even though she was not needed in work actions, is left behind. Mikajilo's flirting with Nada provokes general laughter and ridicule and the ambitious "Don Juan" returns to his brigade and his old girlfriend.
