The New Los Angeles

 The New Los Angeles paints a portrait of an extraordinary city poised to re-frame America's dialogue about urban political and economic change. This powerful documentary takes the viewer on a journey from the bitterly fought, racially driven elections that brought Mayor Tom Bradley to power in 1973, to the historic 2005 election of L.A.'s first Latino mayor in more than 130 years, Antonio Villaraigosa. Along the way, The New Los Angeles examines how race, labor, and immigration have shaped and reshaped the city's political life and landscape. This is a story about forging coalitions, nurturing inclusion, seeding innovation, salvaging identity and building community -messages that will resonate throughout America and the world.
