The Sisters

 Three sisters attend a celebration of the inauguration of Teddy Roosevelt. Each will marry a man in attendance. Helen marries a millionaire whom she does not love. Grace marries a local man and remains in Montana. Louise elopes with Frank to San Francisco, where he has a sports writing job waiting. After the miscarriage of their first child, he loses his job when asking for a raise. Louise recovers and takes a job at a department store. Frank decides Louise is better off without him, and joins a crew on a ship bound for China. Louise wakes up to the earthquake and fire, but manages to escape to safety. Visiting Montana, Louise and her sisters attend another celebration, for William Howard Taft, when Frank shows up and asks for another chance.
