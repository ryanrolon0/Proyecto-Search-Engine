Qurbani Rang Layegi

 After Singer Jai Kishen is arrested for killing a Thakur's bodyguard, and sentenced to 14 years in prison, his son, Raj, is left in the care of a beggar by the name of Hamid. Years pass by, Raj has grown up in the streets and is a career beggar and hoodlum. He meets with a village belle by the name of Basanti and both fall in love. They make their living doing street shows, as Raj has blessed with a good singing voice. When wealthy Poonam meets with Raj, she falls in love with him, and decides to encourage him so that he can establish himself, which he does. He finds out that Basanti has been soliciting customers through prostitution, and will have nothing to do with her, and instead gets close to Poonam. What Raj does not know is that he has been ensnared into a life of lies and deception - where no one is what they claim to be, and that Poonam is really the daughter of Thakur.
