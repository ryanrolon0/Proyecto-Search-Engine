Pro Skater

 When Tony Hawk first starts to hit the scene on the Sega Dreamcast, it changed the way people played and designed skating games. It successfully recreated all the exhilaration of skating and served it up from the vantage point of the couch, where countless players trained their thumbs to perform amazing acrobatic feats. We feared that the excitement of Tony Hawk might be lost in its transition to the N-Gage, but thankfully developers Ideaworks 3D! have ported Tony to the handheld with much success. Now as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater debuts on the Nokia N-Gage, players can take their skilled thumbs back to the streets for a digital skating exhibition!
