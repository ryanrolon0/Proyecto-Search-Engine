Tulips for Daisy

 Daisy is a woman on the run. On the run from herself. On the spur of the moment she decided to leave New York and boarded a plane for Holland. Daisy is breaking away from the safe guarded life to which she is accustomed. As she moves forward, she begins to find her real self. From the time she arrives in the Netherlands she receives anonymous flowers and notes. She senses that there is something familiar close by. Told partially though journal entries, 'Tulips for Daisy' is set against the lush backdrop of Holland as we follow Daisy on her journey. On a train to the sea she meets Agneshka, a free spirit that helps complete Daisy's metamorphosis. The farther Daisy runs away from her life, the closer she comes to herself.
