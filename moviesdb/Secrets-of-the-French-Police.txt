Secrets of the French Police

 A burglar is recruited to aid the police in finding his kidnapped girlfriend, a lovely but impoverished flower girl. Meanwhile, a deranged Russian emigre has been claiming that his ward is actually Princess Anastasia, last survivor of the Tsar's family--but she seems to behave strangely in the presence of flowers. A series of murders and a kidnapping is all part of a bizarre plot by a mad Russian emigree to pass off his hypnotized victim as Princess Anastasia in order to get the millions as heir to the late Tsar Nicholas of Russia. It's up to the French police, aided by a deft criminal, to rescue the victim and thwart the scheme.
