The Last Crooked Mile

 The notorious Jarvis gang robs a bank, one member is killed in the subsequent shootout, they ditch the getaway car, but are recognized at a roadblock as they take it on the lam and are killed in a car chase. The getaway car is sold to a carnival sideshow, where an insurance investigator and some surviving gang members start poking around in search of the missing cash. The investigator tracks down the now-dead Jarvis's girlfriend at a cabaret, and several murders and violent incidents (including a dead body on the rollercoaster) occur as he narrows in on the culprits.
