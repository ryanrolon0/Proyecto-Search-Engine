Southern A Capella

 The eighth of 16 musical shorts directed and produced by W. Lee Wilder featuring traditional southern-USA church spirituals and folk-music. A Negro chorus directed by 'Jester Hairston' (qv) (as Jester J. Hairston), lends their expert voices in their renditions of...(all spellings exactly as seen and heard on the film, and in the copyrights)..."Dis Ol' Hammer" and "Git on Board, Little Children."
