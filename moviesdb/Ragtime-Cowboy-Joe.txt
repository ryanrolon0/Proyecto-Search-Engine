Ragtime Cowboy Joe

 When Sam Osborne, owner of the Circle S Ranch, is killed by cattle rustler Bo Gillman, the outlaw is advised by crooked attorney Virgil Parker to report the "mysterious" killing to Osborne's daughter, Helen. Steve Logan, a stranger, is jailed for the crime. He escapes and learns of Parker's scheme to steal the Circle S. Steve presents his Cattleman's Protective Association credentials to the sheriff and receives assurances of aid. Steve's former sweetheart, Mary Curtis, confirms Parker's treachery. In a gun battle, Parker, Gillman and the rustlers are rounded up and the Circle S is saved for Helen. Steve and Mary take up their romance again. Bo kills Osborne, brings in Steve for the murder, and then incites the ranchers to lynch him. Steve escapes and learns Bo is after the Osborne ranch. After informing the Sheriff he is from the Cattleman's Association, they overhear Bo planning to rustle Osborne's cattle and form a plan to bring in the entire gang.
