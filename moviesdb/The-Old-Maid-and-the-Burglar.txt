The Old Maid and the Burglar

 "This old maid has been looking under her bed for years for a man. At last she finds one, as our picture shows, who happens to be a burglar; but that makes no difference to the old maid, and she promptly falls on his neck and gives him an effusive welcome, much to his surprise and disgust."
