Scenes of the Crime

 Lenny Burroughs is a struggling auto mechanic who acts as part-time driver for Rick, a local gangster, in order to earn enough to buy his own garage and pay for his upcoming marriage to Donna. Unbeknownst to him Rick's assignment includes kidnapping Jimmy Berg, an important ganglord who has robbed Trevor Morrison, a rival mobster, of over $7 million dollars and killed three of his men including Kevin Milton, son of Morrison's partner. The plan is for Morrison to trade Berg back to his partner, Steve Wayne, in exchange for the return of his money, a million dollar indemnity, and a percentage of union municipal contracts which are very profitable for the politically savvy Wayne. However, something goes wrong. Rick contradicts Trevor's plans and seems to be following the agenda of an unknown third party by ordering Lenny to a side street instead of the agreed-upon location. When he leaves the van he's immediately run down by Wayne's men who execute him gangland style. Fearing he'll be killed too, Lenny grabs the gun and threatens to shoot Berg unless the hoods return to their vehicles. A grim stand-off occurs as negotiations continue on the phone as Lenny finds he has no choice but to act in Trevor's interest and as the principals alternate between their vehicles and the neighborhood deli.
