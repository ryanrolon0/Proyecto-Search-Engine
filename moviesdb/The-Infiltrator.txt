The Infiltrator

 Yaron Svoray is a Jewish freelance reporter who goes to Germany to write an article about neonazism. While visiting a Turkish refugee camp a gang of skinheads attack. When the police arrive, he is mistakenly arrested which gives the skinheads the impression that he is a sympathiser for the Nazi cause. Yaron sees the opportunity and slowly infiltrates the group. He is appalled and disgusted by what he sees, but he's determined to dig deeper. Yaron discovers that the Nazism runs deeper and is more powerful than he ever could have imagined. New York-based freelance reporter, Yaron Svoray, travels to Germany to research and write an article on growing Neo-Nazism. Once there, he not only witnesses attacks by mainstream Caucasians (aka skinheads) on immigrants and their families - even urinating on them in public - with impunity. When called, the Police do ostensibly take them in custody, but release them unconditionally at the other end of the town; and that provisions of 'hate laws' are initiated against minorities only. He decides to befriend one such Skinhead Group, calls himself Ron Fury, a journalist with a right-winged publication called 'The Right Way', and with the assistance of two local rabbis, decides to continue his stay in this country that many now refer to as the 'Fountainhead of Fascism' and penetrate and, and if possible, expose the people who are advocating 'Ethnic Purification'; the birth of white babies; and their connection with other hate-groups back in the U.S..
