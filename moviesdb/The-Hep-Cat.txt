The Hep Cat

 The cats aren't doing well at all in luring the mice into their traps, so they decide to have one of their hep-cat band members make like the pied piper of old while trolling musically through the streets of Miceville. So the hep-cat trolls while playing a hot clarinet, as it is known far and wide to one and all, that the citizens of Miceville are fond of 1940s swing music, and it is no time at all before the hep-mice are following the clarinet player to their impending doom...but, wait...what's that in the sky...could it be Mighty Mouse flying once again to the rescue of the Miceville citizens? Could be.
