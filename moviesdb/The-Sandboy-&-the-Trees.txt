The Sandboy & the Trees

 The lonely little Sandboy awakens in a dark forest and soon stumbles upon a strange monolith. Part tree, part human leg, this "creature" horrifies the Sandboy for inexplicable, disquieting reasons. The series of events that follow unfold as a surreal symphony of nightmare images, harkening back to childhood anxieties of the dark, the strange, the sleepless, and the slumbering.
