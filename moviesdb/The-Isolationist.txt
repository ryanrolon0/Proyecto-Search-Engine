The Isolationist

 Thomas Shore needs some time alone. He spends his days making unsolicited sales calls in a crowded call center. His boss berates him and his coworkers smother him. He has planned a relaxing vacation at a beach resort to escape the grind of his daily life. But when he arrives at his destination, he finds these people pursuing him in aggressive and increasingly invasive ways. Featuring a quirky cast including '80s pop sensation Tiffany, The Isolationist is a dark comedy about trying to get away - and failing.
