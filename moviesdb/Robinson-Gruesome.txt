Robinson Gruesome

 It seems Chilly Willy is doomed. He is marooned on a floating iceberg that is quickly melting away. Luckily, he hits dry land just as the last of the iceberg disappears into the sea. He has landed on a tropical island, the home of the lonely Robinson Gruesome. "28 years in the same location" as the sign outside his hut informs the nonexistent passersby. Now, finally, Gruesome has his first visitor. But the drawling dog is less interested in the penguin's companionship than he is in the bird's tasty flesh. For nearly three decades he has had nothing to eat but bananas. Sadly, his luck hasn't changed; it's only gotten worse. Chilly Willy is too wily to allow himself to get eaten. And somehow Gruesome's every attempt to catch Chilly puts him in the path of an angry ape.
