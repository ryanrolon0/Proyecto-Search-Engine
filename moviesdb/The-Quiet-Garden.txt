The Quiet Garden

 Ben is 26 and overweight. He earns a living as an adventure travel agent even though he's never left London. Living with his widowed mother, who is depressed, forces him to frequent 'The Quiet Garden', an area used by the residents in his block. In the garden, he reads travel books in order to live out his dreams of being a world traveler and considers these visits as vacations. When a beautiful ballerina appears, she befriends him, posing a threat to his mother. The events that follow are the catalyst for her revelation of the truth behind his father's death.
