The Road to Chulumani

 The Road to Chulumani; A journey to Bolivia with Rick Tejada-Flores, the Grandson of the Bolivian president Jose Luis Tejada Sorzano. The road leads to an abandoned castle, built by his grandfather Jose Luis Tejada Sorzano, using prisoners from the Chaco War that Boliva fought with Paraguay in the 1930s. Ageing veterans recall the brutal and senseless conflict as we see flickering images of the old battlefields. Then we travel to another family estate, and meet the descendants of the African slaves that used to grow the coca that the region produces. Klaus Barbie, a notorious Nazi war criminal, ran the sawmill at yet another old family property when he escaped from Europe after WWII. Chulumani, a sleepy provincial town full of ghosts and memories, is the end of the road.
