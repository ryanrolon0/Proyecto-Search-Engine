Sonora Stagecoach

 Accused of murder in Sonora, Rocky Camron fled and the Trail Blazers now have him in their custody. He claims he was framed so the Trail Blazers plan to take him back so he can prove his innocence. But there are those in Sonora that don't want him to return to testify and they send their henchman out to assure he doesn't make it back. In the last entry of the Trail Blazer series, the trio Marshals, Hoot, Bob and Thunder Cloud, are assigned to take Rocky Camron, a prisoner, to Sonora for trial. Rocky has been framed by bankers Joe and Paul Kenyon, and they don't want Camron to stand trial. Consequently, several attempts are made to kill Rocky on the road to the first relay station, but the Trail Blazers avert those. Things get a bit hotter on the second lap as the stagecoach driver, Steve Martin, is a Kenyon henchman.
