The Stronger Man

 Cliff Judson, a notorious bad man, in a drunken imbroglio, claims another victim. He tells his sweetheart that the shooting was accidental and she believes him. He is supplied with food and water and makes for the desert. Bert Stevens, the sheriff, soon discovers his trail, and not waiting for any supplies, soon follows him. After riding for a long time he locates Judson, with the aid of his field glass, preparing to camp. He pushes on and soon has his captive in his power. Stevens, who is now feeling the horrors of thirst and exposure to the sun, suddenly becomes blind. Judson takes advantage of the opportunity to return to his sweetheart and tells her that the sheriff did not find him. She does not believe his story; and after he has repaired to the mountains, goes in search of the sheriff.
