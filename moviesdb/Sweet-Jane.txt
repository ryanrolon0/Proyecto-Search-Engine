Sweet Jane

 Jane is a drug addict who is probably HIV-positive. Teenage boy Tony gets close to her and accepts her as a surrogate mother, but he's also terminally ill with AIDS. After another OD, the junkie Jane finds that she is HIV-positive. When she leaves the hospital trying to raise money for a dose of heroin, she is followed by the fifteen year-old Tony, who protects her in difficult situations. The boy helps her to get free of her addiction, and she finds that he is alone without a family and terminal with AIDS. They get close to each other and form a firm bond.
