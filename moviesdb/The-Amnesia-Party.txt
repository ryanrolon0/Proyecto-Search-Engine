The Amnesia Party

 This groundbreaking film uses virtually every technique and format in the filmmaking canon from live action 16mm to many diverse forms of animation (including a stop-motion musical number) to express the surreal aftermath of September 11th. Independence Day 2001, we find Mom and Dad 'keeping up with the Joneses' as they host a pool party. Dad tries to light the grill without killing himself and mom gossips with the gals about America's newest gay politician. In the pool, Son floats fully clothed observing the frivolity of it all. Their idealist life is shattered as September 11th unfolds before their eyes on live television. Son's psyche cracks and he is pressured to go to war by Dad, a shell-shocked Vietnam veteran. Meanwhile, sex addicted mother might be having an affair with the Rev, the Secretary of Defense pressures Americans to spy on their neighbors, and worst of all, Son's imaginary friend Tommy reappears to make his life a living hell! The Amnesia Party is an all out visual feast with the likes of Natural Born Killers and A Clockwork Orange. September 11th was a horrible tragedy and the consequences that followed were akin to the dark, paranoid fears found in a George Orwell, Franz Kafka story. The Amnesia Party captures a moment in time when America questioned its stability while being on the brink of war as fear and panic gripped an entire nation.
