The Reluctant Traveler

 When Marco's partner organized a scholarly, month-long trek across northern Ethiopia for himself and a few friends, Marco wished him "good luck and God-speed." Then, when illness prevented his partner's participation, Marco had to step in and take over. Now, instead of his usual tour of ski resorts and film festivals, this indie writer-director is taking a journey out of his comfort zone into the unfamiliar richness of a poor country. What wasn't supposed to be his trip, became his unforgettable adventure.
