The Untold Truth

 The Untold Truth will focus on the history of "Black Baseball" from slavery to Jackie Robinson's breaking of the color barrier and celebrate the contributions African Americans made to United States history through the great game of baseball. The documentary will be unique as it will feature today's icons from sports, music, and entertainment who discuss this time in American history and expose a new generation to lessons that have never been revealed in the proper light. The project also includes an original soundtrack featuring some of today's platinum artists from Rap, Hip Hop, R&B, Jazz, and Pop.
