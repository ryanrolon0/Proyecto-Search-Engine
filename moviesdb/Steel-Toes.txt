Steel Toes

 Rage and intolerance collide with compassion Academy-Award nominated David Strathairn portrays Danny Dunkleman, a Jewish liberal humanist, and the court-appointed lawyer representing Mike Downey, a Neo-Nazi Skinhead on trial for the racially motivated murder of an East Indian immigrant. Steel Toes takes us into the intense and fiery relationship that develops between these two men as they explore their emotional and intellectual differences. Steel Toes is a provocative exploration of the inescapable and insidious presence of racial and religious intolerance in our society. Montreal-based Michael Downey belongs to a white supremacist group who hate the multi-racial society, and believe that Lord Jesus Christ will return after this society is cleansed of all impure races, including Jews, which they believe are spawns of Satan. One day Michael takes out his anger on a Hindu East Indian, Vikram, grievously injuring him. Vikram is hospitalized but passes away. Michael is arrested and lodged in a cell. He is unable to afford a lawyer, and one is appointed for him. Michael will face more uncertainty when he finds out that his lawyer, Danny Dunckelman, is a Jew. Will Vikram's death be a lesson to Michael, who, with the assistance of his lawyer, is all set to prove to a Caucasian-dominated legal system, that he has reformed, so that his offense may be changed to Manslaughter, and he be eligible for Parole in a few years.
