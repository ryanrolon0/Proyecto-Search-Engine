The Cake

 Every Saturday Mrs Anderson goes to the Polish delicatessen on the High Street to buy her favourite cake, something she has done for the last 35 years. Agatta, a new Polish immigrant and single Mum also needs a cake today for her six year old's birthday. The last 'babka' has been reserved for Mrs Anderson - but who will leave the shop with the cake, and what will be the price?
