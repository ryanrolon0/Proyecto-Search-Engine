Veneration of Memory

 In 2004, 12-year old filmmaker Coren Helene-Gitomer began to interview his aunts, uncles, cousins, and family friends to create this cinematic portrait of his grandmother, Eleanor Kluytman, in an attempt to learn the truth about the kind of person she was before Alzheimer's disease defined her life. Married to a Sgt. Major in the Marine Corps, Eleanor was virtually left to raise a family of four on her own. Despite countless moves across the country and numerous hardships, her calm and loving nature endured. "Veneration of Memory" spans half a century of the Kluytman family history and incorporates 8mm home videos from the 1950s to 1970s, much of which was taken by Eleanor herself. The film ultimately seeks to remind us of the crucial role memory plays in defining who we are.
