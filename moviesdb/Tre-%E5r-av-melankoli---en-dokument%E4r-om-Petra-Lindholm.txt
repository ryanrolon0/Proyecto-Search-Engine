Tre år av melankoli - en dokumentär om Petra Lindholm

 The Scandinavian Carnegie Art Award is one of the biggest prize money awards for artists in the world. It has traditionally been given to painters and photographers. The Carnegie Art Award 2006 included also for the first time an artist solely known for her video artistry, namely Petra Lindholm from Finland, who won the 3rd prize of 400 000 SEK for her film Until. In the documentary Three years of melancholia we meet on a very personal and intimate level the creator of an exceptionally sensitive and openly sentimental video art untraditional for today's contemporary video artists. We also learn what Scandinavian gallery owners, critics and museum directors think of Petra Lindholm's art and of video art in general. The documentary also introduces us to some of Petra's central friends and family members. The film unfolds in particular the background and inspiration sources to the art films made by Petra during the years 2002-2005.
