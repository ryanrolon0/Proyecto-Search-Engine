The Right Temptation

 Derien McCall, a nightmare-plagued ex-cop turned private investigator, takes an odd assignment from Anthea, the wife of a wealthy real-estate magnate, Michael Ferrow-Smith interest. Her emotions quickly take over and the flirting becomes more than that. Derien conducts an affair with Michael and breaks off the client relationship with Anthea, but a desperate call from Anthea brings Derien to Michael's house late one night. What's going on, Derien wonders, has she been set up? If so, by whom? Can she solve the crime, avoid imprisonment, and rid herself of the demons of her past?
