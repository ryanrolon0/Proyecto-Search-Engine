The System Within

 Tony "Wise" Good, is an internationally famous model. He fought his way out of the inner city and rocketed straight to the top. He had it all... The career, the trophy wife, fame, fortune and all the luxuries that come with success. But his swift rise to the top did not take him high enough to protect him from the sudden fall he was about to experience. The corrupt corporate world, the government's support and participation in that corruption, and the jealousy and greed of people he knew best, all lead to a rapid downward spiral into a living hell. On the surface, "THE SYSTEM WITHIN" entices the audience with the sounds and style of the fast forward urban community. Beneath that surface we discover all is not what it seems when you are working in the system. Behind the facade and covert liaisons portrayed in the film, it becomes apparent that we all are captives in society and when we think we know the way out..we suddenly are trapped by THE SYSTEM WITHIN.
