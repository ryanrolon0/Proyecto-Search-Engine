Ram Shastra

 The Police Commissioner's (Dara Singh) life is saved by an unemployed youth, Ram Sinha (Jackie Shroff), who later on, with the Commissioner's recommendation, becomes an Inspector The Commissioner's assailant, Dhonga the great, gets five years in prison, and swears to avenge this humiliation, and the death of his brother. In the meantime, Ram meets; falls in love; and marries Anjali (Manisha Koirala), who is the sister of his fellow-inspector, Kavi (Aditya Pancholi), and subsequently gives birth to a baby boy. Years later Dhonga comes out of jail and starts his vengeance and vendatta against Ram, in such a way that Ram himself becomes a fugitive from justice for trafficking drugs, and subsequent escape from prison; his wife is killed; his son is missing; and the Commissioner has lost faith in him; and Kavi has been abducted by Dhonga and his men, until such time Ram surrenders to Dhonga.
