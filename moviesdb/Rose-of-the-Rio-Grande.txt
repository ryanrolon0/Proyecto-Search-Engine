Rose of the Rio Grande

 It is Mexico in the 1830's...a Mexico torn by warfare, whose rightful aristocratic rulers are trying to wrest it back from its conquerors. The efforts are in vain as the rebels, headed by the bandit, Captain Lugo, ravage the countryside, burning, looting, spreading terror and death. But....HOPE lives again as a new leader rises, with a song of victory on his lips. He is "El Gato" ---champion of the oppressed, unmerciful to those without mercy...and ruthless in his determination to rid his native land of her spoilers.
