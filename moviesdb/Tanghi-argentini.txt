Tanghi argentini

 A few weeks before Christmas, AndrE, a chubby middle-aged office worker in Ghent, arranges an Internet date with a woman who tangos. Trouble is, AndrE doesn't know how to dance, so he begs Frans, a co-worker, to teach him. Frans refuses - he's a superior type, proper, erect, immaculately, separate from the others, while Andre is a bit of a shlub. AndrE calls Frans's bluff, calling him boring and staid, so Frans accepts the challenge. They practice long hours; the passion of the tango infuses AndrE and when the night comes, he's ready. Frans accompanies him to a nightclub where he meets Suzanne. She and AndrE begin to dance. Then, something goes wrong. Is this all for naught?
