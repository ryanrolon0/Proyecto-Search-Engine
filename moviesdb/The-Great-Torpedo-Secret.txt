The Great Torpedo Secret

 Billy, a young man, hears that his uncle, who owns a munitions manufacturing plant, has been blown up in an explosion. He plans to pay his respects to his dead uncle, but before he can leave the house, two women from two different anti-war movements visit him, believing that he will now inherit the plant, and try to convince him to shut it down. He manages to evade them and sneak out of the house but is stopped by two men who take him to a house where he is surprised to meet his "dead" uncle, who it turns out has faked his death to get away from the peace activists who were driving him crazy. The uncle tells Billy that he if can run the plant for six months by himself so that the uncle can have a respite from those two women, he will give him a large amount of money, enough so that he can his fiancE can get married and set up for life. Billy agrees, but things don't go quite according to plan.
