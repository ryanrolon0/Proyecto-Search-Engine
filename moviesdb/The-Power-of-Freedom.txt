The Power of Freedom

 The Power of Freedom is the intimate tale of three people caught in a triangle of love, friendship, and death, but mostly death. Set against the chewy-but-with-a-firm-crust tableau of a cluttered apartment, Ashely-Rebekah Faulkner plays Susan, a young woman out picking up a pizza while her boyfriend unexpectedly dies at home. Confronted with his body, Susan must navigate her grief while surviving the machinations of her late lover's best friend.
