Songs of the Range

 The west coast Shorts Department at Warners took no back seats when it came to getting something out of nothing, as a large percentage of the product they rolled out was comprised mostly of archive footage from prior Warners features. They outdid themselves on this one as they basically got something out of nothing twice by using archive footage from their own shorts, plus one feature western; 1937's "Cherokee Strip" provided the Dick Foran footage, while earlier shorts "Henry Busse and His Orchestra,1940", "West of the Rockies, 1941" and "Cliff Edwards and His Buckaroos, 1942" made up the rest. Songwriter Jack Scholl got the director's credit because, it must be presumed, he co-wrote most of the songs that were used and producer Gordon Hollingshead gave him a credit rather than royalities. Instead of being credited as the director, a more accurate description might have been as an editor or compiler, since the likes of Noel Smith, Jean Negulesco and Bobby Connolly were the original directors of the footage used. His directing here must have been making a want-list and directing somebody to find it. Actually, Warners got something out of nothing on this one three times, as they reissued it on February 27,1954. Evidently, a "waste not-want not" policy was dear to Jack L. Warner's heart.
