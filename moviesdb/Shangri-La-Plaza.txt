Shangri-La Plaza

 A musical-comedy unsold pilot made by CBS in 1990. Macho Ira and sensitive George are two polar-opposite brothers who own an auto-repair shop in Southern California. Both men quickly fall for Amy, a beautiful widow who has inherited the local donut shop previously owned by her no-good estranged husband. Amy plans to sell the place and move with her daughter Jenny to Paris, only to find that her ex-husband had "hocked the place up down to the powdered sugar", forcing her to put off her dreams and run the place herself. Geneva was the sassy waitress at the coffee shop, and Chili the rapper-narrator-dancer on crutches. Some of the pilot's extremely memorable numbers include "Donut Hole" (Geneva, Jenny and the Customers), "Don't Tell Me I Can Really Care" (George and Ira) and "Ain't It Always the Way" (Amy, George, Ira and Geneva).
