 Have you ever battled a ghoulish demon from hell at midnight, miles away from civilization in a thick treacherous forest, in a barely there outfit? Druinia and her companion Tarek wage the ultimate battle of good versus evil. A gorgeous hot-tempered elf finds herself caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse in the evil, bloodthirsty woods near Fullriver. Druinia and the brave but stupid thief Tarek, are thrust into the fight of their lives when they discover they are being hunted down by a newly awakened ancient demon that haunts the treacherous, unforgiving forest. Their only hope is a strange mysterious ancient sword, but can they unlock its secrets before our two heroes are ripped to shreds by fiery claws from the underworld?
