 Looks to Edgar Allan Poe's magazine article, The Theory of Composition, to take apart his most famous poem. Taking Poe at his word, it breaks the poem down into looped sequences within the framework of the poem itself exploring Poe's notion of effect. It gives 'The Raven' new meaning as it reconstructs it within the framework of contemporary sound theory and advant-garde film.
