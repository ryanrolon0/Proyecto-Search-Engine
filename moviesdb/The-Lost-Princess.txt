The Lost Princess

 The warrior is Esmeralda, a princess who has brains, can fight and is pretty, too. The sexy one is Don Juan, a pretty boy laughing at danger. These two Spanish champions, along with Don Juan's sidekick Miguel, dance and joke their way through a swashbuckling, Renaissance adventure, saving the queen's English cousin from the nasty, Teutonic Krankenmal.
