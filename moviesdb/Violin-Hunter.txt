Violin Hunter

 The VIOLIN HUNTER A true story, and epic drama, The Violin Hunter is the haunting tale of one man's dream to fulfill a quest that will mercilessly captivate his very soul. In 1796, Luigi Tarisio was born to a poor carpenter in Cremona, Italy. Encouraged by his father to embrace music, Luigi at the age of twelve was as talented a violinist, as the young Nicolo Paganini. But a tragic and violent carpentry accident leaves the young boy's hands deformed. His dreams shattered, Luigi continues his labor as a carpenter, fiddling only for local festivals and pubs. At the age of 17, during a harvest festival, he plays for a crowd at the monastery. Interrupted by a Priest, he is summoned inside the church at the request of a mysterious old nun, who invites Tarisio into her chambers. There he discovers her secret ever, Antonio Stradivari. Urging Tarisio to set aside his youthful antics she commissions him to find her grandfathers treasures, and restore them to humanity. Specifically, she urges him to find Le Messie (the Messiah), the greatest violin ever created.
