Sulamit

 Europe is in war. Violence is common practice and Jews are annihilated in every possible way. Against this political and social background two charming men fight for the soul of the young and elevated actress Sulamit. One of them is the Seminarist - a manly, undeviating person with no prejudice, willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his destructive goals. The other is Maestro - a man of manners and intellect, an experienced person, able to see through immortality and to look on at the problems of the present day only in the light of eternity. Between the two stands the frail, spray-like Sulamit with her love to offer.
