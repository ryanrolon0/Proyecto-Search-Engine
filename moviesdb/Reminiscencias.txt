Reminiscencias

 Juan Daniel's memory doesn't belong to him anymore. After an amnesiac accident at the beginning of 2009, he started watching home-videos and having reminiscent dreams in the need of reconstructing his memory and identity. Months later, he found himself with too many celluloid, analog and digital memories, three generations' eyes captured by different formats. This is the neurological experience Juan Daniel suffered.
