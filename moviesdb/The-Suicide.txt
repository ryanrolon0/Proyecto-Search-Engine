The Suicide

 The only thing certain in life is death. Most humans die of natural causes but some choose to press the terminate button. A decision that has some obvious causes but several hidden ones. One of nature's biggest mysteries is how only the human mind can instruct the body to self-destruct. Rajan is a young man who has decided to terminate his existence. However a brush with the super natural and a realization of his true desires and joys forces him to rethink. Could he possibly get back from what seems like the point of no return? "The Suicide" explores the psyche of a young man through his tryst with unearthly beauty.
