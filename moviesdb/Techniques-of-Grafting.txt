Techniques of Grafting

 Learn about grafting, Air layering, clonal propagation, and scion-wood selection from members of the Orange County Chapter of the California Rare Fruit Growers. Grafting is where you take a cutting of one variety of plant and attach it to a plant of the same family. An example of this would be having an existing naval orange tree and attaching a tangerine part to it. As that part grows, it will product Tangerines while the other parts of the tree produce oranges.
