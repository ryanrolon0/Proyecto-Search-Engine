Urban Savannah

 In the urban landscape of Coventry, UK, two wild tribes roam free. In this ten-minute documentary we are able to study them in their natural habitat as the "Townies" and the "Skaters" operate within their strictly structured groups. And it is as simple as that sounds; basically this is nature programme that has a very Attenborough-esque voiceover while we look at a group of skater kids and chavs doing what those young people tend to do.
