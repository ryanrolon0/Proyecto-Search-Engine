The Banana Boys

 Mr. Wong and his patrons have been taken hostage at Wok n' Roll Chinese Restaurant by the evil Plantain Man and his henchmen. Plantain Man is threatening to kill all the patrons if they do not consume his plantains. Mr. Wong calls in his favorite interracial crime fighters, the Banana Boys, to take care of Plantain Man. The Banana Boys are a superhero duo comprised of Horace and Wing. Together they have transcended their racial and cultural barriers to fight all that is terrible, unholy, and evil in the world. In tandem, they have harnessed the great powers of the banana in ways only the brightest of imaginations can see.
