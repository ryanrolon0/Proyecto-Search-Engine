Silver City Raiders

 Lucky finds he no longer owns his ranch when Bart Dawson appears with a Spanish land grant which gives him, as sole heir, ownership of all the ranches in the valley. When Lucky refuses to give in to Dawson and then has his cattle rustled, he becomes suspicious and heads for Santa Fe to check the land records. But Dawson learns about his trip and sends his men to make sure he doesn't get there.
