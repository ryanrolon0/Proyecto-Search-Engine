The Good Mother

 In April of 2008, a group of young mothers from all over the country joined together in the heartland of America to compete for the title of Mother Of the Year. Here, amidst the buzz of the convention, these well-qualified women presented their platforms to a group of judges. One of them went on to win the national honor and became the reigning representative of mothers all over the country.
