Semmelweis

 The Vienna General Hospital; 1849. One in three new mothers die from Childbed Fever within days of giving birth. Hospital Director Klein deems it, "The price God has put on the great gift of bearing a child." But Ignaz Semmelweis, First Assistant of the ward, cannot believe it is so. Haunted by the screams of dying mothers, and fraught with nightmares, Semmelweis embarks on a quest to discover the cause and cure of the fever. What he finds, however, is a new way of thinking.
