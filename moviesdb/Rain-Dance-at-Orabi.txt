Rain Dance at Orabi

 This is a sacred dance by the Zuni Indians, in full festival attire. Several hundred of the Indians take part, dancing in unison in a long line at the foot of a terrace of characteristic Zuni mud houses, from the tops of which the squaws wrapped in gaudy blankets watch the mysterious ceremony.
