Thank You to Our Troops

 In appreciation of the sacrifices our military makes for us every day, Hollywood would like to take the opportunity to personally thank them and tell them that they are stars in their own right. Therefore, many celebrities have joined together to create a documentary that recounts stories related to the military in their own lives. Whether it be a touching anecdote about a family member or friend who served in a branch of the service and influenced their lives, their own experiences in the military, or their impressions and feelings about patriotism and appreciation, this is a must see film. Running approximately one and one-half hours the documentary will feature many celebrities who have expressed a desire to contribute including, to name just a few, Lorenzo Lamas(Renegade), Cassandra Hepburn(Hell Ride), George Lazenby(Her Majesty's Secret Service), Bruce Kulick(member of KISS), James Pitt(Avatar), and Printz Board(The Black Eyed Peas).
