The Shaman's Journey

 'The Shaman's Journey installation by anthropologist and media artist Thomas Ross Miller for the exhibition 'Schamanen Sibiriens Museum Stuttgart Staatliches Museum fur Volkerkunde in Stuttgart, Germany, in cooperation with the Russian Museum of Ethnography. Originally projected on a wide screen in 360 degree surround sound, it forms a distinct aural and visual environment. The film navigates a passage through Siberian nature and supernature, from twilight evocation of local spirits to shamanic chanting and drumming. A montage including rare photographs, petroglyphs, landscapes, and pure color combines with sounds of sea ice, wind, fire, birds, animals, and ethnographic field recordings to suggest transformations of consciousness which might have occurred at shamans' ceremonies.
