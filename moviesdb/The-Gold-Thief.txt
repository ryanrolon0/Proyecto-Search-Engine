The Gold Thief

 Mysterious losses of gold dust in the workroom of a manufacturing jeweler lead to the arrest of a young clerk whose visit to a gambling house arouses the detective's suspicions. The shortages continuing, the detective suspects an accomplice, and in the course of his investigation chances to see an old workman stroking his beard. Following the man home, the detective sees his shadow on the blind as he combs out of his beard the gold dust he has stolen. A search of the premises reveals a bag of gold dust, and the thief is traced to the lair of his confederate, where both are arrested. The young man is promptly released, to the great joy of his faithful sweetheart, the stenographer.
