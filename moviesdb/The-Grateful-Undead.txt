The Grateful Undead

 A psychedelic horror movie set in the early 1990's that follows the misadventures of two undead counter-cultural figures from the 1960's as they clash with the apathetic spirit of the slacker generation. THE GRATEFUL UNDEAD is a radical experiment in film-making that challenges audiences to experience camp without tongue-in-cheek nodding and raises the bar for what can be done in a feature for under $1000.
