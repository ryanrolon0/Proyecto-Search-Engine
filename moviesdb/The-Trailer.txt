The Trailer

 A PA who is working on a set complaining about "rolling uo cords" embarks on an adventure while given the task of delivering a reel of film to the Temecula Valley International Film Festival office. In his mind, he goes through scenes with Seabiscuit, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Matrix, Lara Croft, Bad Boys and Gangs of New York, barely making it in time to be seen.
