The Chapel

 Thrown into an unexpected situation, Lucia and Tony embark on a journey that they hope will return them home from a desolate land. Rather than weigh up their options and make a joint decision, the ever headstrong Lucia heads off into the unknown, dragging Tony with her. After walking for several miles, the pair stumble across an old, abandoned chapel and Lucia believes their fortunes have turned. Tony follows her inside but is spooked and with darkness setting in, their already tenuous relationship begins to break down. When he goes outside, on Lucia's request for firewood, he is convinced that he sees a figure dressed in a black cloak, watching him. The figure seems to be a vision, but Tony is confused and is not sure what to believe. Tony and Lucia try to settle in for the night, but Lucia's persistent arrogance causes another schism between the two and Tony storms off to sleep, but in his dreams are consumed by recent memories and he is haunted by Lucia and the figure in black. When he wakes to the sounds of a rocking horse being set in motion, he runs for cover into the kitchen, locking himself inside. As dawn begins to break Tony steps back into the main room of the chapel, carrying a knife with him for protection. He starts to look for Lucia, but then suddenly hears a threatening noise upstairs and, turning to move away from it, comes face to face with the dark figure...
