The Victory of Conscience

 A French roue' seduces a country girl and abandons her in Paris. She descends into degradation among the nightclub "dancers." When her sweetheart from the old village learns of her fate, he finds and beats the seducer into amnesia. In his new past-less state, the man becomes a priest and a great force for good, especially among the night people of the boulevard...... and a certain "dancer" among them.
