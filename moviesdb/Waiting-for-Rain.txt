Waiting for Rain

 'Waiting for Rain' is a short 3D animation that tells the story of a boy who discovers empathy and thus grows emotionally. It begins with the boy, stranded in a desert alone, waiting for rain. Instead of rain, a teddy bear falls from the clouds above. Initially angry and unappreciative about this, the boy eventually finds comfort in the bear. When rain finally comes to the desert, the boy is forced to make a difficult decision.
