Shanivrat Mahima

 Renowed and respected Sage Swami Ved Vyasji relates the story of Lord Indra to Bhagwan Shri Ganesh. In answer to a question posed by Shri Ganesh, Ved Vyasji relates the story of Lord Shani Dev, and his anger against the various Devs and Devis, when he is not amongst the favored ones of Lord Indra. Features the reincarnation of Bhagwan Indra as Lord Venketashwara to end and placate the anger created by Lord Shani, and looks at several ways of being a good devotee to him.
