Squatters

 In 1994 the state of Geneva counts 1900 squatters who occupy 75 houses. Every 200th inhabitant is so a squatter. Today the scene of squats has become an integrand part of the town. Its cultural activities are related and discussed in the newspapers. Only rarely one talks about the fact that all this is properly illegal and would not be possible elsewhere. The film brings the activities of the squatters back to the initial context of the movement ways of living.
