Sharks in a Desert Sea

 Rocio Lozano and Rocky Strong swim with and study sharks in the Sea of Cortez and at the Revillagigedos Islands, located some 600 kilometers off the tip of Cabo San Lucas. They have close encounters with whale sharks, manta rays, Galapagos sharks, white tip reef sharks and they search for white sharks.
