The Romanovs' Last Photograph

 The Romanovs' Last Photograph tells the story of the Romanov sisters, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia, in the hours leading up to their execution in 1918. The girls share their hopes, fears, and aspirations and they discuss existential themes, such as the frailty of human existence. They try to live their normal lives under constant dread of being caught on the wrong side of the Russian Revolution.
