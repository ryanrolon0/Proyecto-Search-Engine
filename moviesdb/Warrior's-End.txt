Warrior's End

 The film Warrior's End is a story of a young prince who has to come to terms with his destiny and grow up quickly in the face of war. While on a forced tour of the northwest border of his country of Midea, Prince Andreas and his escort are set upon by invading soldiers from the neighboring country of Kilea. After escaping, Andreas, his friend Johan, and bodyguard Kael realize that there is an entire army marching over the passes into the unsuspecting, undefended, Midea. Not only are the Kileans marching over the passes in the northwest, they are attacking from the southern plains and western passes as well. In order for his country to survive the onslaught, Prince Andreas must assume the mantle of leadership and create a resistance from the burnt out villages in the north to hold the line until relief and reinforcements arrive, if at all.
