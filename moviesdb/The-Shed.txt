The Shed

 A happily married couple, Samantha and Paul, have recently forged a new life in a home they've purchased, and are just settling in. While hunting around curiously in their overgrown backyard, Paul stumbles upon an ancient, musty shed. Seemingly unattended for years, mysterious things start to happen the moment Paul cracks the padlock. For one confusing and harrowing Sunday, Paul opens a can of worms that expose the many potential darker sides to his relationship with Samantha. Just when he thinks he may have come full circle, his worst fears start to come true.
