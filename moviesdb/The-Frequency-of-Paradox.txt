The Frequency of Paradox

 A 20 year old man who lives on his own frequently listens to radio waves and communicates with people over them. The man tries to connect with someone he meets over the Internet one day and his radio begins to act strangely. He hears faint voices over the air until his radio shuts down. He determines he needs a new tube to go into the back of the radio, so the next day he ventures off to purchase one. Once he purchases the new tube he installs it, and continues to try to make a connection. He experiences the same thing, except he hears what he said, and says what he heard the day before. He goes through a time paradox.
