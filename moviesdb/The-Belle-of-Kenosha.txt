The Belle of Kenosha

 Handsome Jack Hampton can't be kept down on the farm after he sees the bright lights of Kenosha. So, Jack comes to the city to make his fortune as a salesman, purveying books, brooms, and eventually oil leases (and the latter, unbeknownst to Jack, is a fraud). One day, Jack spots an intoxicated masher bothering young Betty Parker on a city street, and he intervenes. Very soon Jack and Betty are an item. But Betty's snobbish mother wants her daughter to instead pursue a local wealthy-but-dull millionaire (though her tolerant father, Amos Parker, sides with his daughter). Betty brushes the boring suitor off onto a chum, Ruth, with conspiratorial help from another friend. Meanwhile, Jack's door-to-door sales efforts aren't always lucrative; in one scene, a broom-wielding housewife takes exception to his book-selling. Coincidentally, a bank robbery takes place downtown, and Jack joins the police chief and four detectives in the chase against the two desperate gunmen, who elude the posse by boarding a train across the state line.
