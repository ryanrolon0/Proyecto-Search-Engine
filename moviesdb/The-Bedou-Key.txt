The Bedou Key

 Many centuries ago a nomadic Bedouin sister and brother discovered a lump of strange meteoric rock. When passed between their hands it creates the ability to travel through space and time. They forged the substance into the shape of a key for safekeeping. Since that day eternal whichever holds the Bedou Key also holds the ability to bend time. For their own amusement they sometimes take witnesses and leave them stranded in a foreign land, in a foreign time zone, mere mortals in these time travelers game play.
