Tribunal

 Two detectives and a forensic pathologist are assigned to investigate the brutal death of three judges whose bodies are left behind with a token message-a rolled-up one hundred dollar bill stuffed in an orifice of their faces. Without raising alarm, the detectives go about their routine of gathering evidence, asking questions, and drawing conclusions to solve the case. Alibis are checked, more questions are asked, and assumptions are drawn that eventually leads to the shocking conclusion that will leave you numb and begging for answers.
