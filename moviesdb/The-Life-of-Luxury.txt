The Life of Luxury

 Angela attempts to recreate a feast from ancient Greece using culinary texts by Archestratus. Her desire for a Dionysian orgy of debauchery and lust is threatened by her husband Richard's belief in a life ruled by order and logic. Their battle of wills and wits results in an evening of lust, exotic food, broken relationships and philosophical discourse that leaves all of the revelers bruised and bewildered.
