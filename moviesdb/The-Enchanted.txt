The Enchanted

 Royce Hagan returns from the sea to claim and inhabit a 2000 acre ranch in one of the last wild places left in central Florida. An old family friend, Booker T Robertson, welcomes him, then warns him not to get "too close" to a strange family living in the woods nearby. Royce falls in love with Twyla, the oldest daughter, and discovers the bizarre secret of the Hole in the Wall and the enchanted people who live there. A remote swamp in the backwoods of central Florida, a young white boy returned home from the sea, a wise old black man who was as "close to his blood family as he was going to get" and a strange woman who appears out of the swamp and changes their lives forever.
