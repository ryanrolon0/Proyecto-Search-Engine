Priyatelite me narichat chicho

 Dimitar Stefanov Mihajlov, formerly known as prisoner number so-and-so, can't believe his eyes. In his own home's place there is a new luxurious restaurant. On the next morning Old Chap, as his friends call him, goes to see the lawyer. Realizing that there is no legitimate way to get his home back, he decides to act according to the Jungle Law. A former militiaman, a former criminal and a Macedonian guy are the members of the aging "Magnificent Four". After long preparation and successful maneuvers the foursome hits, but... The problem is there is always tedious "buts" in man's life that turn the tide and make things different from the way one wishes them to be. The good thing though is that there is always hope!
