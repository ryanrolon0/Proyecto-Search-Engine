The Rising Dead

 A digital voice recorder plays out to the audience warning them about the sounds of the damned inhabiting the living, and the incantations that must be uttered out loud to get rid of the souls. The movie then starts out on a group of friends trapped inside a house, and a Wickedoid attempting to break in. Jennifer has three minutes to play the words from the digital voice recorder before the malicious souls rule the world forever. Stanley slowly starts turning into a Wickedoid, and Jennifer feels the pressure of replacing the batteries in the tape recorder. Matty tries all she can to comfort Stanley, while Don attempts to block the banging door with his body (doing all he can to give Jennifer enough time to play the recorder).
