Ten Violent Women

 Eight women miners get fed up with their lifestyle and decide to try crime. After successfully pulling off a jewelry store robbery, they are busted by narcs when they try to buy cocaine. The eight get sent to a prison where a butch head guard uses the prisoners for her own deviant pleasures. Two of the women manage to escape and then get mixed up with a shah who had a scarab ring stolen in their jewelry heist. Director Ted Mikels appears as Leo the Fence, who is killed by one of the women who stabs him repeatedly with her spiked heel.
