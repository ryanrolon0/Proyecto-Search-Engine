The Fighting Code

 Ben Halliday stumbles upon a mysterious range killing and discovers letters in the dead man's pockets that reveal his intention to return to his native town where his sister, Helen James, is making a lone stand to hold her property that is desired by Joshua La Plante and his gunman Joe Krull. Meeting Helen, Ben realizes she has been parted from her brother so long that she would not recognize him, so Ben decides to pose as him. With the help of another new arrival, Barry, and Judge Williams, he uncovers a plot to secure Helen's property and build a dam in the canyon that would deprive the valley of water but would water the desert property owned by La Plante. Krull murders a surveyor and frames Ben who is thrown into jail, where he meets Crosby who furnishes proof of the guilt of La Plante and Krull. Ben breaks jail and he and Barry break into La Plante's office and hide in a wardrobe closet when Krull and La Plante enter. The later pair argue and Krull kills La Plante. Sheriff Olson arrives and Krull also blames Ben for his latest murder. When Helen James mistakes Ben Halliday for her long lost brother, he is unable to tell her the truth. So he assumes the identity and starts looking into the death of Helen's father. This brings him into LaPlante's scheme to get the James ranch and he is soon a target for murder.
