We Continue in the Old Style

 A visit to Paul's Hat Works in the Richmond district of San Francisco. Paul's is a 90-year-old men's hatter, now under the ownership of four young women. The film explores their position as women at the heart of a traditionally male-dominated business, as well as their dedication to quality, handmade goods.
