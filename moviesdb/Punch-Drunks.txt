Punch Drunks

 Moe discovers Curly's unknown boxing talent when he knocks out the Champ at a restaurant when Larry plays "Pop Goes the Weasal" on the violin. Moe becomes Curly's manager, and they win every fight, with the help of Larry. At the championship game, though, Larry's violin breaks. Curly is getting beat down bad when Larry makes his unexpected entrance and helps Curly prevail. Moe is a boxing promoter looking for a good fighter. Curly is a mild-mannered waiter who goes crazy whenever he hears "Pop Goes the Weasel". Larry is a violinist recruited to play the tune. Curly becomes a great fighter and gets a championship match. Things look bad when Larry's violin is smashed, but everything turns out fine when Larry delivers the music by driving a truck through the arena wall. Moe is all washed up in the world of Boxing promotions until he discovers that Curly's rage causes him to knock people out cold everytime he hears Larry play "Pop Goes the Weasel" on the violin. Moe takes he and Larry on the road and pretty soon Curly is in the Heavyweight Championship but Larry breaks his violin and has to find a means to get music to fuel the savage beast (oddly enough he never thinks to simply whistle the tune). Fight promoter and boxing manager Moe is wondering what he'll do now that the champ has decided to drop him. He finds his future in Curley the Waiter who turns into a powerhouse courtesy of Larry playing Pop Goes the Weasel on the violin. Curley, now billed as KO Stradivarius, enjoys great success but on the night of the championship bout Larry accidentally destroys his violin and has to move quickly to ensure a win.
