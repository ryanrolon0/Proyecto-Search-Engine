The Hitchhiking Game

 The Hitchhiking Game is based on a short story by Milan Kundera about two young lovers who begin a road trip together through the desert. They banter casually as she jokingly comments about his inattention to keeping the tank full. In return, he teases her about charming another man into giving her a ride to the last station. As they pull into the next rest stop, she notices a young, sexy girl, at a payphone, looking seductively at the young man, she wishes she could be more at ease with her body as other women. On an impulse she decides to play a game with her lover. She begins to walk along the side of the road and act as if she's hitchhiking and he's a stranger offering her a ride. He plays along at first, teasing and flirting with her. She enjoys this new sense of freedom, but fairly soon, the man is visibly put off by her change in behavior. He becomes frustrated and angry that she won't stop the game and become her sweet, innocent self again. His behavior towards her changes. As the day turns into night, the game intensifies and consequently escalates to a point of no return. The two people no longer recognize each other and their love is now replaced by a much stronger aversion.
