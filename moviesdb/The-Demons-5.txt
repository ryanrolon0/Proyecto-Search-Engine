The Demons 5

 History professor James Prescott assembles a young, mismatched group of college students to chronicle the lives of five vicious serial killers, known as The Demons 5. Part of this research includes spending several days inside an abandoned maximum-security prison, where (beginning in 1938) the murderers finished their final hours. Thinking that this project will be an easy bonus toward their final grade point average, the group of kids enthusiastically jump in only to discover that The Demons 5 still exist, supported by supernatural powers granted to them by an angel of death and hell-bent on a mission of bloody revenge. The kids are soon hurled into a fight for survival as The Demons 5 trap them inside the prison and reveal their horrendous plans for them. DEMONS 5 is an action-packed, twist-filled, supernatural, cat-and-mouse thriller where the characters are forced to trust the untrustworthy, expect the unexpected, and are made to look beyond what their eyes can physically see.
