Sex Hex

 A benign corporate office suddenly becomes the sexual playground for a lesbian vampire who likes to watch her female victims seduce one another. With a drop-dead gorgeous body and typing skills to match, Monique is the perfect secretary. Her desire to cast fatal spells upon sexy co-workers and spy on their bouts of lovemaking brings her to the attention of Carl - spineless cable guy-turned-fearless vampire hunter.
