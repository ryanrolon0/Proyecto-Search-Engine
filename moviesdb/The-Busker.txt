The Busker

 An early Saturday morning the Busker sits himself down on a bench in the Wellington's water font with his guitar and dog. He plays his guitar well, people are walking pass but don't give him money. As he has not made any money playing his guitar well, the Busker plays his guitar badly, as like a beginner trying out a new song, he has a cardboard sigh leaning on his empty guitar case, the sigh reads money for guitar lessons, as people pass him they drops coins into the case. Two teenagers pass the Busker and laugh at his playing, not knowing that the Busker is archly a well known guitarist who is performing in a concert this evening, the sigh advertising the concert is displayed on a nearby wall. The short film ends where the Buskers friend, (band-member) who is the lead from the band meets with him. They both laugh at the joke of playing music badly to make extra money on the street.
