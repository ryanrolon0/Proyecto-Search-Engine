The Pups' Christmas

 Christmas morning, and two puppies (and their children) are up early. The pups are frightened by a large stuffed dog, a train set, a crying doll, a toy tank, and other toys. By the time the parents are up, the pups and the other toys have managed to break just about all the toys.
