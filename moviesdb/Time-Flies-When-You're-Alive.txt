Time Flies When You're Alive

 Time Flies When You're Alive is a gripping one-man show. Paul Linke recounts, in no small detail the highs and lows of his marriage, specifically around his wife's losing struggle with breast cancer. Solemn as the topic is, Linke finds ample opportunity to lighten the mood and even crack honest, respectable jokes. The 79-minute production is well worth the watch!
