Three Blonde Mice

 When a cop stops him for speeding, Alan tries to get out of it by claiming that he is rushing home to his expectant wife. When the cop decides to follow him home to check up on his story, Alan has to come up with a wife and child. A wrong telephone number gets Elmer Smith, married to a very jealous wife, in trouble. When his wife hears a girl's voice on the line, she pitches a fit, packs her bags and goes home to her mother. Elmer enlists the aid of his buddy, Joe, and together they work out a reconciliation plan. On the way to Elmer's home, a policeman stops them for speeding. Joes tells the policeman he is a doctor and they are hurrying home to Elmer's wife who is having a baby. The cop says he'll tear up the speeding ticket if they show him the baby. Joe drafts Hilda, the next-door neighbor, to pose as Elmer's wife, and Elmer solves the baby-problem by kidnapping the organ-grinder's monkey. Meanhile, Joe has rounded up two more blondes to help as needed. Just as Elmer's wife is coming up the sidewalk, the monkey bites one of the blondes, and the three strange girls run out the front door past Mrs. Smith. She takes her ire out on Elmer.
