Vagabondo!

 Vagabondo! is the documentary from Todd Kwait and Mark Sebastian about the singer/songwriter Vince Martin. The film evolved from conversations between Mark and Vince. Mark had not seen Vince since the 1960's when Vince had given him a break accompanying Vince on a guitar in Greenwich Village. The relationship rekindled in 2009. Todd Kwait, being a die hard music fan, studied up on Vince and discovered all the great songs and albums he had been involved in. With Todd's nourishing, a film arose depicting two folk music veterans revisiting the places where they lived and made music; Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Greenwich Village. Through their conversations, we see the importance of music and its positive impact on the human spirit.
