The World at Their Feet

 On the eve of the Women's World Cup returning to China, this film takes a look back at the American team that brought Women's soccer to the cover of Time Magazine. From the World Cup's visit to China in 1990 to a record setting World Cup Final in 1999, this film chronicles the story of these pioneering champions. Performing with grace and charisma, these women have become role models and folk heroes to a nation of little girls and boys and many parents of the same.
