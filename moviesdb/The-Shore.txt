The Shore

 Every person has his/her own shore where destiny and love are found. A couple who love each other strongly meets on the shore. He wants her to leave her home shore, to follow him as he returns to his homeland. But she does not want to leave her homeland, her shore. How will they decide? How will they say farewell?
