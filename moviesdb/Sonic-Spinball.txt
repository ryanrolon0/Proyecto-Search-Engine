Sonic Spinball

 In this Sonic spin-off, Robotnik creates the Veg-O-Fortress, a volcanic island powered by the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic is shot down by one of it's lasers and nearly drowns underwater, but a current quickly sends him to his first area to collect his first 3 Emeralds. To do this, he has to get past the Pinball Defense System by using himself as a "Spinball" to stomp Robotnik again!
