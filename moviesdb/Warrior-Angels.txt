Warrior Angels

 A Female warrior returns home after fighting harsh battles in the crusades, only to come home and find that her home has been attacked and her beloved son has been taken from her. She sets off on an adventure to find her young son and take down the evil force that divides her country and restrains their freedom. In 1190, the knight Elizabeth leaves her young son Peter in England and battles in the Holy Crusades. She is wounded and returns to her village, where she is informed by the local priest that Peter was abducted by the wicked tyrant Grekkor and his army. Elizabeth decides to build an army to fight against Grekkor, but all the local men are afraid and she only counts with the support of Hunter and her bow and arrows; the prostitute Eve; and the gypsy Sybil and her powders and herbs. Later, the strong Luke helps them against Grekkor.
