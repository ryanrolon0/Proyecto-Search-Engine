The X-Ray Mirror

 "The interior of a millinery shop. A young woman who has been selecting a hat finally chooses one, and steps to a long mirror to inspect its effect. Her image is all right at first; but as she looks closer she sees herself as a ballet girl in stage costume. Her surprise is so great that she faints."
