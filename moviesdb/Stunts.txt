Stunts

 Expert stuntman Glen Wilson is called in to finish stunts for a movie plagued by production problems. It turns out that his younger brother Greg, also a stuntman, was killed in an accident during filming or so it seemed. En route to the shooting location, he picks up B.J. Parswell, an ambitious journalist who's doing a story on stuntmen. Things get hairy when his stuntmen pals are getting killed one by one during the stunts.
