The Uncles

 John is a restaurant manager who can barely handle his family. His brain-damaged childlike sister, Celia, can barely function at all even when she is not indulging in her bad habit of abducting babies, and his brother, Marco, is a slacker university student who's looking for an excuse to drop out even while John covers his tuition compensate for his own decision to leave school. The fact that he is having an affair with the wife of the son of his boss who's considering having his baby is not helping matters either. Tired of saving Celia from being arrested, the brothers decide to get her pregnant even while John tries to avoid the growing risky tension in his own affair. It is these circumstances that would frame a meeting at his boss' home that becomes larger than he anticipated and carries consequences that would profoundly change the lives of all the people concerned.
