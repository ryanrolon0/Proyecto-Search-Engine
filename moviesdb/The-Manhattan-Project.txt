The Manhattan Project

 The back office bathroom can be a dangerous place, especially if you're unfortunate enough to share the lavatory with the infamous Bill (a.k.a. the Manhattan Project). When Jim becomes trapped in a stall privy to co-worker Bill's explosive gastrointestinal disturbances (on a par with earthquakes, volcanoes, and nuclear winters), he loses a bit of his innocence. Bill's aromatic flatulence is only the beginning, a precursor to the monumental bowel movements to come. To make the already disgusting situation even worse, Bill provides a narrative to accompany the rumbling roars of his innards. Bill's commentary covers what he's eaten as well as sporadic exclamations of relief. Deciding to go on the offensive, Jim and his friend Ed discuss methods of deterring Bill's future eruptions. They draw up a list of rules for bathroom etiquette and hang several copies in the lavatory. Will Bill heed their advice, or use it when he runs out of toilet paper?
