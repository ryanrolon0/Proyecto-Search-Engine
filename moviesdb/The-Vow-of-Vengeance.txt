The Vow of Vengeance

 A cowboy's pal is murdered, and he swears to find his killer. The trail takes him to the Mexican border, where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful young girl. However, the more he investigates, the more the evidence he uncovers points to the girl's father as the killer.
