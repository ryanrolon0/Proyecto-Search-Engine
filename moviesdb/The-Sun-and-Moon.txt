The Sun and Moon

 When Moses is diagnosed with Alzheimer's his reaction is not like most. While others seek solace in family and friends, Moses distances himself from those he loves, as he does not feel he has the right to burden them with his disabilities. The piece takes place in the office of a lawyer as he transcribes the memory of the divorce so that as Moses's memory slips he will have the transcription to remember. Yet as Moses cannot decide whether he wants to have it written she divorced him, or vice-versa, and eventually reconsider whether he is doing the right thing.
