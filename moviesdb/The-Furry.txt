The Furry

 Larry lives life by the book. His 'how-to' books guide him through life, until a series of events turn his well-planned life upside down. Forced to find a new home, and pick up the pieces, Larry attempts to rebuild his self help-life in a mysterious house, but things do not work out as he planned.
