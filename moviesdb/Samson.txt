 Jacques Brachart is a parvenu in the finance, the boss of the African Coppers. The D'Andeline are noble but pennyless. They make their daughter Anne-Marie marry Brachart. A marriage of convenience for them. But Brachart is really in love with Anne-Marie, though she can hardly stand him. One days, she takes a lover, Jerome Le Govain, a dandy whose money comes from Brachart's advises... A fierce melodrama.
