Ranger Courage

 The Harper wagon train is carrying money and Bull and his gang are after it. When their first attack is foiled by the rangers, Allen trails them. But he is captured and his ranger badge used to divert the rangers away leaving the wagon train unprotected. Daniel Harper, with his daughter Alice, young son "Buzzy" and brother Joe are part of a rich wagon train which is attacked by renegade leader "Bull" and his henchmen, posing as Indians. "Buzzy" rides to a nearby Ranger camp and brings Ranger Bob Allen and other Rangers to the rescue. The outlaws flee and Bob, trailing them, finds a tassel Bull has lost from a glove and also notes some boot-heel tracks, and concludes that white men were involved in the raid. In town, Bob sees that Bull has a tassel missing from his glove and is sure Bull is his man. But, trailing the gang, Bob is captured, Bull takes his Ranger badge and sends a henchman back to the wagon trail to impersonate a Ranger with fake orders to lure the Rangers away from the train.
