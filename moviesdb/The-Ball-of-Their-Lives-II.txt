The Ball of Their Lives II

 The Helicon Ball - the largest of its kind in all of North America - is a debutante ball, organized and held annually under the auspices of the Hungarian Helicon Society and the Hungarian Helicon Foundation. Hungarian immigrants, freshly arrived to Canada, have started the Ball in 1958. The organizer's goal was to maintain the beautiful traditions of Europe in the multicultural atmosphere of their new home - Canada. The Helicon Ball is filled with elegance, excitement and ceremony. The evening begins with a champagne reception, followed by the Opening Ceremonies, which consist of the procession of distinguished guests, the Palotas dance - performed in traditional costume - followed by the most unique aspect of the Helicon Ball, the presentation of the debutantes. Hundreds of guests arrive each year from all over North America to relive the grandeur of this belle epoque.
