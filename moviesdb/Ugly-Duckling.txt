Ugly Duckling

 The duck's eggs hatched the rest, and momma duck chews poppa out. On top of it all, where the ducklings quack, the oddball honks. He's soon ostracized by all the ducks. He also explores a nest of sparrows and a duck decoy, but there's no acceptance there, either (the decoy bonks him on the head like one of those drinking birds). But just when he's feeling worst, a family of swans comes by, and he's got a new family.
