Regimet

 A controlling regime rules Norway with an iron fist surveillance and control of the population is in effect. Norway is no longer a free country and the people show apparent signs of large amounts of manipulation and propaganda. Jacob has lived his whole life, blind to the change in himself and his country. Everything gets turned up side down when he meets an old acquaintance, Mia, who is on the run from the same regime that Jacob has relied upon for so long.
