The Girl from Mexico

 In the first entry of an unintended-series that turned into a long-running series for RKO, Carmelita Fuentes is a fiery-Latin singer/dancer in Mexico City who has designs on Dennis Lindsay, an American publicity agent, for unclear reasons, while Lindsay's shiftless uncle, Matthew Lindsay, aids and abets her every step of the way to the marriage altar.
