The Milagro of Boyle Heights

 After a handful of tortillas with the face of Jesus Christ are produced in a rundown family-owned tortilla factory in the East Los Angeles community of Boyle Heights, the barrio is thrown into a frenzy. The tortilleria becomes a pilgrimage site until church authorities denounce the miracle. The faithful leave crestfallen, but the greater miracle is occurs when the owner of the tortilla factory opens her heart and finds her dreams come true through the act of giving.
