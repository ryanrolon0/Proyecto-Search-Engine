Sky Disk

 The film traces the realization of sculptor Howard Rosenthal's dream of a monumental outdoor sculpture. When one enters the "Sky Disk," a wooden, bowl-shaped sculpture, ten feet high and forty-seven feet in diameter that is completely lined with mirror on the inside, all that is visible is the sky, its reflections, and the reflections of the people inside.
