Stoners

 A documentary that looks at a diverse group of people who play the online game "The Stone". What is "The Stone" and what is it about it that draws these people to play it? How has "The Stone" gone beyond its original internet origins to become something even more? Is time really the answer? Does Madcap truly believe the mothership is coming? The documentary answers many questions and raises many more. It provides a fascinating study as to why a group of wildly different people play the same online game and how they have taken that game into the real world to form strong connections amongst each other that can be truly life-changing.
