The Apple Follies

 Apples of various sizes populate this stop-motion animated comedy short, which depicts an eager burlesque-house audience awaiting the tantalizing performance of a "saucy peeler." This Super-8mm film was the first "home movie" chosen for broadcast on NBC's Saturday Night Live, which solicited viewer submissions during its inaugural 1976 season.
