The Four Horsemen

 The Four Horsemen are coming and unless they are addressed we and the planet will gallop towards its logical final destination. Crises are converging when governments, religion and mainstream economists have stalled. Understanding we will never return to 'business as usual' 23 international experts who have worked at the highest level break their silence and explain how Human Beings must shift their priorities and be prepared to have any chance of survival. Looking at America, UK, Pakistan, the Sovereign State of Goldman Sachs and the fall of the Western Empire leading philosophers, government advisors and Wall Street money-men join forces to describe how we arrived at such an amoral mess and why there is still hope in re-establishing a moral, human and just society.
