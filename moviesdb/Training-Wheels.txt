Training Wheels

 Generations cross as neighbors Fred Nelson and young Bryce Spelling learn how to help each other in a time of need and perseverance. Bryce is struggling to learn how to ride his bike without his training wheels. Fred is preparing to live life without his wife of 45 years. We find courage and life lessons come from the most unexpected places... sometimes wisdom is found in the heart of a child.
