Squalor

 Beirut, 1977. As the civil war continues to rage between Christians and Muslims, Lebanon prepares to celebrate the canonization of its first saint. Two Christian snipers are camped out in an abandoned apartment block in the city's east. Solomon tries to decode the cryptic visions he sees in the residue of his coffee cups while Elias is distracted by a beautiful new neighbour. As reports begin to surface of Palestinian militants infiltrating their zone, Christian paranoia hits fever pitch and the line between enemy and ally becomes blurred.
