The Good Life

 The Beckmanns used to have more money than they could spend. Now it's all gone. The mother now supports her daughter off a small pension as they share a small apartment in wealthy Cascais, Portugal. The daughter, now in her mid-50s, never needed a job until now; she assures herself that she deserves more from life. Filmmaker Eva Mulvad observes their attempts at making ends meet, their hopes for the future, their malicious confrontations.
