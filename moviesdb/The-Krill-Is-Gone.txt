The Krill Is Gone

 Voiced by the incomparable Tom Kenny (Sponge Bob) with Jill Talley, "The Krill is Gone" brings comic awareness to the looming danger of man-made global warming on the fragile ecosystems deep within our oceans. As this ominous tale begins, our host -- the David Attenborough-like Plankton Emiliania Huxleyi -- introduces us to his undersea world just seconds before he is devoured by a ditsy Krill, who quickly sheds her shell in a successful maneuver to outwit a predator only to have trouble growing another. As the tour continues, Ms. Krill is breathless with excitement upon spotting a visiting celebrity, a tuna named "Al Ba Core" (who looks and talks suspiciously like Al Gore). She also moans about a massive invasion of jellyfish, lured to the area by the acidic water (which they actually prefer). Unfortunately, our charming little krill is gobbled up by an audacious large fish, who wise cracks that she lacks "crunch" as he disappears into a fishing net. When it's hauled to the surface, we see the dastardly source of the problem burning carbon.
