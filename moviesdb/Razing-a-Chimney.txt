Razing a Chimney

 "J. Smith, a celebrated Lancashire steeple-jack, felling a stack 160 feet high, on the side of the new railroad station at Bolton. At the opening of the picture flames are seen at work on the props, which take the place of the portion of the chimney which has been cut away. As the timbers collapse, the chimney falls with a tremendous commotion of dirt and smoke."
