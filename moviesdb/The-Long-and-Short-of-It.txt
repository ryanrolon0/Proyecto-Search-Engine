The Long and Short of It

 A bedraggled painter is in way over his head. His back hurts. His ladder is broken. It seems he may never be able to hang an enourmous pastoral painting. Then... as chance would have it, two strangers, very different in size but equally benevolent in heart, wander his way. With the help of a kindly little lady and a gangly good-natured giant, our every-day artist overcomes his dilemma and fulfils his day's work. Three worlds unite. Ranging from 3 1/2 feet small to eight feet tall, they finally step back to admire their collaborative efforts... What is revealed is that they have not been working together on a painting after all; rather, they have collaborated in posting up an unlikely automobile advertisement, which between the three of them none are likely to be able to afford or make use of because of their particular stature. But have no fear -- they are all able to take advantage of the public transit system. The grateful painter joins his new acquaintances for the trip home. The audience is left with a sweet glimpse of what life could be like if once in a while people took notice of one another and offered to help.
