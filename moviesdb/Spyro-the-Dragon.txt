Spyro the Dragon

 A young cute purple dragon named Spyro has set out to free his dragon buddies, after when they had fallen victim to the villainous Gnasty Gnorc, who has turned them into crystals! It's up to Spyro to recover their treasure hoard from the invading Gnorcs, and then confront and defeat Gnasty Gnorc himself. Spyro is a young, adolecent dragon that was out having fun until the evil Gnasty Gnorc decided to turn all of the dragons in the Dragon World into crystal statues. Fortunately, he overlooks Spyro and along with his new friend, Sparx, Spyro must free the rest of the dragons.
