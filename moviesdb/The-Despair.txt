The Despair

 Two drug Addicts, named Sean and Cliff, decide to leave a rehab facility, pick up their friends, and head to Cliff's Uncle's Cabin in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. The weekend begins as harmless fun, but as it stumbles on, more and more chaos begins to ensue. Each addict is faced with a decision. Will they stop using and live to get clean, or will they let the drugs take their lives away? The story begins with a man named Sean. Sean is a drug addict, but deep down inside, he wants to stop using and live a normal life. Sean is in a rehab facility with Cliff. Cliff is reckless and only really cares about himself. Using his power of persuasion and insincere charm, Cliff convinces Sean to leave the rehab with him and a group of others, and go to his uncle's cabin in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Sean brings along his girlfriend, Vicky and heads to the woods in his dad's work truck. The weekend starts out somewhat harmless, but quickly spins out of control when a girl named Christine brings out some crystal meth late into the night. The addicts all decide to go for a walk in the woods and stumble upon an abandon factory. The factory is an unforgiving place and Christine goes missing. The next mourning the addicts wake up to this news and begin to search for her. When they come up empty, they begin to use more and more drugs out of fear. After an acid trip in the woods, another addict goes missing, and the only thing the group can think of doing is using heroin to ease their minds. It is now a fight for survival and each person remaining must choose between getting sober and living, or using drugs and suffering the same fate as the others.
