Silver Path

 Two childhood friends head out from San Francisco one summer to see how far they can go hitching rides by freight train. Together they embark on a dizzying, back road journey through the Southwest, armed with only camcorders, blankets and a good book to read. The two dodge train yard cops and encounter a colorful cast of off beat characters on their quest for the perfect train, along the way witnessing a rarely seen side of the American landscape.
