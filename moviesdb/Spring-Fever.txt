Spring Fever

 a Paul Terry Terrytoon cartoon (production number 5109) in which Gandy Goose gets spring fever (the only mention of the word "spring" in this seven-minute cartoon) and runs away from home, and promptly runs into a fox, proprietor of a roadside diner, who wishes to offer goose-fricassee on his menu. Gandy's goose is about to be cooked, until he develops a sneezing-fit and sneezes his way back home. This cartoon has nothing do do with some MTK3 short with the same title.
