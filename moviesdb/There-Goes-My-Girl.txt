There Goes My Girl

 A screwball comedy in the vein of _His Girl Friday (1940)_ (qv). Jerry and Connie are ace reporters for rival newspapers. They are engaged to be married, but their employers try every trick in the book to keep them apart. With the nuptials apparently thwarted, Jerry and Connie are sent by their respective newspapers to cover the Andrews murder case in Bridgeport. Will the couple reconcile or will professional competition drive them farther apart? Tim Whelan, the tough managing editor of a big-city newspaper, is trying to prevent his star-sob-sister columnist and sometimes real reporter, Connie Taylkor, from marrying a reporter, Jerry Martin, who works for a rival newspaper. In carrying out his anti-matrimonial scheme, Whelan stages a fake-murder and diverts most of his staff from working on who-murdered-Andrews assignments to blocking a reconciliation between Connie and Jerry. Since Connie can survive getting shot and can solve a double-murder while wounded, it is apparent why Whelan doesn't want to lose her as an employee.
