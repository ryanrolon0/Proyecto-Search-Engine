Washing Down Decks

 We here present a remarkably life-life scene in the early morning on board an American Man-o-War. The jack tars are lined up for deck washing. A number of them have their scrubbing brushes mounted on long handles and are vigorously rubbing the deck, while three lazy looking chaps with a smile of victory which indicates that they have the soft job of the day, are playing a hose for the jacks who are scrubbing. The water effects presented in this picture are very fine.
