The New Modernists 9

 This open-ended series intends to introduce the work of emerging architects building on the principles of Modernism while evolving a new language drawn from politics, film, literature, theory and the state of the world. This film looks at nine American-based innovators and their work for housing projects, commercial architecture, private houses and renovations, across time zones from New York to L.A. to Japan and beyond.
