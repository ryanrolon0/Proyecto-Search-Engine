 Michael is having a really bad day. His girlfriend dumped him, his boss fired him, the neighborhood thug wants to beat his face in and he has no idea why. If you asked Michael, he'd claim innocence. And all the clues point him to his brother, Robert. It must be him. Robert is out to get Michael. But why? There is no reason for Robert to try to hurt Michael. Because, if you asked Michael, he'd see no motive. And before you know it, Robert's body is found lying in the hallway of their home with two bullets in him. And the police are questioning Michael. Why? If you asked Michael, he'd say he's done nothing wrong, at least, nothing that he remembers.
