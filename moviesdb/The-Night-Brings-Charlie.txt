The Night Brings Charlie

 A psychopatic serial killer terrorizes a small town. One morning the teenage Shannon Davis is found with her head sawn off. The following night, of all nights, the doctor's daughter Jamie wants to attend a party! The Sheriff organizes neighborhood patrols, but they can't prevent that the killer hits again. Maybe it's Charlie, the gardener? A disfigured tree surgeon named Charlie Puckett, becomes the prime suspect as a series of gruesome murders are committed with the deadly slash from a tree trimming saw. However, in a town seized by terror, Charlie might not be the only thing to fear.
