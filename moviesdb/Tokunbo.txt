Tokunbo

 Used cars are the dominant car trade in Nigeria -- they make up 80% of the cars on the road in Africa's most populated country. The Berger car lot in Lagos, Nigeria is arguably the largest car market in Africa. But it is more than a car lot mechanics, and vendors of food, drink, clothing, and DVDs. The film explores class disparity in Nigeria through the lens of the industry of used-car importation. Sentiments are given as for the appeal/preference for used vehicles over new ones, and particularly for those vehicles previously used in North America and Europe. A variety of definitions for Tokunbo (a Yoruba word) - in addition to diverging opinions about this industry - are offered from the actors associated with this business managers and dealers to barefooted mechanics and car washers.
