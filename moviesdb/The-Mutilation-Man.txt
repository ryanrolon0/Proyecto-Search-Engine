The Mutilation Man

 Ivan is a young man who travels a barren wasteland performing shows of self mutilation to small but adoring crowds. He is doing so to attempt to understand the cycle of child abuse he has been a part of. Through flashbacks and halucinations we see his Father murder his mother as well as the psysical abuse Ivan suffered. He must make peace within himself through a sacrifice of blood and honor. The Mutilation Man wanders the wasteland of Earth, performing brutal shows of self-mutilaton for the adoring crowds of survivors. In a land where most fear death, he fears life...and the memory of what happened to his mother and the brutality he endured at the hands of his drunken father. These two acts will forever scar him deeper than any act of torture he enacts on himself. But will he ever shed enough blood to wash away the nightmares of his past?
