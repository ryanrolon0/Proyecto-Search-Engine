Unreal

 Ashur is a new psychotherapist in a hospital. One day he takes over a new mental patient, Simon, from his colleague, Bryan. And Bryan leaves for vacation on that day. Ashur tries to help Simon; he talks to him & learns his past. Simon declares that he has suffered from schizophrenia (mental disease) for past 3 months and finally he was convicted to be isolated in hospital by judge 7 days ago. Ashur starts to analyze Simon's files, he found something abnormal about Simon, Sera and Bryan. Ashur and his colleague, Amiee, begin to investigate this case; they think that Bryan is probably a liar, if so, Simon could be a victim of a perfect crime that was plotted by Bryan, and Simon's memories for past 3 months are possibly "unreal". Ashur and Amiee think they can save Simon from Bryan's trap; but the worst thing is, Simon is not the only one that Bryan took care of, Ashur is now in the trap, too.
