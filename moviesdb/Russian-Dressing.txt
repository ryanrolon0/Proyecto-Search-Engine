Russian Dressing

 Bill Farraday (Ben Alexander) and his band head for New York and have to leave their pretty band singer behind. Bill writes and tells her they have jobs in a swanky night club but fails to mention they are waiters and not hired as a band. When she shows up they dress as Russian waiters in long beards to fool her. This was reissued as an RKO Headliner short on November 23, 1945.
