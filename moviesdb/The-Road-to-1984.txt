The Road to 1984

 1984 was not a leap into the future-but a look at the dangers already present-in Orwell's lifetime. The Road to 1984 intertwines vision and reality. It displays the passion and chronicles the career of Orwell--who warned us of what could happen if we stayed on that road--his road to 1948 and ours to 1984.
