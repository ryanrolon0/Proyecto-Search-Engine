Sins of Devotion

 One year ago, Paige Michaels lost her memories. Now she's enrolled in a ritzy private college, where her new 'friends' don't look kindly upon the daughter of a waitress. When she finds Devin, a misfit like herself, they begin to fall in love. But as her friends start dying, she sees a darker side of Devin, and begins to fear for her own life. Now it's up to Paige to find out the truth, and what Devin has to do with a past she doesn't remember.
