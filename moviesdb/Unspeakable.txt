Unspeakable

 Documentary about the underground artist Steven Johnson Leyba, a man who is a priest in the Church of Satan, a Native American activist, and an infamous performance artist. Leyba's unconventional life is revealed in a frank, personal manner that diffuses the shock value of his more startling behavior. The film documents the private blood rituals, the profane art, the performances, and other oddities but doesn't wallow fecklessly in them.
