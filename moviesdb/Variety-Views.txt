Variety Views

 While Universal's "Variety Views" series of short subjects varied in subject matter over the years, and the "Mr. Chimp" entries were usually scattered few and far between, they were usually well received by the paying customers which made the exhibitors happy,and anything that made the exhibitors happy made Universal happy. So this one (production number 1354) was shot back to back with the previous "Mr. Chimp to the Rescue" (production number 1353) and both released on the same date. Shorty the Chimp takes a vacation in this one. Yes, of course, the title says that, but wouldn't want to be accused of writing a "spoiler" by including more details. Tom Shirley, as usual, narrates Shorty's antics.
