Relentless, a video produced by media watchdog HonestReporting, provides Americans of all backgrounds and persuasions with the facts, historical perspective and balanced reporting to help them understand and contextualize the struggle for safety and peace in the Middle East. This production presents an eye-opening depiction of how the threat of a broader conflict could engulf the West. It counters the biased reporting of the news media and fills in the gaps where even respected news agencies such as the New York Times or CNN fail to fill. Further, the film presents a scorecard of who did what in regards to the Oslo Peace Accords of a decade ago, making us pause to realize just how much hatred and violence has existed since Israel's formation. Relentless questions whether the terrorist attacks that plague Israel and the peace process today will ever end if all that's being taught to the next generation is hate.
