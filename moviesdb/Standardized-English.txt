Standardized English

 George Bernard Shaw asserted that the made-up word 'ghoti' could be pronounced as 'fish.' Indeed, English spelling is so unintuitive and inconsistent that they have to hold events (spelling bees) all over the country to see if anyone can do it. Ken Glaser and Stephen T. Marchillo leave no stone unturned as they take on the English spelling system in the video essay 'Standardized English.' The subhead 'EENGLISH' hints at a new way of approaching spelling.
