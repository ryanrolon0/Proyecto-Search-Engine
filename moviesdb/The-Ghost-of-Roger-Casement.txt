The Ghost of Roger Casement

 Roger Casement was an Irish born diplomat who worked for the British government. He was knighted by the crown for his services but was convicted for his role in the Easter Uprising during World War I. When his "black diaries" were made public revealing his homosexuality all public support faded and he was executed and soon written out of Irish History. The diaries are now being subjected to intense scrutiny as possible forgeries and the man's role in history is being reevaluated.
