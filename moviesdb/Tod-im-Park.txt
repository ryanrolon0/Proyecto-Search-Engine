Tod im Park

 Criminal psychologist Hannah Schwarz was seven years old when she and her mother emigrated from East Germany to the West, just before the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. Her father Leo Schwarz stayed behind and had a successful career as a hard-line communist. Hannah has never thought to question this story - until now... After the sudden death of her father Hannah returns to her hometown Schwerin in the East. Here she meets State Prosecutor Martin Beus, an old friend of Leo's, who also tells Hannah about a mysterious murder committed just a few days earlier - a woman was brutally killed. Apparently the case had thrown Leo into a turmoil just before he died. While checking her father's papers, Hannah discovers old documents indicating that a women was murdered in Schwerin more than 20 years ago. There are striking similarities between the ancient case and the present crime. At that time her father was closely involved with the investigation, but few records were ever kept. Were the murders hushed up? And was her father involved in this perversion of justice - or even more closely connected with the case?
