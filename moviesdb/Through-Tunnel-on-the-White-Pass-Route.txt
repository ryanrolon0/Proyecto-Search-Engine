Through Tunnel on the White Pass Route

 From the pilot of an engine as described in the preceding subject, two of our operators make a fine film through a three hundred foot tunnel, 14 miles north of Skagway, Alaska. As the engine approaches the tunnel around an abrupt curve, Old Saw Tooth Mountain, snow capped and towering, is seen in the background, while below can be seen the location of the terrible White Pass Trail and Dead Horse Gulch, where before the railroad was built, thousands of horses and many men perished from fatigue each year, while carrying packs of supplies to the Land of Quick Riches. Through the tunnel we dash, and out across trestles, past the two operators who made the preceding subject, and around the sheer bluffs of blasted rock, where men had to be suspended by ropes from above while making the shelf for the railroad.
