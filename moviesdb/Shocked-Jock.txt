Shocked Jock

 A shock jock's worst nightmare becomes reality when a listener kidnaps his 4-year-old daughter and calls into the radio show to take control. The twist is that the whole story is a dream/nightmare. The kidnapper turns out to be the shock jock himself. The kidnapper is essentially the shock jock's conscience trying to teach him a lesson.
