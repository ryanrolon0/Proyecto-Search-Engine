The White Cockatoo

 Sue Tally waits for a brother she hasn't seen in twenty years to meet her in a French hotel. By proving her identity, she'll share in a $2,000,000 inheritance. But others are anxious to get a share of the money too, and won't stop at committing a murder or two. In a spooky hotel on the wind-swept coast of France, two bands of crooks are working independently of the other in an attempt to steal the inherited fortune of an American girl, Sue Tally. Along the way the heiress is kidnapped, three murders are committed, a girl appears in two places at once, mysterious persons roam about the old hotel at night and mysteriously disappear, and there is a hidden room without any doors.
