Texas Man Hunt

 It's WW II and German Reuther has organized local gangs to sabotage the beef supply at the source. Marshal Lee Clark arrives to investigate and joins up with local cowboys Art Davis and Bill Boyd. Lee has a typewritten note from the gang and hopes it can be traced to it's source. Investigating several incidents of sabotage, Federl Marshal Lee Clark('Lee Powell (I)' (qv))enlists the aid of Carol Price ('Julie Duncan (I)' (qv)). Local rancher Walter Jensen ('Frank Hagney' (qv)) and town-banker Paul Clay (Karl Hackett' (qv)), taking orders from Nazi-agent Otto Reuther (Arno Frey' (qv)), are the ringleaders of the saboteurs. Following some too-pointed radio gossip by the "Winchells of the Prairie" Bill Boyd ('Bill 'Cowboy Rambler' Boyd' (qv)) and Art Davis ('Art Davis (I)' (qv)), Jensen decides to have them ambushed, but Lee prevents this in a gun-battle with the henchmen. The gang kidnaps Dr. MacKenzie ('Frank LaRue' (qv)) to care for its wounded man, and murders him when he has finished. After the annual round-up, the cattle are loaded into a huge cattle-train for shipment. The German agents plan on dynamiting the railroad bridge, and have also planted a time-bomb in Carol's buckboard.
