The Show-Off

 The high school junior class is being plagued by the antics of Jim, the class show-off. At first amused by his cutting up, the class is getting increasngly frustrated, as Jim is starting to give them a bad name with such behavior as cracking jokes during a play rehearsal, tripping a kid at a party and deliberately falling off a chair. One night, thought, Jim goes over the line Juniors!" across the entrance. Outraged by such shocking behavior, local parents bombard the principal, demanding to know what kind of school he is running where such brazen acts of rebellion are allowed.
