The Yellow Wallpaper

 Charlotte Gilman's epic prose flows jazz-like in a stream-of-consciousness story of a young woman dealing with depression, a domineering husband & physician in the patriarchal world of the 1890s. The yellow wallpaper represents the family, medicine, and tradition in which the character finds herself trapped. Over the course of the story, the wallpaper becomes a text of sorts through which the character exercises her imagination and identifies with a figure who seems to have found freedom. The camera dances with the the main character in reaction to and in anticipation of her thoughts and feelings. This movie features an extraordinary performance by actor Aasne Vigesaa, as the narrator, who is able to move seamlessly through the many wild mood swings of her character.
