The Kid from Gower Gulch

 Spade Cooley is a singing western movie star that uses doubles as he can neither ride, sing, nor fight. When his car runs out of gas he arrives at the Bar W ranch just as the owner makes a large bet on the upcoming rodeo that will mean the loss of his ranch if he loses. Attracted to the owner's daughter, Spade stays on and finds himself riding for the Bar W in the big rodeo event that will determine the winner of the bet.
