Sam tiu

 Summer has gone to Hai Nam for inspiration, along with friends, Pork Chop and Bob. There, he meets Mini, who has been mentally scarred ever since her fiance dumped her. Summer finds Mini quite attractive, but her brother Man keeps Summer away because he doesn't want Mini to get hurt again. When Pork Chop is found dead after trying a wild stunt, Bob comes forward with information that points toward the murderer, and leads the mourning friends back to where everything began.
