Un air si pur...

 Set in Europe during WWI, a doctor and lawyer have converted a musty old mansion into a ritzy hotel and health spa. The chateau is inhabited by an eccentric collection of characters from whom the proprietors go to great lengths to hide the endless parade of dying men coming back from battle. Despite the owner's efforts, people in the hotel begin to die mysteriously as events become a surreal meditation on death, disease, and hypocracy.
