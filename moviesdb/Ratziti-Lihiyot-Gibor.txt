 the most interesting thing about this feature film about the israelian refusnik-movement is its ability to show the inner conflicts of the refusniks. in that sense the movie is not aimed to given an as-objective-as-possible kind of view of the refusnik-issue and the debate about it but to go back one step and show what refusnik is about besides the media image made about them.
