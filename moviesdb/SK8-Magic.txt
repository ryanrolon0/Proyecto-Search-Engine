SK8 Magic

 SK8 Magic is a family-oriented romantic comedy, which is set in a roller skating rink during the Christmas Holidays and features a skate jam that benefits Toys For Tots, with some of the top jam skaters in the nation. It is a story about Sara, a widow who owns an old, worn out roller rink. She is notified that the rink may be closed by the city so that the land can be used for a light rail station. Sara and her blundering, well-meaning staff move into full swing trying to save the rink, with one comical mishap after another. Sara's grandson, Michael, decides to get involved. He enlists the help of Mr. Nick, the rink's kindhearted handyman. Mr. Nick seems to have a special knack of solving all the problems that arise at the rink, and Michael has become convinced that he is actually Santa Claus. As the time for the skate jam draws closer, more trouble arises, but somehow everyone's Christmas wishes seem to come true. But even if he really is Santa, can Mr. Nick save the rink?
