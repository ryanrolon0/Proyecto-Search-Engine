Take a Cue

 Despite the school just having won an important basketball game, its students are more interested in one of its teachers, namely 'Charles C. Peterson' (qv), who teaches them in the fine art of playing billiards. He teaches them how to properly hold the cue, gauge the correct distance from knuckle to cue ball, and create the proper spin on the cue ball to position it properly for the next shot. He then demonstrates some seemingly impossible trick shots. Feeling the limelight has been unfairly taken away from him, Homer, the school's star basketball player, tries to thwart Peterson's attempt at making shots, while showing that he himself can make them.
