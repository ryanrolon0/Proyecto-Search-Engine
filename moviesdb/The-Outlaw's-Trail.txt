The Outlaw's Trail

 Dad Winters is the leader of a gang of outlaws. Jim Osborn, a lieutenant in the Texas Rangers, is assigned to capture him. At a spring in the mountains he stops to take a drink. While thus engaged, Bonnie, the daughter of Dad Winters, comes for a pail of water. Jim helps her draw it. On her next visit to the spring, she finds Jim there. Jim leads her to a seat, and there tells her the old story. She is surprised to find out that Jim is an agent of the law, and rushes immediately to tell her father. Dad Winters and his gang go after the Ranger, to capture and hang him. After a long chase, he is caught and is about to be hung. Bonnie has other plans however.
