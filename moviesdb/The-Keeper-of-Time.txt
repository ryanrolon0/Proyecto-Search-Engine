The Keeper of Time

 Tim, a child living in a medieval world, has been chosen to be the most powerful wizard of his time. Under the protection of teacher Udo and muscular swordsman Bullrock, with a beautiful, mysterious blonde woman Anu along for the ride, Tim travels to the Southern Castle to train under the powerful wizard Martirus so that he can defeat the evil wizard Tor, allowing the forces of good to reign for the next 500 years. His journey is filled with magic and endangered by the dark spells of Tor, who is determined to end the journey before it has a chance to begin.
