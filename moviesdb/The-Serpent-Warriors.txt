The Serpent Warriors

 A zoologist is called to a construction site that has been plagued by snakes. He finds out that the place once was the ancient headquarters of a snake-worshiping cult and that the same cult placed a curse on the grounds. Soon the zoologist and the workers find themselves under attack by hundreds of deadly snakes.
