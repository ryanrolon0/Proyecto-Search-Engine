Steamer 'Yukoner' Leaving Dawson

 An immense typical Mississippi River stern-wheeler pulling away from Dawson Wharf with all flags flying and crowded with happy people bound for their homes in the States. Including the private "pokes" (gold dust bags), the treasure carried on this trip was estimated at about six million dollars. The wharf is black with people waving and answering fond farewells. A parting in that country is strangely different from one anywhere else. Leaving behind a friend or acquaintance whose only capital may be the last hundred dollars to which you have staked him, you return in the Spring to find him with a mine worth a million, one half of which is yours. On the other hand, he may have perished in the long winter or succumbed to the temptations of a great mining camp and frittered or gambled away the prospect of an amount of money that would have satisfied you for the rest of your life. All these and other thoughts play their part in the farewells in the North. No better view can be had of this type of vessel, passing it full length close in front of the camera.
