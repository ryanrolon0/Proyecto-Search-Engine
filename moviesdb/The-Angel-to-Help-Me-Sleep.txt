The Angel to Help Me Sleep

 Eric DeLeo never did anything with his life. Although, he did leave a huge impact on his ex-girlfriend, Persephone Potter, by getting her pregnant a few years before and then leaving her to raise their child alone. One night, Death comes to Eric's apartment and tells him that he's going to take his life that night, but he's giving him a chance to fix a mistake that he regrets. Eric calls Persephone.
