The Middlemen

 A humoristic look at the intermediary, the go-between which have become a necessary fixture in Latin America. The film tells the drama of four farmers who confront the powerful potato mafia exerted by the truck drivers along the routes of access. They join forces to get a truck and sell their own products at the market but find middlemen everywhere... these are all played by the same actor, the cop on route, the truck driver of the mafia who harass them, the supervisor at the market and finally the middleman between man and God.
