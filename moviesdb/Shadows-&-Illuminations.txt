Shadows & Illuminations

 Shot over the course of 12 years in Bali, Indonesia, Shadows & Illuminations follows the life course of a older Balinese man, Pak Kereta, as he struggles with the continuous intrusion into his consciousness of what he terms shadows or spirits. The film documents his painful personal history of trauma, loss and exposure to toxins, and draws on his other family members memories and interpretations of how to understand his struggles and distress. Central questions of how to interpret his experiences, and to what role a psychiatric diagnosis and the meanings such a label entails are explored and implicitly problematized throughout the course of the film.
