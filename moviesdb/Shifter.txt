Shifter

 Shifter's life is a mess. His flatmates play "horrible un-music" and drink all the milk. He can't talk to his ex without arguing. He can't get his answerphone messages. His new flat is a tip, and he's having nightmares about killer rabbits - but it gets worse... The second digital feature from the Wellington, New Zealand based Gordon Productions collective, Shifter is a paranoid black comedy about how the world is really out to get you..
