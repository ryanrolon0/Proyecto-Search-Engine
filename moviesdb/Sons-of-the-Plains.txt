Sons of the Plains

 Separated at infancy by an Indian raiding party, one twin is raised as an Indian, the other as white. They meet years later and discover they are brothers. Together they work to foil the attempts of a white man to cause trouble between the Indians and the settlers. They then separate again as one remains with the tribe that adopted and raised him, and the other rides off with his white foster father.
