Training Across Borders

 An intimate look at the historic 2005 Training Across Borders gathering, this short film features 100 Aikidoists from a dozen nations in conflict, many of them from the war-torn Middle East. We watch as participants struggle with deep-rooted prejudices, using Aikido to forge personal alliances for understanding and reconciliation. The film is both a testament to their innovative approach to peace and an invitation to join them.
