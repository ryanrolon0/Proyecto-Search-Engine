Sylvia & George

 For nearly sixty years, Sylvia Gray sold furniture, army surplus and thrift at 606 and 608 South Elm Street in Greensboro, North Carolina. For Sylvia, collecting objects became more important than selling them. Sylvia's grandson, George Scheer, has re-imagined the space as Elsewhere Artist Collaborative, where artists create installations from the store's inventory. These new works aren't for sale either.
