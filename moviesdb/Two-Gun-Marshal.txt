Two Gun Marshal

 This compilation 'theatrical film' was edited from two episodes of the "Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok" television series, those being "The Slocum Family" and "Papa Antonelli." U.S. Marshals Wild Bill Hickok and Jingle P. Jones suspect the wild young sons of Pa and Ma Slocum of a robbery, spanks them and convinces the old man of the value of getting them an education. The second story finds the duo investigating a robbery and, with the aid of Connie and two peddlers, Mama and Papa Antonelli, they prove Connie's uncle guilty of the theft and several killings. Jingles, only witness to the robbery, protects himself by masquerading as a fat old woman. Not a pretty sight.
