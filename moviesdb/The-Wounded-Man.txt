The Wounded Man

 In 1884 Wyoming, cowboys JOSEPH and TOM struggle with financial hardship and the prejudiced attitudes of HAMMOND, their boss. But when an injured traveler falls into their hands, Hammond's demands only get worse. Abused and exhausted, the two are forced to make a choice between their own livelihoods and a dying man's final wish.
