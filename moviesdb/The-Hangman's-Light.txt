The Hangman's Light

 MayJune Jones (named because she was born in August when the doctor predicted May or June), whose brother recently hanged himself, and whose parents suffered violent deaths, is interrogated by police about the deaths of a documentary crew that came to her house in the "hangingest county in the country" (rural Indiana filling in for upstate New York) after interviewing "Long Necked Nellie," an old murderer who was pardoned when the noose broke at her hanging, seen as an act of God. MayJune, descended from that hangman and still in ownership of his lantern, replies quite viciously as they try to railroad her, or so we think.
