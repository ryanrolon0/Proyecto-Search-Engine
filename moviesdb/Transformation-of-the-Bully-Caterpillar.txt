Transformation of the Bully Caterpillar

 Harold was a bully caterpillar. He ate leaves and walked on the ground. A beautiful butterfly showed up one day and said, 'Hello'. She tried to mentor him into his transformation, but he was the biggest meanest caterpillar around, so why would he want to change? Then one day it was rainy and cold. The caterpillar was shaking with the cold. The butterfly sheltered him with her wings and it was almost like a hug. When Harold pressed her as to why she was so caring, she said, 'Because I am your mother'. Lo and behold, that changed him completely.
