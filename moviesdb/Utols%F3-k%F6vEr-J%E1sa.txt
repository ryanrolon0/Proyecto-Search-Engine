Utolsó kövEr Jása

 "Utolsó kövEr Jása" (The Last Fat Jasha)is a story of a legend. In 1791 the Toth family established the village of Debeljaca on the no-man's land between two great empires, Austro Hungarian and Turkish. Once there was a Road Inn whose owner was a fat man called Jasha. After two centuries all Toth family members left the village and dispersed around the world. The last one who still lives there is Bela Toth, a Renaissance man singer, photographer, theater producer, amateur filmmaker, famous stamp collector, great cook, European needle-point champion and cantor of the biggest Hungarian Reform Church in Europe. He just happens to be 6 foot 3 inches tall and 350 pounds big. The story is told through recreations of the 18th century settlement of the village juxtaposed with the 20th century way of living.
