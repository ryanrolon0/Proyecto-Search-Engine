Silver Lode

 Dan Ballard, a respected citizen in the western town of Silver Lode, has his wedding interrupted by four men led by Ned McCarthy, an old acquaintance who, as a US Marshal, arrests Ballard for the murder of his brother and the theft of $20,000. Ballard seeks to stall McCarthy while tracking down evidence that will prove his innocence loyalty to him gradually begins to waver under McCarthy's accusations. Dan Ballard's Fourth of July wedding to Rose is interrupted by the arrival of four men from Discovery. They claim to be U.S. Marshals with a warrant to arrest him for murder and robbery. Ballard denies the charges, and as their leader is the brother of the dead man he decides to make a stand. His erstwhile friends start to desert him until only Rose and an earlier flame, saloon girl Dolly, are left.
