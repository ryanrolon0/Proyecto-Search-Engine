Two Nuts in a Rut

 Hollywood producer Richard Lane needs a rest and he and his assistant, Gus Shilling, decide that Florida would be an ideal place far-removed from the hustle-and-bustle of Hollywood...and aspiring actresses. Lane's wife is not thrilled to have him that far out of her sight, mostly because of aspiring actresses. Once they arrive at the Florida resort, they quickly encounter the same situations they fled California to avoid, and Lane is in a very sticky situation when his wife follows him to Florida.
