Spanu kaprizes

 Latvia - a small country in the Northern part of Europe, Spain - a big and sunny one. Is it possible to have a culture dialog between these two geographically far away countries? It surely is. The impact of the Spanish culture in Latvia has seen to it that the unique talents of the dancer Marta Alberinga, the painter Dzemma Skulme and the flamenco guitar player Andris Karklins flourish to their perfection. The film proves that the interaction between the diverse European cultures and mentalities is possible and that it rather creates the sense of unity than that of aloofness.
