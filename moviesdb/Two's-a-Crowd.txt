Two's a Crowd

 A man named John has a present for his wife. It's Frisky Puppy, making his first appearance in a Warner Bros. cartoon. But it's bad news for their other pet, the high-strung Claude Cat, who is driven to distraction (and the ceiling) by the puppy's constant yapping. Claude tries to kill Frisky and practically demolishes the house.
