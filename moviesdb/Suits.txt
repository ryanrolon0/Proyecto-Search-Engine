Suits

 Along with a first rate introduction to Anti-Trust Law, 'Suits' is a master lesson in how corporate monopolies illegal predatory pricing practices, squeezing of manufacturers and outsourcing have played no small role in our economic crisis. Equally stunning will be their exposure to the hard ball legal tactics of the ethically challenged major Wall Street law firms encountered by a group of hard working American small business men and women as they attempt to seek redress for these practices in the Eastern District of the U.S. Federal Court. In direct contrast is the moral rectitude of a woman from a Seventh Day Adventist charity who comes to pick up the spoils of this multi-million dollar judicial fiasco which ten years later is still not resolved.
