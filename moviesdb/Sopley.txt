Sopley

 Sopley is an ex-military R.A.F. base, which was used from 1979 to harbor Vietnamese refugees that escaped their country at war. For three years they were cared for and taught to adapt to their new British environment. The camp subsequently shut following the end of the program, with the refugees now ready to commence a new life in Britain. However with some too scared to go back out and join the real world, one young mother in particular seeks refuge in a deep end of the base only to be left behind with her child. The film is set seventeen years later when a mysterious Vietnamese radio signal is emitted and recorded from the now abandoned base, causing a small group of military personnel to be sent to investigate the remnants of Sopley.
