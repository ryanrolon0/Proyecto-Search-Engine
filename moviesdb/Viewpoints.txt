Viewpoints

 Viewpoints is a mystery movie about a couple of film students who attempt to build a device that could potentially revolutionize the medium. But one day an important object that is required for their experiment goes missing, and through a flashback structure that utilizes multiple viewpoints, the truth of what happened to the object is revealed bit-by-bit, until the end when everything is brought to light. The experiment's goal is to increase viewer interactivity with films by successfully incorporating the human sense of smell into the viewing experience. Paul - our protagonist, a film student - winds up getting physically and perhaps mentally hurt when one of these interactivity experiments goes awry. Thematically, Viewpoints explores the notion that although we recognize their power, we tend to overlook the exact extent to which film images can affect us - and more specifically - our memories.
