Shadow Ranch

 When cowpunchers Sim and Ranny get fired, Ranny heads for Shadow Ranch. Later on, Sim arrives just as Ranny is being buried. He then sets out to find the killer that shot him in the back. Summoned by his friend, Ranny Williams (Frank Rice), Sim Baldwin (Buck Jones), rides to the aid of Circle O Ranch owner Ruth Cameron (Marguerite De La Motte), who is under pressure to sell out to Dan Blake (Albert J. Smith), who wants control of a dam on the ranch that is central to the town water supply. Sim arrives to find that Ranny has been ambushed; vowing to avenge the murder of his old friend, Sim takes up Ruth's fight and incurs the enmity of Blake. Blake begins to rustle the ranch cattle but Sim lays a trap and captures several of the rustlers and marches them pantless into town. Blake threatens Sim with a showdown unless he leaves town. Fat chance.
