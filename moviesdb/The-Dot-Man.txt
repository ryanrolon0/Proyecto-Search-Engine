The Dot Man

 Major Robert Atwood, a brilliant and dedicated US Army intelligence officer is commended for bringing down a terrorist cell in Turkey. Fighting in the war on terror takes an unexpected turn for Atwood, when he is falsely accused of murdering a key informant. His once exemplary military career comes spiraling down after his own government starts to believe that he is a mole working for the terrorists he has fought so hard to disband. Paranoia sets in, and with the help of his lover, Atwood attempts to take on a new identity.
