Shattering the Myth of Aging

 Why do we assume that getting older means losing stamina and energy? SHATTERING the MYTH of AGING documents the story of a 74 year-old man, Ron Chilton, whose life was transformed by becoming a Senior Olympic Athlete. In his early 60's, instead of slowing down, Ron became more active. Since making that decision, he has won more than 200 Senior Games medals. As the film unfolds, we watch him become a member of a thriving community of seniors, ages 50 to 100+, who support each other in expanding their own horizons through a commitment to healthy aging. This film affirms the power of an individual to defy aging stereotypes, reminding us that it is never too late to transform your life.
