Water in the Boat

 Ginette Schenk lives in the margins of the East Village. Her dog Schatzy seems to be the only thing she has and loves. "Water in the Boat" presents a collection of moments from their daily walk to the park. Days move slowly, autumn turns winter, as Ginette struggles to smile and keep herself together.
