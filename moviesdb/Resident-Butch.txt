Resident Butch

 Resident Butch is a political satire about the Bush administration and it's propaganda agenda. The story revolves around the students of Lincoln International High School (The United Nations). One morning on her way to school Amy (America), is brutally attacked by a classmate, a reclusive loaner named Ben (Osama Bin Laden). Her boyfriend, Butch (George W. Bush), a smalltime drug dealer, swears revenge in order to capture Amy's affections and loyalty, he also sees an opportunity to destroy his rival in the process. Amy is the richest girl in school and her family owns most of the town. She was once the most popular girl in school but has recently fallen victim to a terrible drug addiction (fossil fuel) and has lost the respect of most of her classmates. Butch goes to the school's Security Guard (United Nations Security Council) and tells him that Adam (Saddam Hussein), who happens to be Butch's rival, is in league with Ben and posses an eminent threat to the security of all the students at Lincoln High. The Guard reluctantly searches Adam's locker but finds nothing. In his quest to frame Adam, Butch finds an ally in Madea (The Media), a brash broadcast journalist student who is looking for a good story to start her career. Together they mount a campaign designed to distort the truth, spread disinformation and intimidate detractors of their mission to banish Adam from the school forever. "Resident Butch" is a fresh, innovative, thought provoking approach to an issue whose impact and magnitude are unequaled in the history of the United States.
