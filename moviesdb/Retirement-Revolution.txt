Retirement Revolution

 A two-part documentary that explores the challenges and opportunities of the 78 million Baby Boomers who are heading into retirement. As the first wave turns 65 next year, they're changing America's ideas about what it means to grow old and what it means to retire. Sixty-five is the new "middle age." Retirement may mean a new career instead of the golf course.
