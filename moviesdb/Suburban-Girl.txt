Suburban Girl

 Brett, a young woman from the suburbs, is an associate editor at a small New York publishing house, hoping to be promoted when, on the same day, she meets a literary lion, Archie Knox, who's 50 and who shows an interest in her, and gets a new boss, a dolly-dolly Brit. Brett is soon dating Archie, then moves in with him. He's charming, attentive, and gives advice. He also has a history - ex-wives, a distant daughter, a couple of diseases, and a photo album of former girlfriends. It's no fairy tale more) intervene, and Brett has decisions to make. Meanwhile, she's working with a writer who fears peanut butter sticking to the roof of his mouth. Is Archie dinner, an hors d'oeuvre, or a peanut-butter sandwich?
