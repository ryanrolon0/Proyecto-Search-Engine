Synonymous

 Having just emigrated from Israel and Palestinian territories in Israel, a Muslim student and a Jewish student experience synonymous hardships in their first day of high school in the United States. They cross paths frequently, they are in the same classes, and they experience a similar bias and prejudice. However, they do not confront one another until an act of violence on school grounds brings the two girls together. With the school's youth paralyzed after a school shooting, Lina (Muslim) and Shalev (Jewish) know exactly how to respond to the situation. Familiarized with the violence in their everyday lives in the Middle-East, they instinctively help the fallen boys. However, when the situation is cleared, both are left separate, possibly aware of their religious difference, possibly unaware of just how much they have in common as religious minorities abroad.
