Vacanta la tara

 An urban family and friends spend a few days in the countryside. During this spring holiday, they find the time to rest, feast, visit medieval monuments and even deal with some household trouble. Away from the madding crowd of the city, everything looks a little different. Nature plays a mysterious part.
