The Long Road to Gary

 A mockumentary based on the making of a zombie film. Numerous problems arise on the set and everything seems to go wrong for the enthusiastic filmmakers. Characters include an eccentric, French-Canadian director who wants to create a love story; a sunburned, vulgar, alcoholic producer from Hollywood; a conceited male star; a zombie with tourette's syndrome; and an inept crew that has been illegally immigrated from Mexico in order to lower costs.
