Territorielle udsagn

 What happens when you repeat an apparently common story four times in front of a camera? TERRITORIAL STATEMENTS is a creative documentary that deals with personal boundaries and integrity. Four women each tell their story about episodes in their daily lives where somebody has crossed the women's personal boundaries. During the shooting the women told the same story five times with three-four days between the repetitions. This means that the stories starts to slip and change.
