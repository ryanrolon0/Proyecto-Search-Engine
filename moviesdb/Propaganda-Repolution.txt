Propaganda Repolution

 Horna is a culture jammer from Barcelona, Spain. His new graffiti campaign "Propaganda Repolution" exploits his own image as a means to subvert mass marketing. With the street as his canvas, Horna steals the advertising monopoly from big media and connects art with the public on a more personal level.
