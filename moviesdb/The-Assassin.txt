The Assassin

 James was a good guy. Until he took a position as an international cleaner with a British Crime Syndicate. For five years, he's been a jet-setting assassin who receives $10,000 a hit. However tonight, he'll meet his match. His next target, Layla, is his soul mate. Beautiful, sultry and sophisticated. Will he kill her? Or will he sweep her off her feet?
