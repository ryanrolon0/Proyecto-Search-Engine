Sitges-Nagasaki

 Izumi, a student at Nagasaki University, has become friends online with Magda, a girl from Sitges, Catalonia. When Magda invites her to visit, Izumi uses the occasion to practice the language and visit some tourist spots, but she also has another purpose-to fulfill a promise to her dying father, who long ago had fallen in love with a Catalan girl on his own trip to Barcelona. After a lasting pen-pal romance, the girl suddenly vanished without a trace. "If you ever go there, find her for me. Tell her she was the only true love of m life, and give her back her letters." Izumi doesn't find her father's love, but she does find one of her own Jaume. Afraid to repeat her father's sad experience, now what will she do?
