Red Lady

 RED LADY The Battle for Your Mountains explores the story of a mountain and a town, Crested Butte, in conflict with a mining industry that can purchase public land for five dollars an acre or less under the 1872 mining law. A massive molybdenum mine on Red Lady at the headwaters of the Colorado River could destroy the local environment and economy and potentially carry its impacts downstream to hundreds of other communities.
