The Collection

 Director Bruno de Almeida and a group of New York actors and writers made this feature film from May 2001 to December 2005 under a collaborative project called the DV Workshop. Shot with a digital camera and edited on a home computer, these films were shown on the internet as they were being made, as a work-in-progress. The project came to its conclusion on December 17th 2005 with a screening in New York City.
