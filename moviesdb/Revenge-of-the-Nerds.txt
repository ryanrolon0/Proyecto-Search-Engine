Revenge of the Nerds

 "Revenge of the Nerds" is an unaired pilot based on the movie. In fact, it's pretty much a condensed version of the movie. Lewis, Gilbert, Booger and Wormser are kicked out of their dorm by the Alpha-Betas, so they join the Lambda Lambda Lambda fraternity. By the end of the episode the nerds have had their revenge. The only totally new character is P.T. Turner, their resident advisor.
