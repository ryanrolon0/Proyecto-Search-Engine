Tarzán en la gruta del oro

 Zan (Tarzan in some subtitled versions) helps the Amazons defeat two gangsters who wished to take over a sacred gold treasure from the women's tribe. There are extensive views of the Central America jungle, and several tough battles between the young Amazons and the evil pirates.
