Shooting the Rapids at Luna Park

 The boats follow each other in quick succession down the incline, and enter the water with a tremendous splash, going directly toward the spectators. The expressions on the faces of the passengers show how keenly they are enjoying the pleasure and excitement. The panoramic attachment is then brought into use, and a pleasing picture of the surrounding buildings is shown; also a very pleasing picture of the Esquimau family, who are seen playing with their children and dogs, while two of the Esquimaux are paddling around in their kayaks, or skin canoes.
