The Day After

 On September 12, 2001, south of 14th Street is closed off to everyone except emergency workers, residents and the press. The filmmakers join news crews on top of a building adjacent to Ground Zero where they meet a group of young people who were among the closest onlookers to the tragedy as it unfolded; starkly different behavioral responses, perhaps coping mechanisms, are exhibited by the filmmakers and their subjects. Passing rescue teams, destroyed vehicles a candlelight vigil in Union Square, the faces of the angry, matter-of-fact, numb, this is lower Manhattan the day after the World Trade Center disaster.
