The Arsonist's Riddle

 There's a man sitting at a table, his face and hand dirty from ash. While he is playing with fire, people are screaming; agonizing cries, like creatures facing death. The table is covered with matchboxes. This is not a human screaming, it is a matchstick! One by one boxes full of matchsticks face a horrible death as the arsonist sets them on fire. But one matchstick box is moving and its escape is imminent.
