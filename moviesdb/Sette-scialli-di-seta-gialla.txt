Sette scialli di seta gialla

 A mysterious killer is murdering fashion models by using a black cat whose claws are dipped in curare. A composer, whose girlfriend was the first one to be killed, overhears a conversation by someone he believes may be the killer, but there's one complication--the composer is blind and couldn't see the suspected murderer.
