Should a Girl Marry?

 Margaret, an adopted young girl about to marry a young physician, Robert Benson, learns that she was born in prison and that her real mother, a convict, has just died there. A blackmailer gains possession of this information and tries to make Benson pay for his silence, but Benson throws the man out of his office. The extortionist goes to the hospital where Benson works and an older doctor tries to make Benson withdraw his acceptance of a nomination to an important medical appointment.
