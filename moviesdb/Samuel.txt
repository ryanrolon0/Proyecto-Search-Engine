Samuel

 Three boys, three different cultures, three different classes...one journey for discovery. 'Samuel - A Journey of Discovery' is a trilogy of short films that explore the same search for discovery of life's spiritual significance from the prospective of these three diverse youth. Through their differences, we recognize that desire within each of us to find meaning and significance in a world of disorder and disappointment. 'Samuel' draws meaning and significance from three diverse holy books Bible, The Book of Mormon and the Qur'an' an, and draws on the writings of Oglala Sioux holy man Black Elk to solidify its message that we are truly all 'children of one great father and one great mother.' Be a part of Samuel's Journey...a Journey of Discovery.
