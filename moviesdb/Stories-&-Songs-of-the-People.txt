Stories & Songs of the People

 THEY CAME FOR GATHERING documents the first STORIES AND SONGS OF THE PEOPLE concert, which was held in Australia. In a time when issues such as reconciliation were (and still are) prevalent, this event arose from the desire to celebrate Australian Aboriginal culture as well as the desire to establish a cultural exchange between Indigenous cultures from around the globe.
