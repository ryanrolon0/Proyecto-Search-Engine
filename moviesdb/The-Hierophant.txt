The Hierophant

 The Phoenix police are desperate to catch a psychotic serial killer, dubbed the Hierophant, who is targeting Tarot Card Readers. The killer is searching for someone special, discarding those not meeting his criteria. With no leads and the city starting to panic, the police turn to Tess Abbott, a psychic consultant, to help catch him before another gruesome murder occurs. Are Tess's psychic abilities special enough to end the hunt? Or will the hunter become the hunted.
