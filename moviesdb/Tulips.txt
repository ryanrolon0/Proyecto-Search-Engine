Tulips

 Tuigi escapes from her village to the city after witnessing the murder of her parents. Fleeing from a sentence of ritual servitude (trokosi) passed on her by the villagers, Tuigi roams the streets of the city looking for redemption until she meets Bianca Everly, who takes on a fascinating journey to true womanhood.
