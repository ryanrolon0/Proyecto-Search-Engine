Sorrow

 In 1952, the U.S. Government's nuclear testing killed all of the good people of Sorrow, Nevada. Today, the sign in front of the town reads "population zero". The locals, however, will tell you a ver different story... When a car accident strands four young travelers in this desolate ghost town, they soon find that not all that is buried is dead.
