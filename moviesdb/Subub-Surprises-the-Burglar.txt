Subub Surprises the Burglar

 Shows a bedroom and a man asleep in bed. A burglar cautiously raises the window, climbs in, and proceeds to go through the man's clothes. The man awakes, pulls a lever, which closes him up in a folding bed, the bottom of which is iron-clad and fitted with guns and portholes. The burglar is dumbfounded and cannot move. Subbubs turns his battery loose, blowing the burglar to pieces. He then raises an American flag on a staff on top of the bed as a signal of victory. The bed opens up again and Subbubs goes to sleep.
