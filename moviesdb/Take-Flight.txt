Take Flight

 Gary Oldman directed a music video for the Jewish Hip Hop band Chutzpah. The video was shot on Nokia cell phones. What started out solely as a behind the scenes "making of," turned into a film about Gary's creative process. Much of the film is told from Gary's POV as he operates one of the "cell-cams." We are inside his brain, if you will, seeing the genesis of his ideas and then his precision in carrying them out. Watching Gary work in this way truly celebrates the spirit of Independent, no-budget filmmaking, where innovation and talent reign. Ultimately achieving a seamless creative flow, his playful, childlike freedom of expression and exploration take flight.
