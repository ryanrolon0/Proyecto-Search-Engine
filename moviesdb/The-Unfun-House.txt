The Unfun House

 The Unfun House is a not-so-fun computer animated trip through an unsafe, "legally challenged" dark ride. Life threatening props and zoning issues are just a few of the problems management ignores everyday. To make things worse a disgruntled former employee of the ride comes back to wreak havoc during your tour!
