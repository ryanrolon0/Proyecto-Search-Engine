Waning Solstice

 As the witch trials raged across Europe one inquisitors name was feared amongst all others Martin Del Rio. After tracking a demon and losing in a battle he summoned a demon into himself to gain the power to continue fighting her through the ages, then his journal and all the knowledge within was stolen. Now in the twenty first millennium his book has resurfaced and a girl without the common sense to not fool around with dark arts she does not understand has unleashed a horde of demons and their army of zombies on a quiet little town. Del Rio and a hand full of college students are the only ones standing between humanity and hell on earth.
