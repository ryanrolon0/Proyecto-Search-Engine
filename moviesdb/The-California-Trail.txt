The California Trail

 Santa Fe Stuart, leading a relief train bringing food to the peasants, gets caught up in the Commandante and his brother the Mayor's effort to starve out the peasants. Thrown in jail and about to be hung, he escapes and joins the peasants in their fight against the brothers and their troops... In La Loma in Southern California in the middle of the 19th century, the Mayor and the Commandante are attempting to force the peons to deed their land over to them by starving them and getting a monopoly on all the food and grain in the district. Wealthy aristocrat Don Marco Ramierz has spent his entire fortune buying food to keep the peasants alive. He is killed, but before he dies, he instructs Santa Fe Stewart to take the food to the starving townspeople and to trust only those who are poor. If the people get the food, the Commandante's plans are wrecked, so he has Santa Fe put in irons for allegedly smuggling the food into the province. Santa Fe escapes, unites with Juan and they hold up the Commandante's men and steal their gold so the peasants may eat. Following several escapades against the Commandante, while falling in love with Don Marco's daughter, Dolores, Santa Fe holds up a carriage that is carrying the province Governor in disguise to La Loma to investigate reports of oppression. Santa Fe and the Governor ride into town where the Commandante has put a price of 1,000 pesos on Santa Fe's head. They arrest the Governor, unaware of his identity, for being seen associating with Santa Fe.
