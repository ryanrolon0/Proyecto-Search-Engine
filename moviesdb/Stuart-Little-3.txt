Stuart Little 3

 Stuart Little's back in an all-new, adventure! School's out for the summer and the Little Family is spending their big vacation at a beautiful lakeside cabin near Lake Garland. But meanwhile, there is something lurking in the forest who could spoil all the fun forest terror who rules the local animals with an iron paw. When Snowbell is taken prisoner, a Little bravery goes a long way as Stuart, along with his new skunk friend, named, Reeko, who heroically rescues Snowbell, frees the other woodland creatures and outwits the wily Beast.
