Walk Right In

 Walk Right In is the story of a unique school from the 1960s where kids from poverty backgrounds learn about race, diversity, and personal identity. Through fellow students, teachers, and a demanding curriculum, they discover the shared values that ground people and bind them together, creating a model educational community which still resonates today.
