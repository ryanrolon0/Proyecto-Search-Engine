The Noonday Devil

 A girl taking a walk in a remote part of the country takes a walk. As she rests in a field she fancies that she sees a figure standing nearby her. However when she does a double take there is nobody there. She then moves on and begins her ascent of Zennor Quoit, stopping to pick berries halfway up. As she nears the summit she sees the same figure standing at the peak. After a double take she is unsure as to whether he is real or an effect of the berries and questions herself whether to continue. Having reached the top she is watched by the figure as she looks out into the sun disregarding her Noonday Devil.
