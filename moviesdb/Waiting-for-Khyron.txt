Waiting for Khyron

 In another of these intriguing series of one-off films, 'Waiting for Khyron' charts the birth of Dorothy and Jason's baby. The couple of one year, who are 19 and 2O respectively "planned, in a way" for their son's arrival & this wonderfully touching, occasionally hilarious film, artfully compresses the 24hrs before Khyron's birth into the same number of minutes. Suffice to say, Jason, in the manner of most expectant fathers, is occasionally useful while Dorothy does all the work.
