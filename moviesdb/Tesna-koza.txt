Tesna koza

 In this light, fluffy comedy, a low-level clerk cannot make ends meet because his brood is in no way economically cooperative lawyer looking for work, unsuccessfully; his son is a would-be astronomer who wants to spend his life studying without working; and his other son wants his own wheels. It is enough to send a father to the lottery, or to the soccer pool.
