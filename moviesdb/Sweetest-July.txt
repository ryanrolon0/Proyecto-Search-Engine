Sweetest July

 As a nonprofit and aspiring independent film maker, my team and I are students from Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak worked on this short film project titled The Longest Sweetest Days which aims of this project is to promote local independent film and arts sector and also tourism through the world of short film. The short film embarks on a romantic melodrama love story of a young couple who are sailing on the boat of self discovery where they eventually realize how much they meant to each other.
