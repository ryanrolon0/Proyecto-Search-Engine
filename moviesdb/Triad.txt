Triad

 University of Illinois students Carter Smithson and his two friends Angie Clemens and Jake Krups are finishing up their semester. Carter has just landed a scholarship that may propel him into high esteem in acadamia, but Jake objects to the ideas that are taking him there. In the meantime, strange occurrences are happening on campus. One night, out celebrating, they find themselves running from things that they aren't even sure are real.
