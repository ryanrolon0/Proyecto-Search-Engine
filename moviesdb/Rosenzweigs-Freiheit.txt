Rosenzweigs Freiheit

 When Michael Rosenzweig, a Jewish manual laborer, becomes the prime suspect in the murder of a neo-Nazi leader, his brother Jacob, a young attorney, takes on his defense. Set against a backdrop of historically accurate events, the fictional story of the two brothers explores the ongoing right-wing extremist violence that has plagued Germany since its reunification in the early 1990s.
