 He wants to elope with her, but her dad objects because she owes back rent. The boyfriend preservers, and through chance and luck, the lovers escape her house and land in his car. That's the good news; the bad news is that the gas pedal sticks, and the car races down the street, with the lovers hanging on for dear life. A series of misadventures and near collisions make it anything but a joy ride. Is there a soft landing anywhere in sight or will some other solution enable the sweethearts to join in holy matrimony?
