The Final Frolics of Mr. Bean

 Mr. Bean gives a new meaning to "Goofy Golf"! But first, he must find his lost trousers in the launderette.

Next, Mr. Bean loses his patience in the hospital outpatience. Next, he tries to take the perfect picture of a royal guard. Finally, he can't seem to get any sleep.
