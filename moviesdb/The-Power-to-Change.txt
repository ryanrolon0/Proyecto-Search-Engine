The Power to Change

 The oil crisis of the 1970s inspired people across the United States to develop a range of solutions to conserve energy. Produced during that time, The Power to Change is an award-winning film featuring eight such projects that, through creativity and collaboration, show that sustainable energy is possible and better for the environment. Led by individuals and businesses, both in rural towns and city neighborhoods, the projects include solar-heated barns and greenhouses, urban composting to reclaim vacant city lots, recycled wine bottles, and a wind-driven automobile. The Power to Change was made over 30 years ago, but its lessons are still relevant as we deal with environmental issues today. This film invites viewers to be inspired by the innovators of yesterday, and shows that we still have the power to change.
