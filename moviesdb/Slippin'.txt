Slippin'

 During an ordinary Friday night, we follow a group of teenage boys on their way to a house party that they never manage to attend. The main protagonist will be drawn into a conflict that will see him lost in a situation he has no experience or control off; which ultimately leaves him physically and emotionally humiliated.
