Snap Decision

 Single mother Jennifer Bradley often lets her young children run around and frolic at home in diapers, underwear or even the bare. She thinks nothing of it when their godmother Carrie Dixon, Jen's best friend since college, joins in and shoots 36 pictures of their rumbling. But the photo lab reports, as the law and the Bush era 'moral majority' prudish mentality require, reports this 'possible child pornography' to the police. Chicago PD detective John Collins takes the case. The children are placed in temporary custody with their grandparents by the court at Social Services' initial recommendation. Attorney Steve Godwin accepts to defend his friend Jen. The case seems to cool, but then Jen is arrested and tried for multiple child abuse.
