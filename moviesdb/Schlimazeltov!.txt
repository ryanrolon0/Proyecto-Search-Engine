Schlimazeltov!

 Maybe some people are just born unlucky? This documentary film weaves together a diverse collection of different voices from London's Jewish community to explore the concept of 'luck' or 'mazel'. From lucky charms and curses to global economics and quantum physics, this humorous and philosophical piece of visual poetry navigates the boundaries between religion and superstition to ask how the invisible hand of mazel has touched us all.
