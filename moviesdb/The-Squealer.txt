The Squealer

 A gangster's wife, fearful that he is about to be murdered by his rivals, tips off the police to his whereabouts in order to save his life. Her husband, however, believes her reason was that she wanted him out of the way so she could have his best friend. Valleti, a bootlegger who prefers no competition, has Charley Hart, his bootlegging competitor, set-up to be killed, but Margaret, Charley's wife, learns about it and tips off the police, who also have a complaint to lodge against him, as to where her husband can be found. Charley thinks his wife double-crossed him in order to get him out of her life. When he learns the real truth, sprays of machine-gun bullets begin to dot the landscape.
