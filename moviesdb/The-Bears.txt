The Bears

 THE BEARS critically acclaimed, pop music band The Bears. The doc goes behind-the-scenes with musicians Adrian Belew, Chris Arduser, Rob Fetters & Bob Nyswonger as they reunite for their first tour in 13 years. The cameras shadow the band for 36 hours as they wander the winter roads linking their sold-out shows in Detroit and Chicago. Along the way, The Bears reflect on the realities of indy rock and diseased meat!
