Wanderlost

 Drifter is a train hopping gutter punk, alone in the world, isolated by years of ritual abuse and life on the fringe. He returns to his father's grave to break the curse that haunts him. Here he sees salvation in a beautiful young artist who could be his key to freedom. But curses don't die so easily.
