The Lonely Trail

 Though he fought for the North in the Civil War, John is asked by the Governor of Texas to get rid of some troublesome carpetbaggers. He enlists the help of Holden before learning that Holden too is plundering the local folk. Ex-Union officer John Ashley returns to his hometown in Texas and finds law and order being maintained by northerner Benedict Holden's armed troopers. Initially taken in by Holden's smooth talk, Ashley soon discovers Holden is a carpetbagger who, unbeknownst by the governor, is killing and stealing from the locals under cover of state authority. Hoping to thwart Holden's ongoing attacks against the citizens, Ashley enlists in Holden's troops.
