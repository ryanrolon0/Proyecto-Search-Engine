Quiet Kill

 Amy Martin ('Claudia Christian'(qv)), an attractive married woman and a member of the 'Country Club Tennis Set', is being neglected by her workaholic doctor husband, Jerry ('Corbin Bernsen'(qv)). Lonely and insecure, Amy foolishly falls for the seductive charms of a much younger man, Steve Sterns ('Nicholas Celozzi'(qv)) who is introduced to Amy by her good friend, Sheila. The love affair is very brief, as she realizes that Steve has a dark, sinister and obsessive side to his personality, or is it personalities? Amy tries to break off the relationship, only to find that her adulterous lover has become her stalker. She also fears that Steve is responsible for the numerous brutal murders of local prostitutes. Two policemen ('Ron Perlman'(qv) and 'James Van Patten'(qv)) investigate Steve and also the killings of the prostitutes; but this does not stop Steve from becoming increasingly violent and murderous towards Amy. After the death of Amy's friend, Sheila, and the killing of her dog at the hands of Steve, the police still do not arrest him due to lack of evidence. Steve is now in a tormented state and kills his psychiatrist who knows about Steve's multiple personalities. He then attempts to murder Amy in a fit of rage at her house, only to die at the hands of Amy's stepdaughter, Milly ('Vanessa Lee Evigan'(qv)).
