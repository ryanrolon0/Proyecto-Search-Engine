Somers Town

 Two teenagers, both newcomers to London, forge an unlikely friendship over the course of a hot summer. Tomo is a runaway from Nottingham; Marek lives in the district of Somers Town, between King's Cross and Euston stations, where his dad is working on a new rail link. The boys are both infatuated with the same girl, and pass their days bickering over which of them loves her the most. Finding himself homeless, Tomo surreptitiously moves into Marek's bedroom - but it's only a matter of time before Marek's dad discovers what's going on... In the suburban London district Somers Town, two Polish-blooded knaves meet and strike an outsiders friendship, although of opposite character. Big, strong, well-behaved, somewhat shy and slow Marek is the pride and joy of his virtually separated dad, an angular construction worker. Abandoned Tomo is a bratty shrimp and incurable imp. Marek plays physically protective big brother, Tomo offers his dubious daring 'help' in matters of pranks and courting. Homeless Tomo even gets to eat and sleep in generous mate Marek's room, but without paternal permission...
