Rock Pockets

 A young gay man remembers back to a time when he was ten years old, attending the midway at a fair, seeing many straight couples walking around with their hands in their partner's back pocket, both usually wearing the tightest pair of jeans possible, as a blatant sign of sexual attraction to each other, and feeling incensed, even then, that he could not do that as a gay person in a straight world. Now as an adult, the sense of lack of entitlement still exists within him. As such, he asks a friend of his, a straight man, who generally wears the tightest possible jeans available, if he will parade around a fair midway with him, each placing their hand in the other's back jeans pocket. His friend agrees. As his friend is not his partner, will this facade be enough to satisfy his sense of societal inequity?
