Seemannsbegräbnis

 The bum Gas and the junky Sebastian comb through the garbage cans for useful things after the Christmas holidays and end up finding a dead baby. In order to honor the death of the baby, they leave the city to bury it in the countryside. A rubbish dump, somewhere on the edge of town the dirty containers for something valuable, without the pressure of time or any great ambition. Whatever they find, it brings little money; where they go depends completely on caprice-scenes from the lives of two drifters, homeless people who try to hold themselves above water with improvised gambling games, hard drugs and vague hopes of the next day.
