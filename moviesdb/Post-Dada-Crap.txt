Post Dada Crap

 A mysterious man is in an art gallery for the free wine, cheese and crackers and is totally appalled by the art he sees there. "Any one year old can do better than that with what's in his diaper", he says to the man standing next to him. Amazed, he watches as a red dot is placed on the label of a painting on the other side of the room and an art patron follows the curator into her office. Another art patron comes dashing over to them and is totally excited that the painting he has been insulting, speaks to her. "What does it say, exactly?" the mysterious man wants to know. When she turns to the other man to tell him she's going to her Porsche to get her checkbook so she can buy the painting, she calls him Lars, the artist's name on the ugly painting. After realizing he has been speaking with the artist himself, he is more curious about why such a rich looking woman as her would want to buy it, and decides that HE wants it. He brings out a wad of cash from his pocket, accidentally also dropping a gun on the floor. One thing leads to another, and he ends up buying the painting that he originally called crap.
