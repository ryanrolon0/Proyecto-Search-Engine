Scherzo

 'Scherzo' is a short story about human memory. The action is set in the park- Saski Garden- one of the few places in Warsaw, where many people have been coming to since they were children. During the WW II Saski Garden was bordered with the Jewish Ghetto. This film emerged from places full of unforgettable images of the past and from a deep need to remember.
