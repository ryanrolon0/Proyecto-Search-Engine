The Black Guitar

 The Black Guitar is a film about Aimee,15, isolated, abused and in love with a boy who she has never even talked to. In her quest to obtain what she really wants in this world, true love, she comes across a banged up old black guitar. Emanating with the mysterious power to control life and death, Aimee uses it as a solution to deal with her sexually abusive step father, bullies, and even her own mother. That power comes at a price though, having lost her soul in a trade with the devil to obtain it. She begins to change and decompose, eventually turning as ugly on the outside as she has become on the inside.
