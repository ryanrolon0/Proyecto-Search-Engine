Stirling

 James Stirling was once known as Britain's most original architect. In this video he tours his three major museums--the New State Gallery in Stuttgart, the Sackler Museum at Harvard, and the Tate Gallery extension in London. He describes his formative years, influenced by the work of Le Corbusier. Critics and colleagues comment on Stirling's projects and style. Stirling's brilliant career was brought to an abrupt halt by his premature death in 1992.
