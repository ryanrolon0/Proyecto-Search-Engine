Song & Dance

 In the first half of the program, a young woman, Emma has come to New York from England to pursue a career in hat design. We are taken a tour of her romantic experiences with her ups and downs highlighted in song. One man she is involved with is Joe, who becomes the focus of the program's second half. Instead of singing, however, Joe's part of the program is an extensive ballet, hence the title, Song & Dance.
