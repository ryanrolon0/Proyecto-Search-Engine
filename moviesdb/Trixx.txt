Trixx

 Riding high off the success of his first one-man show, Mistrial, TRIXX had his first big show of 2010, entitled Face Value and released his first DVD of the same name. Mid-2010, Trixx opened for Cedric the Entertainer and Mike Epps. The end of 2010 had him riding high off the sold out Trixx Another Mistrial show. For 2011, the anticipated release of his Trixx Iceman DVD and new podcast "Out of Control" will guarantee that the charismatic and savagely funny Trixx's talent lies in knowing exactly when and where to push boundaries and establish new limits.
