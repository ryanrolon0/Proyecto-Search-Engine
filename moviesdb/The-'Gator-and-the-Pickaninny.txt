The 'Gator and the Pickaninny

 This scene is laid on a tropical shore. A pickaninny is fishing, when a huge alligator creeps up upon him and swallows him. The old father, who has seen the disaster, rushes in with an axe and chops the alligator open, pulling the boy out none the worse for his experience.
