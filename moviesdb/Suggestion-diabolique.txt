Suggestion diabolique

 Relying on motion control to produce the most complex and dynamic film of a piano performance. The film shows virtuoso pianist AndrE Laplante interpreting a three minute piece composed by Sergei Prokofiev in 1908. The notable asset of this short film lies in its use of motion control to shoot complex cinematography. Motion control is mainly used for its stability and its capacity to repeat, to the micron, relatively simple moves to shoot footage which is then manipulated during the creation of the special effects it was intended for. In "Suggestion diabolique", the superhuman precision and fluidity of moco is engaged in the shooting of a single shot composed of numerous precise camera and lens movements. The complexity of movement moco allows goes far beyond the capacities of any human camera unit and had apparently never been used in such a way. Chris Landreth lent his expertise and immense talent to the design of Presto's camera movement which was created in a 3D environment and reproduced on set by the motion controlled camera.
