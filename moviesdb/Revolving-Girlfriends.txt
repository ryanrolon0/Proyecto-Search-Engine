Revolving Girlfriends

 Daniel Curtis; writer for the New Yorker magazine, has got the life. Successful career, lives in a penthouse on 5th Avenue, and the love of three women. All of which don't know the existence of the other. Daniel has a surefire plan they never meet. One is with him, one is at school, and the other is in transit. One day, due to heavy fog, all three of his girlfriends arrive in New York, as well as Daniels rival, Ryan Lewis. It's up to Daniel to keep everyone from finding out about one another while curtailing the sex craved Ryan, as he tries to make a play for any and all of Daniels beautiful girlfriends.
