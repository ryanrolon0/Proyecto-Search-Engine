The Sundowner

 He was done with his day job, done with the corporate world, and done with land. Jon Bendz had his sights set on the open ocean. For six years, this technically-gifted man handcrafted a beautiful fifty-three foot sailboat all by himself, with his dream keeping him going every step of the way. And for almost a decade, this engineer turned man of the sea found out first hand what living the good life is all about. With Jon's best friend, Tim Tomchak, featured in the film alongside him, and rare footage capturing some of the most memorable moments aboard the ship, The Sundowner tells the story of a man whose ambitions were set so high, he thought he could defeat the ocean through sheer force of will.
