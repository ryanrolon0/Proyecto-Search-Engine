Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour

 In San Diego, Sarah Landon is invited by her grandmother's friend, Thelma Shaw, to spend the weekend with her in Pine Valley, California. Sarah used to spend vacations there during her childhood with her recently-deceased friend Megan. While heading to Pine Valley, her car breaks down and Carlos, the mechanic, calls his assistant, Matt Baker, to give her a ride. Sarah knows Matt from her childhood and asks about his older brother, David. Meanwhile Carlos tells a sad story about their uncle, Ben Woods. He apparently used to brag about his only son, Johnny, considered by Ben to be the best baseball player in the Valley. On his twenty-first birthday, Ben's sister Mary Ann Baker decided to celebrate with Johnny but she had a car accident and the teenager died. Ben promised to kill David Baker on his twenty-first birthday and he dies on the day of Johnny's funeral. Over the years, Mary Ann becomes delusional and has a breakdown. During an argument between his mother and father, David overhears the quarrel and becomes a hermit obsessed in occultism. Sarah joins to Matt to try and save David's life during the the paranormal hour.
