Storm Catcher

 A renegade general (Robert Miano) plots to bomb Washington using a new top secret jet called the Storm Catcher. The only trouble is only one man (Dolph Lundgren) is capable of flying it. So they seek to put him on the run in a conspiracy that makes him appear to have murdered several men and stolen the plane. Then try to murder his wife and take his daughter prisoner. Threatening to kill his daughter if he doesn't help, he appears trapped. However, his best friend (Mystro Clark) who is the plane's computer specialist has a few tricks up his sleeve. Air Force pilot JACK HOLLOWAY is falsely accused and convicted of the crime of treason for the theft of a prototypical military aircraft. Enroute to prison, he makes a daring escape in an effort to recover the plane, clear his name and gain his freedom. A fugitive on the run, aided by the knowledge of his trusted friend, LT. Sparks, Holloway uncovers a mystery that reveals not only the individuals responsible for the frame-gyp, but a deadly web of conspirators whose far reaching influence is woven tightly into the fabric of the U.S. military. Dodging a series of dangerous encounters with his wife and daughter in danger, Holloway fights desperately to save not only his family and his reputation, but to prevent the use of the aircraft as an implement of war on the most unthinkable battleground of all... AMERICAN SOIL.
