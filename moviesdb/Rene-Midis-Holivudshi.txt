Rene Midis Holivudshi

 Renee Dadiani, a big city dweller, teaches video art in a film school but at the same time he works for a propane delivery office. He claims real men are men of many hats. In a film school he s one of the avid preachers of self-initiated absurd theory. He assumes that one can enhance the power of imagination by way of altering consciousness that, on its turn, can give way to new reality. Renee often observes the city life in his Handycam. Sometimes the characters of his footage are not only the real people including himself, but the imaginary personalities, too. Like Yahoos
