Waste of Space

 "Waste of Space" is a comically irreverent and genre bending look at the crew of an antiquated cargo ship lovingly nicknamed The Cosmic Cruiser. Captain Steven O'Rourke has succumbed to the monotony of repeated rock collecting missions and is now an alcoholic slob spending most of each day passed out in his quarters. Commander Roberta "Bob" Franz is a long time friend of the captain as well as the daughter of a high ranking fleet Admiral. She transferred aboard the Cosmic Cruiser a few years ago in an effort to get Steve back on track. To date, Bob's rehabilitation plan hasn't worked, so now she's covering for him in order to keep them both out of hot water with fleet command. To complicate matters half of the crew has transferred off the ship leaving only the inexperienced and cocky Ensign Al Cook, his jovial yet half witted helm partner, Lt. Dana Jones, and the brilliant, but deranged ship's engineer "Monty" Mongomery. The apathetic crew of an obsolete rock collecting ship are lead by their alcoholic captain as they have to match wits with an idiotic gang of intergalactic thugs who have inadvertently created a potentially catastrophic interstellar incident.
