Rumble Doll

 Award-winning journalist, Carla Kelly, facing a federal subpoena for protecting her terrorist sources, is forced to return to the small town she left years earlier. She meets Lianne Rausch, a raw and emotionally disturbed high school dropout, up against a charge of attempted murder of her unborn fetus by drinking during her pregnancy. Set in four brutal days of a northeast winter, the lives of these two women intersect and unravel into violence, mirroring life in the starkness of a small town in Connecticut.
