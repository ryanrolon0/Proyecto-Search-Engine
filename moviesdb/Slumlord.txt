 Slumlord is a narrative dark comedy short film that takes us on a roller coaster ride through a day in the life of Scott Roberts, a luckless gambler. Beaten and humiliated by his bookie, Scott has two choices sweet-talk his mom out of twenty G's, or grab his wife and run like hell. Scott comes across an opportunity for some quick cash, working as an apartment manager. Easier said than done. He finds himself protEgE to Kalis Muhn, a sociopathic slumlord determined to push Scott to the limit and beyond. Between a trial by hammer, man-sized "dog" graves, and a three-story fall, Scott discovers there's no such thing as rock bottom.
