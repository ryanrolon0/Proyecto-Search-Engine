To the Brink

 Mike beaten to death lies in an abandoned hospital, tortured to the brink of insanity. Tortured by past physical and mental abuse and by a psychotic nurse bent on hate. His perceptions are impaired, turning his nightmares into his reality. Mike's pain and drug induced world opens a doorway to his abusive past, when his is visited by his dead mother, bent with cleansing the room and Mike's soul using a scrub brush and bucket. His dead father appears covered in motor oil, seething with contempt for his gay son. Mike's worst nightmare yet is his nurse, Svetlana, who implements her own brand of physical and mental torture.
