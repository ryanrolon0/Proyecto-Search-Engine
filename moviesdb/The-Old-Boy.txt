The Old Boy

 At the age of 92, Philip Cardarople has settled quietly into a life of service to his bedridden wife, to his church, and to his community on Cape Cod. Philip lovingly provides his visiting grandson glimpses of the fulfillment that can come from a life of putting others first. Philip had coached a Depression Era baseball team to raise the spirits of those who had no work. He had seen Babe Ruth play for Boston and had served in World War II. His present life of shared humor and mutual respect has helped him continue to live independently. Emulating the examples put before him, filmmaker Matthew Cardarople finds a way to honor his grandfather and make one of the Old Boy's lifelong dreams come true.
