The Head Guy

 During a rain storm that follows a snow storm, Nancy comes to the train station to tell stationmaster Kennedy that he's needed at home to see his new twin infants. She promises Kennedy that Harry, her beau, will manage things just fine. Kennedy is dubious but reels off instructions and leaves. Harry's clueless. When a trainload of cabaret performers disembarks for a layover, Harry joins a rehearsing chorus line; Nancy sees him with these immoral women, so she declares she'll never speak to him again. While he cries in his lunch, she puts her morals and her skirt aside to join the rehearsal. When the train pulls away, will she leave Harry in the lurch?
