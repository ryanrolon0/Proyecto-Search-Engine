Romance of the Rio Grande

 Wealthy and respected rancher Don Fernando de Vega fears for the future of his ranch after his death and sends for his grandson, Carlos Hernandez. Carlos is waylaid on his journey and seriously wounded. The famous bandit, the Cisco Kid, discovers that he is an exact double for the wounded Carlos. Cisco decides to "inherit" the ranch himself, and passes himself off as the long-awaited Carlos. But he discovers that Don Fernando's ostensibly loyal nephew Ricardo is plotting to inherit the ranch himself, and the attack on Carlos was Ricardo's first attempt to do so. Now Ricardo faces a healthy and unwounded "Carlos," and the Cisco Kid comes to respect the ailing Don Fernando so much that he considers saving the ranch not for himself but for Don Fernando's intended heir.
