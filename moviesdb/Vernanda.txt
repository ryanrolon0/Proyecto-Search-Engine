Vernanda

 A passenger steps off his train during a short stop in a small town called Vernanda in order to buy a loaf of bread. However, the train departs early and the passenger is left to deal with a bread-shaped bomb, strangely behaving townsfolk and an ominous laughter that follows him wherever he goes.
