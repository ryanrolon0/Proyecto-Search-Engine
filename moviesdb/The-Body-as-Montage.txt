The Body as Montage

 A mediation on French philosopher Michel Foucault's consideration of state, military, and corporate subjugation, control, and punishment of the (female) body. Through a critique of Cartesian dualism, the (female) body (and gender construction) is examined as a means to a political outcome. This experimental docu-narrative 're-maps' the interior and exterior (female) body and 're-imagines' its corporeality and psyche drawn from Lacan's notion of an inter-flowing three-dimensional Mobius strip. This model allows a way to consider the body's surface and interior as representative of its true nature and strength, which arises from the torsion that exists between the two.
