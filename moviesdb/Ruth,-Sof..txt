Ruth decides not to call for help, leading for her death. Ruth makes a pact with Mazal, the only other sane person at the ward, hoping they both won't end up like the "cacti people" around them. Ruth is an elderly woman, a holocaust survivor, who lives in a geriatric ward. Her life is not exactly LIFE, as we know it. In contrast to her declining physical condition, her mental condition is excellent, a fact that makes her staying at the ward even worse. Ruth has a name for those around her who reflect the worst possible condition - the "cacti" (Cactus); those who are mentally catatonic, but their body can last for long by being manually fed and changed by the staff. One night her "cactus" room-mate begins to suffocate. Ruth makes the choice not to call for help, eventually leading to her room-mate's death. Ruth collects pills and keeps them in a secret box. Ruth lets Mazal, her new room-mate and the only other sane person at the ward, to see her pills box whereabouts. After being humiliated by the geriatric staff and facing her body's shortfall, Ruth makes a pact with Mazal, hoping they both will not end up like the "cacti" around them. As we all know, pacts are hard to keep.
