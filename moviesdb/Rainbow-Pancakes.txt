 This is the story of the young and wondrous Benjamin Buckley as he turns 8 years old on Valentine's day. Although not at all what he expected, the experience turns out to be the best birthday of his life. Benjamin's encounters along the way remind us all how blissful it once was to be innocent and in the end we understand why losing our innocence is the only way we truly learn to love others.
