Shaitaan

 After the brutal deaths of Kanta Mirchandani and Sabrina, Bombay's Police Commissioner concludes it to be the work of a serial killer and assigns this case to Inspector Ashok, who lives with his widowed mother, Radha, and is in love with Nisha, a Journalist, and the sister of Advocate Munish. Evidence leads Ashok to suspect that Munish is the killer, and he is all set to arrest him. Then Shabnam, a Courtesan, comes forward and claims that she was attacked by a maniac, but managed to escape and assists the police to prepare a hand-drawn sketch. Hoping to have her positively identify Munish as the killer, Ashok finds the tables turned against him when Shabnam identifies him, not Munish, as her assailant.
