Project Slasher

 Project Slasher is the first of its kind "Choose Your Own Adventure" for horror fans. No more sitting back and watching the dumb blond girl stumble through the woods looking for her boyfriend. No. We get it. You're bored with that. So what could be better than not just watching a horror film, but being part of it? That's what Project Slasher is all about. Walk alongside Janelle as her normal day turns upside down. But this time, don't just watch her suffer, join the action and make your own choices as to where she should go and what she should do. Come on. You deserve it. After years of watching overplayed horror films, it's time you had a say. She Lives. She Dies. You Choose.
