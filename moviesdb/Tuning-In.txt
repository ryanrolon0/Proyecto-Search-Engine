Tuning In

 One morning a mysterious radio turns up on the doorstep of John Butcher. There is no sign or clue of who has left this gift for him. A short time later the radio springs to life on its own. The other worldly radio does not have the ability to tune into radio stations but instead it tunes into people that he knows which bring about some shocking revelations. Listening in to the conversations of people that he has been rather horrid to the last five years since his wife has died leads John Butcher to confront himself with the person he has become. With these insights John Butcher converts himself overnight into a better person.
