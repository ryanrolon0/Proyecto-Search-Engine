Treasure Diversity

 Treasure Diversity, a compelling short documentary, invites viewers to understand better persons who look or act different, persons whose abilities are diverse, persons who are autistic. Building off the seminal words of Martin Luther King, Jr., the film first explores the discrimination evoked when any group is labeled by others as being inferior. The film interviews autistic society members about the discrimination they have received and their hopes for a more inclusive and tolerant society. The film places autistic self-advocacy squarely in the light of disability self-advocacy and human rights. "It's not being normal that's important - it's learning to accept our being different."
