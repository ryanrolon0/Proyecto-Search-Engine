The Case of Majella McGinty

 Eight year old Majella puts 2 and 2 together and gets 5 when her innocent game of Charlie's Angels spills over into what she imagines to be an elaborate real life murder case. She takes refuge in her small red suitcase for hours on end when life gets too complicated in 1970's Derry, Northern Ireland.
