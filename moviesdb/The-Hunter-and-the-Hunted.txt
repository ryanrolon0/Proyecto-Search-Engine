The Hunter and the Hunted

 Nazi war crimes and criminals, their whereabouts, and the Nazi hunters who sought their arrest and prosecution. This was originally commissioned by the Australian Seven Network and filmed on location in Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, France, Germany, Israel and the UK. A 58-minute version of the film was telecast on PBS. For his work as producer-correspondent, William Bemister won the 1981 Emmy for 'Outstanding Investigative Journalism' on US national network television. Included in the film were scenes identifying the whereabouts of two of the most wanted Nazi war criminals, Klaus Barbie and Walter Rauff. Surreptitiously filmed footage of these men, and an interview with Adolf Eichmann's son, who controversially discusses the case against his father, won wide acclaim in the international media.
