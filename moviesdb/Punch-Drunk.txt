Punch Drunk

 Punch Drunk tells the story of 'Joe Sparro' an elderly man who suffers from Dementia Pugilistica, a condition otherwise known as 'Punch Drunk'. With the rising costs of aged care due to privatisation Joe is forced out of what has been his home for many years. He is released back into a new society, one that he is forced to come to terms with when returning to live with his wife. The years being medicated and institutionalised have taken a toll, battling just to grasp daily life. Although it is this battle of remembering that may just save his life.
