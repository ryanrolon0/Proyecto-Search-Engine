The Great Fogo Island Punt Race

 On August 13th 2007, ten rowing teams from a clutch of islands in Atlantic Canada made history when they faced the open sea in the first race of its kind. But the centuries of boat building tradition behind their wooden punts are in danger. Modern materials and the retreating number of old school builders are threatening the very survival of the humble wooden punt. The teams are not just in a race of endurance - they are in a race against time; to save the wooden boat building tradition from disappearing from the islands forever.
