Torture Money

 Dramatizes elaborate insurance scams, involving drivers, victims, and witnesses who stage accidents under the direction of an attorney who then files suit and settles out of court. The operation is easy to move from one city or state to another. The police and DA get wise and a cop goes undercover, first pretending to be in a coma in the hospital room of one of the "accident victim," then working as an orderly with a police record. The gang enlists him, he draws the short straw, and he's sent into a doctor's office to get his pre-accident injuries. Dangerous work. Will it succeed without serous injury?
