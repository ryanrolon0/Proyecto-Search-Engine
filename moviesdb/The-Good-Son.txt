The Good Son

 The Good Son is the true story of a young Egyptian boy who is asked to translate for his father as CSIS (Canadian Securities and Intelligence Services) officers question him in their home. Slowly, the questions become more and more hostile, and what started out as an interview, strategically turns into an interrogation. Ultimately, the boy, Ahmad, is forced to tell his father that if he does not comply with the officers, that he will be arrested and detained by the Canadian government.
