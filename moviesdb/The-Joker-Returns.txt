The Joker Returns

 From the dark and dreary confines of prolonged incarceration, The Joker returns with yet another crazy-minded agenda. This time, The Joker (played by Matt Cinquanta) has a message for those who contemplate the story's end... or it's new beginning. Hell bent on continuing his maniacal ways, The Joker makes it clear that he wants to 'do things' his way, and that no one can keep him locked up forever!
