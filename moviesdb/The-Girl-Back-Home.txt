 Ralph Williams, a young miner, is the most popular man in the camp. It was not his fault that Bernice fell desperately in love with him, and when Madge showed her affection too openly, he had not the heart to repulse her. It all ended in a shooting affray, and a letter found on his body indicated that a girl back home had played the leading role in the tragedy that cost his life.
