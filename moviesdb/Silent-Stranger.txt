Silent Stranger

 Texas in 1874 was a beautiful, wild and open country with no fences, boundaries or anything to limit a man's travels. This is about a man working his way through the Hill Country with nothing but his 50 caliber Sharps rifle, a riding mule and pack mule. Nothing to tie him down. You never know what may be waiting on the other side of the hill. There may be a friend or a potential enemy. In the 1870's you had to be prepared for anything. He knows how to deal with the wild animals and rough men but is he ready for Curly?
