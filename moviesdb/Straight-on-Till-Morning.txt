Straight on Till Morning

 STORY SYNOPSIS to take over the lives of all his friends in his small New England town, David Dupree sets off on an epic journey across the country seeking success as a musician in Los Angeles. When he meets the spunky free-spirited Kaitlin Sanbourne along the way, his new found liberation gives him the courage to invite her to join him, and she accepts. What follows is an exciting road romance as the star crossed pair get to know each other in both playful and intimate ways. But there will be no happily ever after for the duo. During a pit stop at a road side diner, their car is sabotaged and they are lured to the isolated desert home of the friendly mechanic, Rubin Robinson, who comes to their aid. But as it turns out, the mechanic and his family are far from friendly. David and Kaitlin are drugged and tied up in the attic. Little by little the Robinson's sinister plan begins to unfold, and David and Kaitlin are forced to fight for their lives (and sanity) as the deranged family prepares for a macabre wedding involving their deformed son Virgil and his chosen bride, Kaitlin. This is not the first time Virgil has chosen a bride, and it didn't work out well for the others...
