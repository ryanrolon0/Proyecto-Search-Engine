Politics of the Heart

 In 2002, the Quebec National Assembly voted unanimously to extend the same parenting rights to homo-parental families as heterosexual parents, providing the recognition of homosexuals' filiation right, before the recognition of same-sex marriage. Politics of the Heart is a moving portrait of lesbian and gay families who re-shaped the cultural and political landscape of Quebec by fighting for recognition of their relationships and their families.
