Unleashed

 Imagine a day when dog lovers unleash their creativity, and their obsession, on the world. This is California's Big Dog Parade. UNLEASHED takes us behind-the-scenes at this zany showdown where dog-owners dream up theatrical floats and costumes. Contenders compete for prizes ranging from luxurious getaways to free dog food-- but mostly it's about bizarre bragging rights, boundless creativity, and the extraordinary kinship between people and their dogs. Through the stories of a few devoted competitors, the film reveals a commitment that extends far beyond the time and money poured into this event. For many, the dedication began when they rescued their pup from a shelter or an abusive owner. There are others who nurse disabled dogs, caring for them as they would a relative. Each relationship is unique, intense, and full of surprises. These are the stories that take us beyond the parade and into the heart of a nation that has clearly gone to the dogs.
