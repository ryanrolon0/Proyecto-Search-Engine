Rushing

 College freshman, Justin McCrain, approaches the fraternity Rho Phi Theta on the first day of school. From there he is cast into a world of comedic absurdity; toothbrush scrubbing of floors, beer chugging contests, and tribal hazing drive him to the brink. This way of life conflicts with the pressures of his father, a love interest Amanda, and his school work. Will Justin complete the rushing process? This film puts the audience in the shoes of a young man trying to find his way in a completely new environment. A great ensemble cast communicates the ideas and pressures of college life alongside a hilarious musical chorus.
