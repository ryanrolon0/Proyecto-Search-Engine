The Burning Cross

 Johnny, who is a returning veteran unable to adjust to his old life in his home town, succumbs to the pitch of a Ku Klux Klan organizer. It is only after he has worn the Klan sheet, and gone out on some raids, that he begins to realize what he has let himself in for; he is filled with horror and remorse when he sees the homes of neighbors burned, an old friend who defies the Klan killed, and his own wheel-chair father badly beaten. He meets with the State prosecutor, admits his own participation, and agrees to help bring down the Klan in his town.
