The Crustacean Crisis

 Cooking a fancy dinner for a hot date, a timid young guy doesn't have the heart to drop a lobster into boiling water, so he enlists his stoner roommate to help kill it more humanely, leading to a series of mishaps and mayhem as they race to kill the lobster before his date arrives.
