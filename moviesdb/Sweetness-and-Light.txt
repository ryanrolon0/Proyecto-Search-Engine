Sweetness and Light

 Four average people with diverse scientific and spiritual backgrounds discuss the ways science and religion have affected their lives, and how they have achieved a personal balance between the two supposedly warring sides. By giving a voice to the often unheard peaceful side of the science wars, Sweetness and Light presents a whimsical look at scientists as human beings, seeking solutions to the problem rather than ways to win the war.
