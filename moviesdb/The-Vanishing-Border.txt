The Vanishing Border

 THE VANISHING BORDER is a fascinating exploration of the death strip that surrounded former West Berlin. What do those who live there remember after the fall of the wall? Many incredible but authentic stories ?about the cakes for a birthday party on 13 August 1961. ?about the consequences of kissing by the Brandenburg gate. Materials from formerly classified documents of the NVA, private images, stories and anecdotes of residents of the border present a multi-facetted picture of the world's once most perfect border security system.
