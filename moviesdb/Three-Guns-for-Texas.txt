Three Guns for Texas

 Our heroes, Texas Rangers based in Laredo, are joined by a pompous and persnickity constable who plans to civilize and modernize law enforcement in Texas according to methods he's developed in nine years of law enforcement in New Hampshire. He accompanies them on an adventure in which they encounter the wily outlaw, Linda Littletrees. They lose Linda, but they do get rid of the constable only to be joined by an old friend of Reese's, a man who believes himself to be a jinx--with some reason. They set out again to capture Linda, but Linda gets a look at Joe with his shirt off and falls in love. She has him captured and tied up so she can marry him, and the other Rangers must rescue him. Joe escapes unscathed and Cletus breaks his jinx, but Linda eludes capture once more.
