The President's Carriage

 We have just received from our operators accompanying President Roosevelt on his great tour of the Pacific Coast, a splendid series of films covering his reception in San Francisco. The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows mounted escort, passing up Market Street. A good picture of the President, and a spirited subject throughout.
