Rejouer

 Released from prison for lack of evidence in the death of his wife Chloe, musician Cain Nowak tries to move on with his life. However, Cain is still haunted by memories of how meeting music producer Nick Rose led to his wife's death, instead of his "big break." While drinking away his sorrows, Cain happens across the murder of a pregnant woman. The next day, Cain awakens to find himself in the very same prison cell from the day before. Unable to comprehend why he's reliving the same day over while everyone else is living it for the first time, Cain takes refuge in a bar, only to discover two men plotting the murder of the pregnant woman that very night. Recognizing he is trapped in an endless "time loop" but retaining information, Cain decides to intervene and stop the murder. As each attempt to save her life is thwarted, Cain's commitment escalates to the point of costing him his own life. However, even death cannot stop the day from repeating until Cain figures out why the murder of a stranger helps him move past the death of his own wife.
