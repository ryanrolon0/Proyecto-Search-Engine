Tex leaves town with the Custer sheriff in hot pursuit but doesn't know the sheriff only wants to give him a letter. Tex is joined by the self-proclaimed trouble-seeking trouble busters Skinny Cassidy and Windy Wallace and the three ride to Placerville, where Big Bill Jarvis is drunkenly breaking up the saloon.
