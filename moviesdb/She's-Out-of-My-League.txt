She's Out of My League

 Kirk is an average Joe who works as a TSA agent at the Pittsburgh airport with his friends. The status quo of his fairly monotonous life ends when he meets Molly, a smart, kind and gorgeous blonde. Because she's way out of his league (she's a hard 10 and he is but a 5), Kirk knows there's no way on earth she's ever going to fall for him. Or is there...? Kirk is a nice guy, who finishes last. He's an airport security guard in Pittsburgh, his ex-girlfriend hangs out at his parents' house with her new guy, he's out of shape and uncoordinated, and his car's a junker. At the airport, he finds the phone of a stunning, successful blonde, Mollie, and when he returns it, she offers dinner as thanks. She enjoys his company - he's unassuming and safe - and he's dazzled. His three friends warn him that she's out of his league and offer bad advice; he knows it will end soon and stumbles through a series of embarrassing moments. His ex has gotten jealous and invites him back All roads lead to the airport.
