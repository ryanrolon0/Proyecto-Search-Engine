Washerwoman's Mistake

 Mrs. O'Toole is washing clothes when her son arrives home from school and annoys her by firing paper balls at her. She throws some water on him, but he will not desist. The boy finally crawls into a barrel where his "old woman" can't see him and continues to annoy her. She becomes excited and reaching down seizes a bucket of water to throw at him, when the priest suddenly enters and receives the contents of the pail squarely in the face. He falls over the barrel, which collapses, and the boy inside and himself have a warm time together while the old lady is almost scared out of her wits. Very funny and exciting.
