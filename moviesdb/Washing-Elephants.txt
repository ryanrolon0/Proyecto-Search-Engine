Washing Elephants

 A novel and very unusual film, showing a herd of mengarie elephants in their home quarters, enjoying the privilege which they greatly delight in, of a thorough wash down. The huge creatures evidently appreciate what is being done for them, and the scene is one which invariably calls forth rounds of applause.
