Thread

 Threading, a widespread method of facial hair removal in South Asia and the Middle East, has become increasingly popular in the United States. 'Thread' centers on the life of Aida, the vivacious owner of a hip threading salon in the heart of L.A. Aida's threading salon is one of the few that is run by a woman of color born and raised in the United States. When interacting with clients, Aida appears confident and light hearted. As the film progresses, however, it becomes clear that her passion for the world of glamor and beauty stems from a traumatic past. Through exploring Aida's life, 'Thread' illustrates how 'all-American' standards of beauty can trouble the self-images and identities of minority women in the United States.
