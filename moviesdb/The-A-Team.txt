The A-Team

 Four American soldiers who are in Iraq are sent on a mission to recover plates for printing 100 dollar bills that were used to print a billion dollars. After doing the job and returning to the base their commanding officer is killed in an explosion and the plates are stolen by another operative. They would be court martialed and sent to different prisons. 6 months later, the leader, Hannibal Smith is visited by a CIA spook who tells him he knows where the man who took the plates is and wants him and his men to recover it. So he helps him escape and he breaks out the others and they go after the plates. But after doing it, they discover that the spook might not be ok. And a military intelligence officer who was involved with one of them is pursuing them. Meet Hannibal (Liam Neeson), Face (Bradley Cooper), B.A. (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson), and Murdoch (Sharlto Copley). Together, they make the A-Team, a group of skilled army rangers with eighty successive missions under their belt. Stationed out in Iraq, they are approached by CIA agent Lynch (Patrick Wilson) who offers them a job involving stolen USD mint plates and a billion dollars in counterfeit money. The A-Team takes up the job, only to find that it's a setup. Court-martialed and sentenced to four individual prisons - one psychiatric ward, in Murdoch's case - the team is almost a distant memory. Six months later, Hannibal escapes prison and pulls together the team to take down the man who set them up and restore their names. With a demoted captain (Jessica Biel) on their tail - who happens to be Face's old flame - the team races to seize the plates again, only to discover that nothing is as it seems.
