That Summer in LA

 A young, British man, with dreams of a better life, comes to Los Angeles. It is not "Beverly Hills, 90210". During his first few hours in L.A., he is robbed and beaten. Injured, he seeks help from a beautiful, Latin girl who owns a beauty shop. With the urging of her aunt, she reluctantly takes him home to her family in East L. A. There he meets her gang member brother. After an evening in the hood, the Latin girl and another of her brothers, attempt to take our young Brit to a hotel. En route, they spot the young gang member in a parking lot with some of his friends. When the drug deal goes bad, a gun fight breaks out. The gang member brother is shot. The girl needs to get help for her dying brother. The adventure begins... To most people, the past is usually just a fuzzy recollection of times, places, and events that we all go through. How often do you hear someone reflect back on the past, telling their stories as if it were the most vivid memory that they had? The truth be told, most stories are often much more interesting than the people that tell them, or the lives they would have liked you to believe that they had led. The truth is, most people only remember bits and pieces of a life that they think they would have liked to have lived. I know this because, I was one of those people, right up until the day I decided to pack up everything I had and left everyone I knew and set foot on that airplane. I had no idea what my future would hold as vision became reality the moment I stepped off that airplane, That Summer In LA. By the way, my name is Warren, Warren Butler. The Q was a bit of a nightmare but it doesn't matter. I'm in America, the land where dreams come true...
