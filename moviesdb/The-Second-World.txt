The Second World

 The Second World future set on a flooded earth and badly organized space-universe, based upon Italian futurist design in the beginning of the 20th century. Total social decay is just around the corner in this spectacular road movie on water. Laid back - though highly skilled - nautical adventurer James turns judge, juror and executioner after his peace is disturbed by spiritual leader Cook's cannibalistic sect. During his high-speed sailing escape, outnumbered James runs into the love of his life - Shanti. On a small Isle the both are traded by a swindling merchant disguised as a volunteer for the Intergalactic Food program , to Cook's sect for breeding purposes. During one of the sects demonic events the both manage to escape, chased by Cook. In a wild showdown where a battered Cook tries to eat Shanti's baby, James shows himself as a true hero and protector of his family by sending Cook into another world. Powerful. Dynamic. Honest. Brutal. The Second World.
