The First Easter Egg

 A little bunny goes in search of an Easter gift for his mother. A friendly chicken gives him a beautiful egg, but on his way home the bunny encounters several characters that have their own plans for the gift. The egg gets stolen, found, hard cooked and also painted, but eventually the bunny gets the precious gift home to his mother and the story of his mishaps become the birth of a whole new tradition - giving Easter Eggs at Easter.
