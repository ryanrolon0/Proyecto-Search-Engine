Stocking Stuffers

 "Stocking Stuffers" is an experimental comedic short which illuminates through two brief anecdotes how a pair of pantyhose can become an object of desire whose seductive power can either compliment human sexuality - or commodify it. In the first half of the film, the man and the woman engage in sexy banter triggered, in part, by the pantyhose worn by the woman. In the film's second half, the Man and the Woman appear in three interlocking pantyhose commercials. The first half of the film posits in a suggestive way how an object of desire such as pantyhose can compliment human sexuality while the film's second half suggests in a satiric way how the same object of desire can commodify human sexuality.
