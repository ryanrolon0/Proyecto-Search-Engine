Robotprofessoren

 Henrik Hautop Lund is a professor and a robotic scientist at the University of Southern Denmark and he has made Denmark part of the elite in the field of training robots. Adaptability and the perfect interaction between brain and body is the modern ideal for artificial intelligence. However Lund doesn't think human like robots will dominate future homes and industry but he believes the robots will meet each their individual and practical function.
