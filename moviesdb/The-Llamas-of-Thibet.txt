The Llamas of Thibet

 The deep mystery surrounding the Llamas of Thibet makes this subject one of intense interest. Never before have they been photographed except when an occasional explorer at the risk of his life has succeeded in getting a few Kodak views. This picture however shows a sacred procession of the Llamas with their Priests in all the regalia of their rank in the holy city of Jummau. It is very fine photographically and altogether a most unusual and desirable film.
