The Legend of Shizuko Nishimura

 A disgruntled donut shop employee escapes the banal circumstances of her work life by imagining she is the hero in an old-fashioned Western movie. As she wages battle against a bad guy who looks suspiciously like her co-worker, brows sweat... pistol-hands shake... and gunshots ring! But who will end up with the most cream on their face in this DONUT WESTERN.
