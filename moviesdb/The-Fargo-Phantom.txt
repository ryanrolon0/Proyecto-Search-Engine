The Fargo Phantom

 This entry in Universal's series of "Musical Westerns" shorts has Tex Williams, assisted by Deuce Spriggins and Smokey Rogers, bringing his six guns, fists and singing abilities against a gang of stage-robbing bandits. This film was combined with another Tex Williams short, Coyote Canyon, and reissued as the feature-length "Tales of the West No.2.)
