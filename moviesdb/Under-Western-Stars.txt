Under Western Stars

 In his starring debut Roy gets elected to congress in order to bring water to the ranchers in his district. In Washington he learns he needs the backing of a key congressman and gets that man to go west for an inspection trip. When the Congressman is initally unimpressed, Roy gets the inspection party stranded without water to show the true conditions. Roy is elected to Congress to bring the misery of the "dustbowl" of the 1930s to the attention of Washington politicians. Songs include "Dust," "Send My Mail To The County Jail," "Back In The Backwoods," "Rogers For Congressman," and "When A Cowboy Sings A Song."
