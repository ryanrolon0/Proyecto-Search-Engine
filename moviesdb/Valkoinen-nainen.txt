Valkoinen nainen

 Antti (Jouni Takamäki) has a wife, five beautiful children and an idyllic farmhouse. The life and sex are great. But one morning Antti simply leaves and meets the middle-aged woman (Laila Räikkä) and begins a strange journey with her. Is this woman a witch? Antti comes across passion, death and odd people like the murder convict Jukka and impatient taxi-driver Veksi. Some kind of a spell or fate seems to lead these people to their predestined future.
