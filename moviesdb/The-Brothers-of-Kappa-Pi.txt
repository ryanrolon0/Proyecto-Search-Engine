The Brothers of Kappa Pi

 Why do so many recently arrived Filipino youth join gangs?  How have some of these restless youth channeled their angst towards human rights advocacy and community service instead of gang warfare or even worse, murder?  THE BROTHERS OF KAPPA PI is the story of a fraternity based in Queens, New York. Kappa Pi is composed of young Filipinos, mainly immigrants fostering the ideals of their Philippine revolutionary heroes such as Andres Bonifacio. While Kappa Pi is a service-oriented and politically-conscious fraternity, it mimics the structure of a gang to attract new recruits who might otherwise be drawn to the dangerous life of real urban gangs.
