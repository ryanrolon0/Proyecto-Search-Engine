The Convict and the Curate

 An escaped convict breaks into a vicar's home and dons the sleeping vicar's clothes. With nothing else to wear, the vicar has to dress in the convict's clothes, and is mistakenly arrested by the police. The police find the convict hiding in a haystack and bring him to the station to be confronted by the vicar.
