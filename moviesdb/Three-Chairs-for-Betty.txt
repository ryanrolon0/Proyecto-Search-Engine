Three Chairs for Betty

 In this entry of RKO's "Newlyweds" series, Bob and Betty are fighting over the way she spends money, and, in order to put a stop to her buying of antiques, Bob tells her they are broke. Posing as a gangster's moll, Betty convinces an antique dealer that there are valuable antiques at her house, and sells her chairs at auction and makes a huge profit.
