Vidor

 In the world of tomorrow every human activity, life and death as well, are controlled by the Vidor Plan. Every 50 years the sacrifice of a newborn baby allows the survival of the whole humanity. Rex and Era have been chosen as the parents of this baby savior, but as soon as they realize that is impossible to control human emotions, they try to turn against the rules of the Vidor Plan.
