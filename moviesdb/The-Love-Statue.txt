The Love Statue

 Wimpy struggling Greenwich Village painter Tyler Westin is in love with gorgeous, but mean and snippy cabaret dancer Lisa, who treats Tyler like dirt and constantly belittles him. Sultry nightclub singer Mashiko turns Tyler on to LSD. After a nightmarish three day acid trip, Tyler returns to his shabby apartment to find Lisa murdered. Is Tyler responsible for her death? Or did someone else kill Lisa?
