Prøvetid

 Three drug addicts, and a man convicted of attempted murder are released from prison. Through a theater group, they are given an opportunity to show a different side of themselves. They are used to standing alone, but now they are forced to work together in order to complete a shared goal - the opening night. Full of ambition, they begin by making a pact. Not long after, the battle begins with cheating, deceit and self-betrayal. In order to act you have to know who you are; you have to be ruthlessly honest. Opening night steadily approaches and slowly but surely they discover that they all are struggling against the same enemy - themselves. Some fall. Some give up. A few stand tall and fight on.
