Three on the Trail

 An evil gang is involved in both cattle rustling and the robbing of stagecoaches. Hoppy must stop them without help from the sheriff who turns out be a major outlaw himself. Kane is the head of a gang rustling cattle and robbing stages. When Johnny breaks up one of the robberies, Kane sends his stooge Sheriff to arrest him for the robbery. After Hoppy rescues Johnny, Kane gets a wealthy rancher to offer a reward for Hoppy and Johnny dead or alive. Then he tells his men to bring them in dead. The fifth of the Hopalong Cassidy ('William Boyd (I)' (qv)) films and the first to establish Cassidy, Johnny Nelson ('James Ellison' (qv)) and "Windy" Halliday ('George 'Gabby' Hayes' (qv)) as a continuing Bar 20 trio (hence the title), although the Windy character was a film creation and never one of the characters in the Clarence E. Mulford books. This one finds the town of Mesquite in the grip of Pecos Kane ('Onslow Stevens' (qv)), suave, cultured gambler, who, unknown to his fellow citizens, is the leader of the band of rustling and robbing desperadoes. Angered by Johnny's friendship with the new school mar'm, Mary Stevens 'Muriel Evans' (qv)), Kane tries to frame Johnny, along with Cassidy, on the charge of robbing the stagecoach and killing the driver. This fails, but Kane's gang takes Cassidy and Johnny prisoners, and to their desert hideout. The two make an escape and return to Mesquite, where they manage to convince the townspeople of Kane's true nature. Kane, with Mary as his prisoner,and his henchmen barricade the saloon, which is soon afire. Hoppy is wounded, but Johnny, Windy and the others make their way into the saloon, killing Kane and his henchmen and rescuing Mary.
