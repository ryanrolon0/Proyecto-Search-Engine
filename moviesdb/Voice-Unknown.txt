Voice Unknown

 This film reveals the voice of a North Korea refugee woman living in the US. She settled down in an American city after the incredible journey from North Korea. She works at a Korean grocery store now. She shares her psychological condition of living, a communist culture to American culture, and homeland to the new land. Her painful memories of loss resonate with historical memories by historical footage juxtaposing with her personal space in the new land. The sound track and the visual track is created independently as the director's decision of representing a woman who cannot show her face. This film leads the audience to have the experience of exile. It is about dislocation, loss and the creation of a new life.
