The Couch

 Perfect cat, perfect friends, perfect job and then one day you wake up and it's all gone and the cat has peed on your couch. Joy throws her couch out into the alley behind her apartment and it creates a hub of activity. She becomes addicted to living vicariously through those who are drawn to the couch. Will she learn from them?
