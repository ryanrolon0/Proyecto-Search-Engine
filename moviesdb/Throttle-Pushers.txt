Throttle Pushers

 An MGM short with occasionally humorous commentary by 'Pete Smith (I)' (qv) who this time out tells the viewer all about the auto racing industry. Some of the cars have 200 horsepower and can hit hit 100 miles per hour. It features many of the racing stars of the day and then the race itself. Several of the cars crash with a couple of them looking quite severe.
