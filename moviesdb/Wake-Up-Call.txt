Wake-Up Call

 Roy Stone has recently become homeless and decides to make a documentary film about his homeless experience on the streets of Seattle. While shooting his film, he meets a young woman, Iris, a shy, aspiring musician who has become homeless herself and they form an unlikely alliance to survive on the streets together. When Roy finally hears Iris' musical talent, he convinces her to perform on the streets to raise the money for her plane ticket back home to Kansas. Iris' struggle to overcome her fear of performing becomes the focus of his film. When Roy falls in love with Iris, he must face the fact that helping her off the streets will ultimately lead to their separation.
