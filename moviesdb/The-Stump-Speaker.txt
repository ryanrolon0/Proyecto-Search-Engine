The Stump Speaker

 Fellow Democrats, oh, I mean fellow Republicans, or else I mean, to the users of films, see this great picture. Our orator advances to the center of the stage a meek, lowly little individual, but as he warms up to his subject he also swells up himself until at last he becomes so large and so full of hot air, which he cannot exhaust, that he is as helpless as a baby; he grows from 30 breast measure to about 60 inches breast measure.
