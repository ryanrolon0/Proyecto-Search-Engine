The Making of 'Rinne'

 This "making of" documentary follows the "Rinne" ("Reincarnation" is the USA DVD title) cast and crew from April 29 until June 26, 2005, as they rehearse, build sets, create special effects, and celebrate personal milestones such as birthdays at filming sites across Japan. The general politeness involved in the production process for this eerie horror-movie-within-a-movie contrasts sharply with reports from the sets of many big budget features filmed in other countries. Two of the lead actresses display tricks they can do with their double-jointed fingers.
