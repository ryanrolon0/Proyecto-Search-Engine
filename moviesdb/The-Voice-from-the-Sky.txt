The Voice from the Sky

 A crazed scientist calling himself The Voice from the Sky broadcasts his voice all across the globe, and threatens to suspend all energy in the earth's atmosphere and turn day into night unless the world immediately destroys all arms and vehicles of warfare. U. S. Secret Service agent Jack Deering is sent to Arizona to investigate, where he meets the scientist's daughter Jean. The ten-episode battle then ensues between Deering, a spy for the Russian government, an agent from Scotland Yard, and a mysterious cloaked "Man from Nowhere," who pursue each other from Canada to California in the attempt to acquire the "secret of the air."
