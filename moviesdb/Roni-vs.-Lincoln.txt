Roni vs. Lincoln

 Two bird-brained mob goofs are assigned to 'whack' the zombie of Abraham Lincoln. What they failed to realize is that zombies are really freaking' scary. Can they muster up enough piecemeal historical knowledge to send the Great Emancipator back to hell? To find out watch this gut-busting gut-buster of a movie! You'll laugh yourself all the way back to 1776 (or whenever the heck Lincoln was alive).
