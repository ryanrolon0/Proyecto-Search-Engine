The Devil's Courthouse

 Four friends Amber, Kelly, Preston, and Brian go out into the woods on a quest for spiritual enlightment to The Devil's Courthouse, which has long been rumored a mystical place. Native American Legend has it that deep in the woods there is a cave with a shaft leading straight to hell. They are warned by a Park Ranger but still Amber( Julian Kelly) encourages the group to go on. After groping through the abrasive wilderness of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and fighting against both natural and supernatural to stay alive, things look hopeless for the group. The friends find themselves risking their lives, while they are lost and deperately alone looking for something that might best be left alone... hidden... in the Devil's Courthouse.
