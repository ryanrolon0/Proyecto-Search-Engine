Tomatos Another Day

 The images on the screen tell it all. In a drawing room, the clock shows two on an afternoon. Adulterous lovers cling; her husband is due home momentarily, so he leaves. She goes to a table to play solitaire, sitting on her departed lover's hat. She removes it and sets it on the table as her husband enters. She denies anyone has been with her, except her lover. She and her husband go into the bedroom. The lover comes back for his hat. The married couple returns to the drawing room, and the men confront each other, with cigarettes, pistol, and puns, while she sits at the table. Is there anything anyone can do for the other in this satire on the needlessness of talking pictures?
