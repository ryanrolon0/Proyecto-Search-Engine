Things We Did Last Summer

 One week, instead of the beloved, in-studio zaniness of SNL, viewers were treated to this bizarre collection of short docu/mocu-mentary films. Lorraine Newman details her surreal adventures on a tropical vacation. Bill Murray semi-seriously quits comedy for the chance to play minor-league baseball. At the end of summer he again "retires" a la Lou Gehrig. Gilda Radner picks up some extra cash by offering guided tours of her New York City apartment. Jake and Elwood Blues (John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd) rip up the stage on a genuine concert tour. Garrett Morris' vignette has, sadly, faded from memory. The Garrett Morris vignette was deceptive in its genius. Mr. Morris got up one morning, dressed in jockey silks and traveled through the streets of New York. At first it appeared as though he had taken a job as a jockey. However, in a denouement that could only be pulled off in 1977 and only by an African American comedian, Mr. Morris ended in a studio posing for a lawn jockey sculpture.
