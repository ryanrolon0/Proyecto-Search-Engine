Wake Up, Ron Burgundy

 This "alternate film" companion to _Anchorman (2004)_(qv) was compiled from dropped sub-plots and alternate takes. While Ron Burgundy's rivalry with Veronica Corningstone continues, a group of unprofessional thieves better known as 'The Alarm Clock' try to make the truth known, whatever that may be.
