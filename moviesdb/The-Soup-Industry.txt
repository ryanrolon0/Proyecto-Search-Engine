The Soup Industry

 Number two in the amusing Near Educational Series. Visitors to the soup factory are conducted through the plant, where they see the raw materials prepared by pretty girls and conveyed to the macerators, whence the chopped ingredients go to the big cauldrons for boiling. The visitors' eagerness to see every detail of the process gets them into many amusing scrapes, and finally they land literally 'in the soup.'
