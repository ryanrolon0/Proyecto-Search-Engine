Recon 7 Down

 In 1943, with the Allied powers in a stalemate against the German forces in Italy, and the Red Army not gaining ground on the Eastern front, British Intelligence, along with the U.S. O.S.S devise a secret mission to lure German troops away from the Eastern front. This helps the Red Army gain ground against Germany. British Intelligence acquire three experimental Russian "Yaks" that are to be flown by American pilots from the 7th Army Air Corps. The covert mission is to fly across the English Channel to do reconnaissance and to strafe German troops. This entices Rommell to contact Hitler requesting reinforcements from the Russian front, believing the Red Army and British and American forces are about to invade the beaches of Calais. During this operation, pilot Tom Meyers, and his spotter, Bob Sanders, are shot down behind enemy lines.
