Vegetable Vaudeville

 The vegetables and fruits stage a vaudeville show that headlines such acts as The Cabbage Brothers, Miss Rosie Apple, and the Nacy Beans who do a hornpipe dance. The really-Big Show opens with Carrot Crooner crooning "Let's Get Lost," while a couple of Peaches swoon. Comedian Corn Cob's act is so corny that he is razzed by the Berries, sitting in a prominent box. Carmen Banana has the top-spot and, aided by the bouncing ball, asks everyone to join her in singing "Yes, We Have No Bananas."
