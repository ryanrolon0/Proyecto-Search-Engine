This Way Please

 A famous singer and matinEe idol helps a pretty young theater usher in her dreams of becoming a singer, but when her career begins to take off and she becomes engaged to a wealthy young man, he realizes he's fallen for her and plots to break up her impending marriage. Dancer Jane Morrow gets a job as an usherette in a movie theatre and meets Brad Morgan, popular master-of-ceremonies and band-leader. They begin a romance. Believing that Brad is showing too much interest in Jane, eccentric theatre-manager S. J. Crawford fires him. Maxine Barry, Crawford's niece, talks her uncle into giving Jane an audition, she makes good and Crawford bills her as the girl-who-broke-Brad Morgan's-heart. Press-agent "Inky" Wells decides an on-stage wedding at the theatre, between Jane and Brad, would be big-time box-office,and gets Brad to agree to it. But Brad, enraged about Jane's billing, has other plans; he intends to not show up, and leave standing alone at the theatre-altar.
