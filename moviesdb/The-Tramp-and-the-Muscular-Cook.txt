The Tramp and the Muscular Cook

 "The tramp comes into a kitchen and begs for a piece of freshly made cake which he sees near the window. He is refused; but attempts to steal it. As he does so, he is caught in the act by the cook, who belabors him over the head with a rolling-pin, much to the tramp's discomfort."
