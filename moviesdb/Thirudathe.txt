 MGR plays a street-smart thief, who falls in love with a woman he rescues from crooks. On one occasion, he steals a bundle of cash that leads the loser to his own death. This causes MGR to try and reform, but it may be too late - the man whose death he is responsible for turns out to be closely related to him.
