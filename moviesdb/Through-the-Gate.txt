Through the Gate

 A teenage girl reads fantasy novels to escape boredom and loneliness in her big empty house. As the words of classics like A Wrinkle in Time and Alice in Wonderland blur together, so do reality and the girl's imagination. When an unexpected visitor arrives, the two girls become unlikely friends, and a special bond forms.
