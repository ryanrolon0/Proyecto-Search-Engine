The Love Feast

 Mr. Murphy, a photographer, lures models to his house on the pretense of legitimate modelling work, and then busies himself bedding them. After a while, his bedroom has gotten pretty crowded and he's exhausted, so he snags a taxi cab driver to help out. Soon, a trio of domineering women show up and force him (willingly) to dress in women's clothes and submit to their whims.
