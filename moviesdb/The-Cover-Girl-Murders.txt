The Cover Girl Murders

 With his magazine, "Image", in financial trouble, Rex needs one spectacular issue to pull it out so he flies his editor, Kate, and a group of his top models to an isolated island paradise for a photo shoot. From the beginning, the trip is marred by Rex's designs on Kate's younger sister, Rachel, and his ruthless manipulation of the models and crew. Finally, he pushes one of the women into a stunt that costs her her life, beginning a pattern of death and murder reminiscent of "Ten Little Indians".
