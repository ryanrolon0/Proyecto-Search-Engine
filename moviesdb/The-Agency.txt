The Agency

 Tommy Cho, a twenty-something slacker who still lives with his parents, gets a job at an elite, cutting-edge company offering a facial-scanning technology that reports the exact number of times any woman has ever been pictured during masturbation. As Tommy explores this mysterious tech, he comes closer than ever to connecting with his childhood crush. But his new-found ambition also unwittingly reverses his chronic failure with the ladies, unleashing a woman from his past who would like to prove to him that his wildest fantasies can come true.
