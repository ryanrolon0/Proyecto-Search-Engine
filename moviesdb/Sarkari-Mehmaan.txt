Sarkari Mehmaan

 Police Sub-Inspector Anand is known for his honesty, diligence and bravery. He single-handedly captures and arrests notorious smuggler and gangster Jack, has him sentenced to several years in prison. Then using plainclothes and a disguise as a Nawab, he entraps another notorious hoodlum named Gul Khan, and also has him arrested and sentenced to a long prison term. Although things go well with Anand at his work-place, things are not all that hunky-dory at home, as his wife, Rekha, who comes from a wealthy family, is unhappy about her new lower status in society and in the community, resulting in frequent arguments, with Anand threatening to kill her on several occasions. Then Anand comes to know about her having an affair Somesh and starts to follow her, hoping to catch them red-handed. Shortly after that Rekha and Somesh are found dead, and Anand is arrested for their murders. He is tried in court and sentenced to prison for life. Anand knows that he has not killed them, but in order to prove his innocence, he decides to escape from prison and catch the real killer(s). Before he could even plan his escape - he comes face to face with his foes - namely Jack and the seemingly invincible Gul Khan - who will kill him in a heartbeat.
