The Eccentric Entertainer

 The setting is a well-appointed drawing room. Sol Violinsky sits at a Baldwin piano playing. The first number is fast-paced, allowing Violinsky to shine. Then he plays a piece in the manner of musical accompaniment to a silent movie - with extra sound effects and sudden changes in mood. "The March of the Wooden Soldiers" follows that, and he concludes with a tour de force, playing piano with one hand and fretting a violin with the other. He's attached the bow to his right leg enabling him to play the instruments simultaneously.
