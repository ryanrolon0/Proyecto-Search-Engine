The Samurai Returns

 In sixteenth-century Japan, samurai are called away to fight. As he's leaving, Juro gives his wife Hitomi a small red bag with a ring in it, his promise to return. There are yakuza in the area, so Juro tells Takumi, his son or younger brother, to watch over Hitomi and keep her safe. Takumi promises. Juro leaves for war, and the yakuza come. Can promises hold?
