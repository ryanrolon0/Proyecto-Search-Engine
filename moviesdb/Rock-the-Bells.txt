Rock the Bells

 Rock the Bells is a documentary on the preparation and realization of the original Wu-Tang Clan's final live performance. The film focuses on hip-hop concert promoter Chang Weisberg, whose Guerrilla Union production company showcases live hip-hop of a noncommercial bent. Weisberg comes across as a mixture of fanboy and snake-oil salesman, but it is his attention to detail that allows him to undertake what no other promoter had managed to accomplish in a long time of the Wu-Tang Clan in live performance. Using a small, cohesive team of immensely likable, pleasant people, Weisberg navigates all the pitfalls of his endeavor with composure, even when the concert is in full-throttle. Hours before the concert is supposed to begin, the Guerrilla Union crew is forced to contend with an incompetent security team, an overanxious crowd on the verge of rioting, and the singular mania of the now deceased Ol' Dirty Bastard, in what amounts to a partial tribute film. But the pay off for all the late nights and hustle is a platinum performance, and the audience, in turn, is left with the feeling that they've played a crucial part in making this unique occurrence possible.
