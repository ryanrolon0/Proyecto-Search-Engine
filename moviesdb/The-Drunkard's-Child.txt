The Drunkard's Child

 As a young boy with crutches is selling newspapers, one of his customers drops some money. The child's father, standing nearby, reaches to take the money for himself, but the child hurriedly alerts the customer and returns it. The grateful customer treats the boy to some food and some new clothes, and then takes him home. When the child's mother dies soon afterwards, she entrusts the boy to the kindly man. But the boy's drunken father is not willing to let his son go in peace.
