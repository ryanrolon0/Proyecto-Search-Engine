Prostitution heute

 So-called documentary on the work of prostitutes. In Germany lots of these fake-documentaries were made, mainly in the '70's. The soft-core scenes were disguised as documentaries, just to avoid the censors. Most of these movies were called 'reports', Schulmaedchen Reporte, at least 14 parts (Schoolgirl Reports) and Hausfrauen Reporte (House Wife Reports).
