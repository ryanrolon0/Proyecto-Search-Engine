Taxi Ballad

 A disenchanted taxi driver from the country moves to the big city hoping to become the greatest taxi driver in the country. While caroming the after hours streets of Beirut, he forms an unlikely bond with a bored American Pilates instructor, and shares with her stories from a better time and place, the romantic village of his childhood.
