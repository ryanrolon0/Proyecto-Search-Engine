Ringenes herskerinde

 In her Copenhagen studio, master piercer Mette Hintze talks to the camera, explaining her attention to hygiene, method, and ethics. She walks us through the geography of piercing from eyebrows to genitals; she gives brief histories of various piercings; and, she describes the two main reasons people are pierced of her clients are interviewed, and we meet Spritt Schapiro, her apprentice. Hintze connects her work to the movement of modern primitives, for whom piercings and tattoos are art. Last of all, we meet one of her heroes, whom she calls Holed Hans, and she puts her little finger through his septum. She's delighted.
