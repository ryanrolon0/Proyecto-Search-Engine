Prince Henry at Cramp's Shipyard

 Two distinct pictures of the Prince when on a visit to Cramp's shipyard, Philadelphia. These pictures were taken at different times in different parts of the great ship builder's plant and show the Prince to an advantage. We had the only permit issued by the authorities in this city on the day the Prince paid his visit here.
