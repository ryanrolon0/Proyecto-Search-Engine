Preventing Genocide

 Preventing Genocide focuses on not just remembering the victims of genocide, but practical steps and effective action toward preventing future genocides. It examines genocides of the 20th century including Armenia, the Nazi Holocaust, and Rwanda and what can be learned from them. It also examines instances where genocide was prevented, including South Africa and Kenya. The documentary is aimed toward a new generation of students and others who can help prevent genocide in the 21st century.
