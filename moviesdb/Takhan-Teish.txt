Takhan Teish

 Tamodeep is brilliant, sensitive and eternally perturbed by his grandfather's prophecy that he would either be an artist or run away from home. A junior doctor by profession, Tamodeep has little communication with his near and dear ones, even lesser with his mother Sraboni, against whom he nurses a grudge for intruding into his life during his adolescent years. Quiet and introvert on the surface, Tamodeep is quite restless within. His desires often take complex routes and hover around Meghna, his former biology teacher and now a psychological counselor on radio, Mohini, the sex siren of soft porn movies and Sriparna, a law student whom he befriends on a cyber social networking site. The night before his 23rd birthday, Mohini, gets admitted in his nursing home as a accident victim and Tamodeep's life is destined to change forever.. In his desperate attempt to prevent Mohini from going out of his life, Tamodeep has to go through a series of overlapping events involving the four women in his life - his mother Sraboni, his former teacher Meghna, his Facebook buddy Sriparna and his ultimate fantasy Mohini, who steer him through an unique journey of enlightenment and self-realisation.
