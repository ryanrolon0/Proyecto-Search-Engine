Thanks, Mom

 Daniel Wright, son of prominent murder mystery novelist Elizabeth Wright, is driven to follow in his mother's footsteps. When Danny finds himself blocked in trying to complete his first novel in time for a competition deadline, his mother enters as his "dear Watson." Their all-nighter proves to be about more than writing the perfect crime. Elizabeth helps Danny come to terms with his relationship with his father and his emotional struggles about his future.
