Venice Beach in the Sixties

 From 1960 to 1964, I lived in Venice Beach, California, then known as Venice, Slum by the Sea. It was also the heart of the mushrooming beat and hippie cultures. Its free-spirited, flamboyant inhabitants fascinated me, and I filmed all who attracted my lens. Today, 43 years later, I have edited this footage into a 15-minute documentary titled Venice Beach in the Sixties-A Celebration of Creativity. It includes a hippie Halloween costume party; a hip non-costume party, with erotic dancers dressed only in body-paint; and an encounter with LSD, a life-enhancing experience that influenced my films by unveiling to me the mystical universe in its eternal aspect.
