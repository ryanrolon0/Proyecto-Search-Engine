The Peace! DVD

 There are years when nothing happens and then days that change the course of History. From September 2002 to May 2003 we met with intellectuals, journalists, university professors, writers, historians, political analysts, international observers, human rights organizations, civil rights fighters, religious leaders, peace and anti war activists, asking questions to understand these years in which we are living and try to put together the many pieces of a complicated puzzle. The picture that comes alive is - to paraphrase James Baldwin - "longer, larger, more various, more beautiful, and more terrible than anything anyone has ever said about it". 2000 Presidential Elections and September 11, 2001. Afghanistan, Iraq, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein and the inspections. The axis of evil, the coalition of the willing and collateral damages. News, media, concentrations of power and censorship. The Middle East and the old and new colonialism. Civil liberties and human rights. United Nations, International Criminal Court and the Old Europe. War, peace and patriotism. The anti war movement, oil, blood and the voices of dissent. Is it possible to find interconnecting links?
