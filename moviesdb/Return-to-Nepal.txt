Return to Nepal

 Producer/director Robert Lang and cinematographer Guy Clarkson accompany musician Bruce Cockburn as he returns to the spectacular Himalayan kingdom after twenty years away. He finds a land where much has changed, with a Maoist government recently installed, women newly empowered and fresh initiatives to deal with the grinding poverty of the majority of the Nepali people. But it's also a land where, in some of the remotest areas, life is lived much in the way it has for centuries -- salt caravans, subsistence farming on steep mountain terraces and off-the-grid villages connected by an ancient network of footpaths. Return to Nepal is a revealing glimpse at a corner of the world we know little about, but whose people have much to offer us shining examples of interdependence and determination.
