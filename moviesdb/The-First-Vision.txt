The First Vision

 In Palmyra, New York in 1820, 14 year-old Joseph Smith wonders about what church is true. He feels that none of the other faiths are not true and wants an answer. One spring morning, he goes out to pray in a grove near his home and starts to pray. He feels an evil spirit trying to prevent him from praying. Then, he sees the most beautiful light and sees 2 personages. They are Heavenly Father and his son Jesus Christ. They told Joseph that he should not join any of the churches because they were of the wrong faith. They also told Joseph to restore the true church of Jesus Christ.
