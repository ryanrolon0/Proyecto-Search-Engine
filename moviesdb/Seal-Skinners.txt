Seal Skinners

 A trained seal has escaped from the Jingling Brothers circus; there's a $100,000 reward. Both the Captain and John Silver hear this news, as does the seal. They show up, offering the seal a ride to wherever she wants to go; home to the arctic, as it happens. The Captain wins round one, grabbing the seal while John is engaged in a fight with yet another reward seeker. But John's got a few tricks up his sleeve, primarily the seal suit he dresses up in that fools the seal briefly and the Captain for a bit longer.
