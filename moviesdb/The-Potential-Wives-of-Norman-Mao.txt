The Potential Wives of Norman Mao

 Norman Mao is an overweight, and socially-awkward junior businessman from Hong Kong, who at the age of 33 is still a virgin and unwed. Desperate to get him married, his parents take him on an international junket across the globe to find him a worthy Chinese wife. The Maos arrive to a New York City hotel, which is their final stop on their trip and their last hope to find Norman a bride. Having hired a professional matchmaking service, the Maos meet with three matches for Norman. Will one of these women be a potential wife for Norman or is he destined to lead a terribly lonely life?
