The Found

 Sam, a lost soul, wanders aimlessly through the waterfront streets of Brooklyn when he happens upon three men who attempt to rob him. Realizing he hasn't anything of value, they take out their frustrations on him until a stranger appears from the darkness and rescues him. The stranger carries Sam to a late night bar where they sit for a cup of coffee. In the ensuing conversation the men get to know each other and we learn of the life-changing incident that that has caused them to cross paths on this night.
