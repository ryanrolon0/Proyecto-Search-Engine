Secret of Outlaw Flats

 Marshals Wild Bill Hickok ('Guy Madison' (qv)) and his deputy sidekick, Jingles ('Andy Devine (I)' (qv)) are investigating a series of mine-shipment robberies from a stage line serving a silver mine managed by Canfield ('Wade Crosby' (qv)). Helped by stage driver Sandy Smith ('Bobby Jordan (I)' (qv)) and Peggy ('Jane Adams (I)' (qv)), Wild Bill and Jingles prove that Canfield himself engineered the robberies and the crimes cease. Business taken care of in that vicinity, Wild Bill and Jingles ride on to a new case in Outlaw Flats, where a wealthy rancher has been killed and robbed. They question Cindy (Kristine Miller' (qv)), the rancher's granddaughter, and Dick ('Richard Avonde' (qv)), her fiancEe, about the case. Then, after some more investigating that leads to a fighting chase, Wild Bill and Jingles unmask the real killer and thief.
