A desperate mother places her son in a basket and lets the Hebrew god guide it along its way on the river. The basket is found by the Queen, and Moses is brought up as a brother to the heir of the throne, Ramses. Years later, the brothers, who grew up happily and wealthy, are split by Moses' recognition of his true heritage and the suppressing system his brother is about to inherit, willing to carry it on. Fleeing from the city in despair, Moses finds himself being called by God. He is given the task of being the messenger in order to free the Hebrews and to lead them into a country where milk and honey flow. In ancient Egypt, Moses, the prince of Egypt, finds he is a Hebrew and that he was born a slave. After leaving Egypt and meeting Jethro. the high priest, and marrying Jethro's daughter, Tzporah, Moses must return to Egypt to free his people with the hands of God to lead him.
