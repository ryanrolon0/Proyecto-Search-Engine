The Games I Made Up

 A short animation about my childhood tendency to create imaginative games by using the world around me. Within these games I imagined everyday objects to be something more than they are, such as pretending the repeating pattern on wallpaper was an endless maze. Within the film I portray a series of these memories connected by visual transitions which mimic the daydream-like fashion by which I recall memories.
