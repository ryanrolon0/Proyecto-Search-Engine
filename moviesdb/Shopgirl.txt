Shopgirl

 The story follows Mirabelle, a disenchanted salesgirl and aspiring artist who sells gloves and accessories at a department store. She has two men in her life Mirabelle falls in love with the glamorous Ray, and her life takes a magical turn, but eventually she realizes that she must empower herself and make a choice between them. In her 20s, Mirabelle leaves taciturn parents in Vermont to live in L.A. She sells gloves at Saks, lives alone in a flat, and sporadically pursues her art (photography and pencil). She's so lonely she'll sleep with Jeremy, a clueless, penniless graphic artist and constant talker she meets at a laundromat. About the time Jeremy sets off on a months-long road trip as a rock band's groupie, Mirabelle meets Ray Porter, pushing 60, wealthy, charming, living in L.A. and Seattle. He thinks he's made it clear it's just an affair; she hears it's more. She's on cloud nine. Meanwhile, on the road trip, Jeremy listens to self-help tapes on relating to women. Can a shopgirl find true romance?
