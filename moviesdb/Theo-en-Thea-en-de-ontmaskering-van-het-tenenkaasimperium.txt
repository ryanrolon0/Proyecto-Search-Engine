Theo en Thea en de ontmaskering van het tenenkaasimperium

 Theo and Thea want to make a movie of Snow White, but Gerard Joling, who should play prince, cries off. Someone suggests to ask opera singer Marco Bakker. First he doesn't want to, but when Theo and Thea dress up like jazz singers Bea and Ans, he decides to join in. Marco even falls in love with the dressed-up Theo.
