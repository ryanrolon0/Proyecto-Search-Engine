The Hobo's Roundup

 In this picture we find a party of hobos wending their way along a railroad track, when they come upon one of their kind building a fire, but with nothing to eat, and the newly arrived trio immediately start on a foraging expedition to a nearby village. Mrs. Brown's cook has just placed some pastry in the kitchen window to cool, when the trio, going to the front door, ask for food. They are refused, and the door impetuously slammed in their faces. Going around to the side street the pastry is discovered in the window. This is purloined without delay, and soon they are enjoying their feast in the camp by the tracks. In the meantime the cook has told of the theft, and with the approach of a posse of cowpunchers, the feast is disturbed, and the hobos make their getaway, with the cowpunchers in hot pursuit. A wild chase ensues, the hobos eventually escaping just as the cowpunchers dash up, by swinging onto the rear of a freight train leaving town. The usual narrow getaway made by the 'knight of the ties.
