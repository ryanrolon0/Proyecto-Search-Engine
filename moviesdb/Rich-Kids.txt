Rich Kids

 A story about a group of rich kids, from old money families, north of Copenhagen, from a world where people with ambition and power rule. The kids are often left alone, feeling rejected and spending most of their time living on the edge, transcending boundaries, seeking attention, often trying to get revenge against people who don't listen to them. Away from the superficiality and pretention of their social class, they live a secret life, in which power, money, sex, drugs and endless secrets dominate. A lifestyle only a few of them can survive and where most become scarred for life. Writer, director Rune Bendixen spent 6 months with the group of rich kids, interviewing them. His script for "Rich Kids" is based on these interviews. The movie is about a group of young, beautiful and most of all rich kids, who try to drown their parents neglect in booze, drugs and sex. They all live in the richest neighborhoods in Denmark with designer clothes, yachts and cars. They might look cool from the outside, but in their environment everything is about power, money and respect, and none of them can handle the pressure of constantly proving themselves to the group.
