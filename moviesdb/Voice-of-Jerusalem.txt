Voice of Jerusalem

 What happened to "Jerusalem of Gold"? Is there any hope or solution to the problems surrounding Jerusalem? Which of the three religions should have the right to control Jerusalem? Should Jerusalem be the capital city? Maybe all that is happening in Jerusalem stems from the "Jerusalem Syndrome" that causes one to lose touch with reality and ones stability. Did Israel and Jerusalem's leaders suffer from this syndrome as well? This movie tries to answer many of these questions talking to a number of people from various walks of life in this unique city and through the many songs sung longingly about this city, over time.
