Si le soleil ne revenait pas

 In a mountainside village, where the sun never shines in winter, the old prophet Anzevui announces that, in this year 1937, war will break out and the sun will never shine again. The village is divided into two camps those who resign themselves to the news, such as Arlettaz who drowns his sorrow in alcohol, and those who keep the torch of hope alight, such as Cyprien who sets out to find the sun. He returns exhausted but a young girl, Isabelle, takes up his struggle, followed by other villagers who have not lost hope. They will greet the rising sun which the dying Anzevui will never see.
