Wasted Life

 Our hero is an optimistic young man named Roy, who decides he'd like to try a meaningful pursuit for once - he'll be a teacher! He's quickly rejected by the local Teaching Annex, on the grounds he knows nothing worth teaching. To combat this dismissal, Roy launches into an exuberant musical number, spanning over twenty NYC locations. Through song, Roy makes clear exactly what he's learned in his twenty-five years on the planet, and determines whether his life has in fact amounted to anything.
