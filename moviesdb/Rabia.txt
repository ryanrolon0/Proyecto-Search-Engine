Rabia

 Exploring the image of the Mexican/Chicano masked wrestler or Luchador to serve as a visual metaphor for an intersection of individuality with the images and sounds of popular and historic mass media. The content of this work reflects a transformation and occurrence that is expressed through the global civil right experience where the collective sounds of struggles for social justice and liberty are reflected through the voices of resistance that are juxtaposed with the image of the Luchador. He is a free fighter that undergoes a symbolic metamorphosis into an ethereal being that encompasses the notion of inner transformation through struggle that liberates the individual to be a specter of deliverance from oppression and a luminous presence for hope.
