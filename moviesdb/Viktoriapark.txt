Viktoriapark

 Early morning in the Viktoriapark. A man in a suit awakes. He finds an old gun. Deeper and deeper he gets into an emotional maelstrom from which he can free himself apparently only with violence. Finally, he discovers his ex-wife and her new lover, here in the Viktoriapark. The place where everybody get together.
