The Things We Used to Do on Grass

 The opening of a new indoor sports facility in the run-down former mining town of Stellarton, Nova Scotia, breathes new life into the locals who find all sorts of uses for the artificial grass surface. Images of the activities supported by superb narration by some of the areas older inhabitants, telling us the things THEY used to do on grass... Includes a superb soundtrack by international acts Grand Drive and XTC. Real people. Fake Grass.
