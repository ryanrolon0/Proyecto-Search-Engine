Twist Around the Clock

 The plot is virtually identical to the plot of the earlier film "Rock Around the Clock." A struggling manager visits a hayseed town and discovers a new dance craze, and hopes to turn it into a overnight nationwide sensation. Features performances by Chubby Checker and Dion.
