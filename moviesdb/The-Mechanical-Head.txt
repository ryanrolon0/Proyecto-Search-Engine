The Mechanical Head

 It is to laugh. Just see this picture and split your sides with laughter. A large head of enormous proportions faces the audience, and makes grimaces that would make a horse laugh. His huge tongue protrudes from his mouth and licks up everything in sight, including a bottle and several other equally hard substances. Excruciatingly funny. This act is performed by the celebrated Walter Stanton.
