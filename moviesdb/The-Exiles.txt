The Exiles

 When Germany gets a new Chancellor, a high-ranking Russian-Jewish diplomat puts his career - and his life - on the line to convince complacent and greedy political leaders of Hitler's murderous intentions before it is too late. REDS meets MISSION IMPOSSIBLE when a startling bit of "lost" history is revealed to us through the memories of Ivy Low, the feisty, outspoken widow of Maxim Litvinov, Bolshevik revolutionary, Russian diplomat, and the only Jew in Stalin's inner circle. The story focuses specifically on Maxim Litvinov's race against the clock to stop Hitler, as Litvinov alone among the world's leadership fully grasps the magnitude of what is about to happen.
