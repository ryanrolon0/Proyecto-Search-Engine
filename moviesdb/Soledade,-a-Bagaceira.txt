Soledade, a Bagaceira

 Sugarcane mill is modernized by the owner's son, opposing his father's wishes. He is sent to study in a big city and, when Governor João Pessoa dies, he comes back to his hometown and his loved one, Soledade, trying to start a revolution in the sugarcane fields. But his father also loves Soledade, and they have to compete for her love.
