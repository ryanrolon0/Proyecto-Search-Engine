Six Foot Six

 On a London street, three telephone conversations are held in three adjacent telephone boxes. A groom who is the butt of a revenge joke, a jilted girlfriend who is out for revenge, and an estranged father who is the victim of the worst kind of revenge. All conversations depict the theme of revenge and the various forms it takes.
