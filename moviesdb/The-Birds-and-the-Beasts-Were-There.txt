The Birds and the Beasts Were There

 This short subject visits three animal parks in Miami, Florida, all of which still operate today. At the time of filming, these attractions were considered to be in the outskirts of the city. The first stop is the Rare Bird Farm, where many rare chickens, cranes, and other birds are on display. Then it's off to the Monkey Jungle, where the visitors are caged and the simian inhabitants roam in freedom. The last stop is the Parrot Jungle.
