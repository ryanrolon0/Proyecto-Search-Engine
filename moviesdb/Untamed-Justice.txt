Untamed Justice

 Louise Hill has the combination to the safe and is the bookkeeper for George Morrow at his investment firm. She goes to lunch, is hit upon by Herbert Winslow , gives him a brush-off and goes back to work. But she drops her purse containing the combination to the safe. That night, Winslow and his henchman Jim show up to rob the safe, but Louise is working late on the books. She discovers them, but Jim tells her that Morrow is one hard customer and when he finds his safe has been emptied, he will most likely have her jailed for theft, since she and Morrow are the only ones who know the safe combination. They leave with the loot, and Louise thinks maybe she might be better off gone herself, since she has no way to prove she wasn't involved. She calls her brother and heads for his mountain retreat and, via a telegram left on his desk, learns that he has gone to Chicago to sign a contract with his publisher. But his faithful dog Muro is there to greet her. But the big-city detectives have traced Louise as far as Pine Points, Nevada, where they lose her trail. To relieve her monotony Louise makes a long-distance acquaintanceship with Norman Bard , an airmail pilot whose ship flies over the house each day. Bard drops Lousie copies of the Nevada News each day. Meanwhile, Winslow and Jim have also trekked westward and have just robbed the bank in the town where Louise goes grocery shopping. They make an escape and end up at Louise's hideout. She gets away long enough to climb up on the roof and write the message "Help." Bard sees the message and lands his plane and heads for the house.
