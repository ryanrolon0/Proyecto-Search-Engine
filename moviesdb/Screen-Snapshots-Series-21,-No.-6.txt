Screen Snapshots Series 21, No. 6

 Alan Mowbray, then starring in a series of comedy shorts for Columbia, acts as Master of Ceremonies and tour guide on a trip to stores, shops and sports events in Hollywood. The first stop is at Slapsie Maxies where stars are watching the floor show, and then to a donut shop where several stars are seen dunking donuts. The short ends up at a charity baseball game between comedians and leading men.
