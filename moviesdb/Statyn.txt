Statyn

 A day in the middle of August. Something had disappeared. If you cant trust what you know you have seen, can you trust anything? And if that's the case, what does it then matter what others think? But it's the feeling of not being believed. The feeling of being right hasn't anything to do with knowing. Per Ottosson questions whose truth you shall follow with the sense of the absurd as a tool.
