The Trey o' Hearts

 Judith Trine, along with her embittered, crippled father, Seneca Trine, are out for revenge against Alan Law, whose dead father was blamed for the affliction of Pa Trane. Judith has an identical twin sister named Rose, much more lovable than the revenge-seeking Judith, and Rose is in love with Alan. By the time chapter 15 comes along, Judith has also fallen in love with Alan, but, alas too late. But she shows up at the wedding of Alan and Rose, and gets a big break. Lightning strikes the chapel and good-sister Rose is killed and the bride groom stricken unconscious. When he comes to Alan thinks he is being nursed and comforted by his wife Rose and Judith doesn't bother telling him otherwise. A crippled old man and his daughter plot to kill a young man they mistakenly believe was responsible for the man's injury. Matters get complicated when his other daughter, who is a twin, falls in love with the intended victim. While at his club, Alan Law one day receives a red rose and a playing card. The twin messages will start Law on a strange quest that will take him halfway around the world while various assassins attempt to put an end to his life. A love triangle develops along the way that leads to a shocking conclusion with a strange twist. It is a thrill a minute and danger in every episode.
