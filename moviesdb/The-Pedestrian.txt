The Pedestrian

 Most of us walk to get from A to B. But there are those who are obsessed with getting to B quicker than everyone else. Jonathon Collins is such a walker. In fact, he's never lost a 'Walk Off' in his life. This is a statistic that he's a bit too keen to share with the world. But his love affair with walking is put in jeopardy with the arrival of a new fleet-footed nemesis. And there's also the cute Charity worker who always catches his eye. If only he could slow down long enough to chat to her.
