The Baron and the Rose

 The story of Henry Stiegel, a blacksmith in Elizabeth Furnace, Pennsylvania, who, in colonial days became a famous glass-maker, acquired land and wealth, and squandered it. As an old man he had given a lease on one of his properties to a church, with the rent to be determined later. Despite his financial condition, Steigel, always the artist, made the annual rent one red rose, which is why the church in Mannheim, Pennsylvania still paid it rent that way in the 20th century in 1940.
