The Brisbane Line

 A neo noir drama-documentary, The Brisbane Line depicts the forgotten history surrounding the subtropical capital of Queensland, Australia. Set in the shadows of this sunshine city's unsolved crime, the film explores gaps between fact and fiction, memory and myth and excavates Brisbane's original urban sin.
