The Search for Atlantis

 Ted Danson takes viewers on a spectacular 2-hour search for one of the greatest civilizations the world has ever known--the fabled Lost City of Atlantis. The epic journey spans the globe from the volcanoes of the Azores to the uncharted jungles of South America and even to the archives of Nazi Germany. This program also brings the glittering Lost City to life once again, with painstakingly recreated islands, harbors, palaces, and temples.
