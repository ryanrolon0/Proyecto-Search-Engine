 There's a guy who likes a girl who keeps vomiting up parasitic alien egg sacks who needs to be saved by two incompetent FBI agents who can't spell "incompetent FBI agents" who never fail to remind the fearful civilians of the impending ambiguous doom! A mysterious ball of light and fire falls from the sky and crashes in the woods outside a small rural vacation cottage in Crows End where Brad, Adrian, Rachael, and Jessica have come for a relaxing weekend retreat. Stunned by the horrendous event and strange sounds coming from the woods, the foursome enter the dark, foggy thicket and investigate the crash site. Unknowingly they witness what could be the end of all mankind. But can the bad news get any worse? Apparently it can, Rachael now has something evil growing inside her! Within hours, two clueless FBI agents emerge on the scene with more questions than common sense or training. Time is running out for Rachael and the survival of the planet. Can Agent Miller get his hands on a specialized device capable of eradicating the evil tumor-like growth inside Rachael and its diabolical plans for global infestation? With only one Type 11 Second Stage Micron Focal Wave Generator in existence, and Agent Miller at the controls of this classified operation, prospects don't look good. Hidden family secrets, dramatic love twists, and an investigation led by the FBI into the cause of Rachael's terrifying egg-laying parasite all make for a dangerous and hysterically bizarre search for the truth. Combining Sci-Fi terror with "not of this world" humor, Writer/Director/Producer Ryan Humphries tells the zany story of a hideous intelligence whose hunger for humankind had only a few small obstacles thwarting its plan - two FBI Agents who can't spell "hideous intelligence" and four young adults who stage a battle to claim back their peaceful rural retreat.
