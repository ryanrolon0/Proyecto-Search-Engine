Tchekhov, un Ecrivain au bagne

 100 years after Checkhov's death, this documentary traces the author's Odyssey and urges us to rekindle Checkhov's views on his eternal Russia. Interweaving past and present, and as a counterpoint to the film journey, we listen to excerpts of Checkhov's texts and to the echoing voices of lost populations scattered over this huge continent and throughout the half forgotten Sakhalin island.
