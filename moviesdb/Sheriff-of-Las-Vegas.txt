Sheriff of Las Vegas

 When the Sheriff of Las Vegas is killed in a bank holdup, Red Ryder is made the new Sheriff. His first problem arises when the Judge is shot and the Judge's son framed for the murder. Red knows the son is innocent from the type of bullet used and after hiding him from the lynch mob, sets a trap for the man he thinks is behind both the robbery and the murder. Judge Blackwell requests his banker, Arthur Stanton, to bring a list of his securities so that he can disinherit his wild young son, Tom Blackwell. When his father is found murdered, Tom is accused. Knowing the boy to be innocent, Sheriff Red Ryder hides him in a school house and them makes certain that Stanton is aware of it. A mob storms the school and gunplay ensues. Red notes that one of the gang is firing a Derringer, the type of gun used in Judge Blackwell's murder. The gunman is mortally wounded and confesses his part if the framing of Tom. Red pulls a ruse which forces Stanton to confess he had the Judge murdered to hide the fact he had embezzled his funds.
