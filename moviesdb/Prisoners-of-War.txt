Prisoners of War

 A group of American soldiers are left behind after a battle in a French city during World War II. The soldiers take refuge in an abandoned dwelling where they discover a cowering German soldier whom they take prisoner. The soldiers debate whether or not to execute the German and express divergent points of view based on their own ideas of morality, humanity, and the rules of war. Eventually they turn on one another and are brought to violence. In an attempt to ease the tension the German soldier offers a reminder of their own humanity and causes them realize they are all the same. They are all soldiers. They are all human.
