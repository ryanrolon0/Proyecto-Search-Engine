Stepdad

 The harrowing story of a young boy called Billy, forced to endure years of abuse by his wicked mother and vicious stepfather. With no support from his two frightened sisters, Billy is constantly beaten; he is physically and mentally abused and made to feel worthless. This story highlights the harsh struggle that many children experience, in a culture of parenting that too often, goes unpunished. Fearing for his sanity, self respect and indeed his life, Billy has to live with the constant knowledge that he is not wanted and should never have been born. His alcoholic parents have no love to offer and push Billy as near to breaking point as you could possibly dare to imagine. Surprisingly, Billy grows into a very respectable person, who against all odds, manages to leave the care of the local social services children's home and make a very successful life of his own. After the constant flashbacks of his childhood abuse, Billy decides that the time has come for his mother and stepfather to be made accountable for their ill treatment of him. With the support of his new wife, the mother of his six year old son, Billy makes a complaint to the local police and strikes up a great friendship with a police officer, Detective Sergeant Robert Edwards. Years after the abuse took place; The Police, The Crown Prosecution Service and Billy are ready to go trial. With no evidence, no witnesses that are willing to come forward and ultimately a landmark legal case at The Crown Courts in Manchester, Billy is forced to confront his parents in the witness box and ask the jury to take his word over theirs. Will he get the closure he needs to carry on with his life or will his abusive parents be free to leave the dock. A fantastic insight into one person's fight for justice and to two parents who know the truth, but refuse to admit that they have done anything wrong.
