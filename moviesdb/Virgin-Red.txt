Virgin Red

 A few days after his arrival in the war zone, Juan and his patrol partner, RICO, stumble into a situation, which rapidly unravels beyond their control. Rico, having apprehended an insurgent, loses his grip on proper operational conduct and, in a flash of rage and fear, pulls the trigger. In the ensuing chain of events, all protagonists' lives take a turn for the worse. The story is inspired by true events. Swiss director Edouard Getaz consulted extensively with Kevin Mervin, author of UK bestseller Week-end Warrior (the diary of a UK soldier during Gulf War II).
