Quando o Anjo e o Diabo Colaboram

 Inspired in the Play "Auto da Barca do Inferno" by Gil Vicente, the only Portuguese playwright recognized in the universal history of theater, the story of "When The Angel And The Devil Cooperate" talks about a bet world ended, where would most of the humans end up? In Heaven? Or in Hell? On Earth, the Angel and the Devil come across with the story of a father, Parvo, who blames his daughter's death on Onzeneiro. While Parvo looks to get his revenge on Onzeneiro, this one tries to get rid of the murder charges by paying of the judge. They both gather with their accomplices at the same place, a brothel, without knowing about each other's presence. Here alliances are formed and broken with the help of peculiar friendships, represented by the characters of "Auto da Barca do Inferno".
