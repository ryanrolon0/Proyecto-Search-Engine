Sobre mi piel

 An interesting look at middle age crisis and the various ways to get through them. Marina, a thirty-something photographer returns from an unsatisfying job. She tries to write on her diary but finds her pen swerving into her forearm. She begins to write all sorts of insults on her body as she enters into a frenzy. She quickly runs out of writing space and sheds off her clothes as well as her hard nosed facade. She carries on until she's able to see, underneath all the ink and shadows, her smiling face, and she likes what she sees.
