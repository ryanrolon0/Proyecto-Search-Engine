The Love Song of Iskra Prufrock

 The story of Iskra - a Croatian refugee who works as a Radiologist in an inner city surgery. In an effort to recover from her violent past, Iskra has made her life one of ritual - every day she takes the very same train to the to the very same job in the very same building. But she finds that her new life is a lonely one and, despite the odd imaginative trip into fancy when the tedium of her everyday world gets the better of her, devoid of true happiness. That is of course until she meets Leo... However it would seem that for Iskra, even love was not meant to be easy...
