The Other Mother

 Luigi Cozzi talks about the production of his 1989 film Demons 6 Profundis, the little seen "sequel" to Inferno that was released under the title "The Black Cat". This featurette was made for the nationwide UK DVD and Blu Ray release of Dario Argento's classic horror epic Inferno.
