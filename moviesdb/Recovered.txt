Recovered

 Recovered - Journeys Through the Autism Spectrum and Back documents four children who have recovered from the Autism Spectrum. Each child received services from the Center for Autism and Related Disorders Inc. (CARD), including assessments, supervision, parent/teacher training and one-on-one behavioral therapy. The film presents documentation of therapy sessions along with interviews of the children who are now teenagers, their parents, therapists and the founder/executive director of CARD. Their combined stories illuminate both their struggles and triumphs while providing hope to families of newly diagnosed children that recovery is indeed possible. The film also includes DVD Extras designed to educate families who are navigating the world of autism and autism treatment.
