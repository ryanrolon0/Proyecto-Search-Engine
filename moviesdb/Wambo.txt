 After a hard and unpleasant childhood, Herbert Stiegelmeier finds his place on the stages and sets of Bavarian film and theatre productions. His reputation is unscathed, and after years of increasing fame, he has established himself as a typical Munich original in the minds of the people all over Germany. All those years nobody even suspected his other self, his attraction to homosexual S&M practices, his affairs with paid love slaves and his dedication to pain and suppression. One day, Herbert Stiegelmeier is found murdered - hammered to death - at the height of his career. Based on the biography of famous Bavarian actor Walter Sedlmayer and the still not completely solved mystery of his death.
