Seeing with Rudy Burckhardt

 Artist, painter, photographer, filmmaker Rudy Burckhardt explains his aesthetic (voice only) and demonstrates his techniques. With many film excerpts, Burckhardt's own voice and comments by critic Faubion Bowers. Plus still pictures of Burckhardt at work on location and in his studio. Burckhardt was born in Switzerland and has worked in several media, including still photography, film, and paint. At this time he was experimenting with painting on images projected onto his canvas. He was one of the earliest "time lapse" photographers, a technique by which processes that may take weeks or months to achieve in real time are compressed to a few minutes. Included here are excerpts from his films "Pursuit of Happiness", documenting the patterns of pedestrians on a New York City street; "See Naples and..." examining ordinary moments in the life of a busy Italian city; "Haiti", images from the island nation; "Doldrums" about Jersey City, N.J.; "Trash Lives", glorifying the banality of what we leave lying on the streets; and "Caterpillar", a time-lapse view of a day-long journey by an inchworm -- presented in one minute.
