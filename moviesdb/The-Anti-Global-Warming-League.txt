The Anti-Global Warming League

 Warm weather during January has got some kids' hopes of a snow day at an all time low. They band together like super-heroes and try to attack global warming on their own. When their efforts aren't enough they reach out to the adults. Working together they all find that even when you get what you want it might not come out how you want.
