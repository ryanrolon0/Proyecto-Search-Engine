The Privateer

 The Privateer follows five "privateers"- professional motocross riders riding without factory sponsorship on the national motocross circuit- looking into their routines and struggles. From mechanics punching out locals outside honkytonks in Missouri, to hijinks in ice cream parlors in the Rocky Mountains, we witness through an unflinching camera the riders' daily struggle just to get to the next race. 7-time world champion Rick Johnson and others are interviewed, shedding light on the trials and tribulations that the independent rider endures.
