The Gullible Canary

 A hobo crow doesn't want to fly south. He spots a canary in a cage and decides the plush life of a captive is for him, so he convinces the canary to change places for freedom and a chance at love. The canary barely escapes a hawk, flies into a clock tower just as it strikes noon, recovers from that just in time to escape a cat, joins a flock of geese, barely surviving the hunters. He flies into a snowstorm, and the severe icing on his wings downs him. Back to the crow, whose cage is now looking very seedy. The canary has returned; he relates his adventures, then introduces the wife move back in.
