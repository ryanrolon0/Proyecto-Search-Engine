The Famishing

 Two bedraggled survivors trek their never ending mountainous terrain in the search of food and hope. Spotting what seems to be a fellow survivor in the distance, they head over to try their luck. But one of them harbors a secret, and when events do not go as expected, the cat leaps out of the bag with horrifying consequences. Their relationship under pressure, and an unflinching, hungry adversary on their tales, the two find themselves facing issues of trust, loyalty, and survival.
