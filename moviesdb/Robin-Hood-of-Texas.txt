Robin Hood of Texas

 When the bank is robbed, Gene and the boys are singing nearby and the Chief arrests them as gang members diverting attention but lets them go thinking they will lead them to the others. Duke Mantel double-crosses the rest of the gang and with the money, accidently heads for the dude ranch where Gene is. The rest of the gang eventually show up to retrieve the money just as Gene and the boys find themselves locked in a building.
