The Blind Trail

 Bob Carson and his pal Hank O'Hara are wandering through the west and stop at a western cafE and get into an argument with bad guys Mort Van Vlack and Al Sinclair. Alice Bartlett, recently orphaned, rides to town and pays money lender William Skinner on a note he holds against her late father's ranch. She does not know the note is a forgery made by Skinner and his henchmen Mort and Al. The latter dust off Skinner after an argument over how to split the money. Carson goes to Skinner's office, and is leaning over the dead man's corpse when the Sheriff shows up and arrests him for the killing.
