The Man That I Was

 The Man That I Was tells the tale of a transformational trip taken by a young Texas native (Dave Cole) who can no longer cope with the life he's built for himself in Los Angeles. Dave leaves job, home and girlfriend abruptly, taking only his beloved companion and closest confidant, his dog Preacher, back to Dallas in an attempt to find something that will make his life feel more complete. Along the way Dave discovers that self-imposed exile and escapism often come at great cost.
