The Arirang Blues

 Even though we think we are living in the present, we live in both the past and present simultaneously because of our nature to going back to the past. I made 'Arirang Blues' by the inspiration from many artists who struggle daily. 'Arirang Blues' is a 3rd experimental film trilogy followed by 'Conflict Resolution'(1st, 5min 2009) and 'Boundary' (2ND 30min 2010).
