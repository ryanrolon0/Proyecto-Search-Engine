Raw, Exposed, Untold

 This unique behind-the-scenes documentary deals with the everyday trials of exotic male dancing in North America. The film aptly shows how male dancers have to cope today with the numerous hardships caused by a steady decline of this exotic industry. Audiences will learn what does it take for the male dancers to survive in this rather competitive and demanding exotic industry. At the same time, the film allows the viewer - for the first time - to go behind the scenes and see what is on the other side of the stage, something that has never before been seen on TV.
