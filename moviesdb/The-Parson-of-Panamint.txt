The Parson of Panamint

 The mayor of wild and woolly mining town Panamint, in San Francisco to fetch a preacher for the new church, happens upon young Philip Pharo, as handy with his fists as with a sermon. Arrived, it appears to Philip that some of the town's "bad" folks are better than the "better element." When he sets out to better the lives of the miners and bring flagrant sinners into his flock, the "godly" folks are of course outraged. What form will their retribution take?
