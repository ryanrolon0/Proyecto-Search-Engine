Så kom de blå baretter

 The shocking story of the horrible side effects to the UN peacekeeping mission in Cambodia in 1992-1993. 25,000 children were born and abandoned after sexual relations between UN officers and local prostitutes and the UN intervention also trailed one of the worst AIDS epidemics in Asia. The orphanaged children are left to work as slaves or prostitutes to sustain themselves. Meanwhile, the UN denies responsability, declaring that the issue "is not its priority".
