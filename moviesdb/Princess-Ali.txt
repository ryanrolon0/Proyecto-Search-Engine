Princess Ali

 In the background, three accompanists stand, one beating a tambourine, another playing a flute, and the third (only partially visible) clapping. In the foreground, Princess Ali, dressed in North African clothes and waving a scarf in each hand, dances; after a slow turn, she lays the scarves on her shoulders, faces the camera, and undulates. Then, rhythmically, she turns again.
