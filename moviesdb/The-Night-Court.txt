The Night Court

 New York's Finest raid the Paradise Night Club on West 45th Street, "where everything goes, including your bank roll." In court the next day, the defense attorney asks that each person charged be allowed to perform. Dolly Lewis, arrested for singing risquE songs, does "I ain't that kind of a baby." The orchestra plays from the jury box. The chorus line, held for murdering the black bottom, performs in frills and bathing costumes. The judge and the defense hold a colloquy about a dead waiter. Then, Irene Tobasco, charged with an improper dance in scanty attire, performs in a diaphanous gown with a bare midriff. Is she "raw" or "well done." What will the judge decide?
