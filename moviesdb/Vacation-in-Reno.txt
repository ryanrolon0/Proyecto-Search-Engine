Vacation in Reno

 Jack Carroll and his wife have a phony argument to teach their friends a lesson, but when he makes a crack that her mother is a "fat porpoise," they fight for real and she leaves him. To make matters worse, Jack runs into two men just before they don masks and rob a bank. Now he is the only one who can identify them. In spite of all this, he takes a vacation in Reno; he is convinced he can use a metal detector to find buried treasure and realize his dream of starting a rabbit farm. Coincidentally, the bank robbers make their getaway to Reno and check into the same dude ranch as Jack. In fact, they bury a suitcase full of the loot and who should find it but hapless Jack himself. This is the just beginning of Jack's troubles, as he finds himself at odds with a deputy sheriff, a roughneck sailor and a gun moll who tries (for complicated reasons) to convince the police she is Mrs. Carroll. Worst of all, Jack's wife arrives and wants a divorce. Before this mess is cleared up, Jack will risk life and limb on a runaway stagecoach.
