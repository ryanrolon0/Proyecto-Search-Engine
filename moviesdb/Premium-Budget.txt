Premium Budget

 Don Costin runs 'Premium Budget Coffin Designs'.He is not particularly skilled in design, sales technique or running a business. Don's sees his sister in laws terminal illness as a chance to prove to his community that he is a man, a man with a successful business. When Don manipulates the family into letting him 'take care' of the funeral arrangements, Don reaches for the heavens to pull it off, but only success in creating hell.
