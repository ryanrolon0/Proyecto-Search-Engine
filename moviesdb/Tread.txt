Tread

 No plot to this as such. It's basically a road movie where the two main stars, who are top mountain bikers, strap a dozen or so bikes to a beat up old estate car and travel around the US visiting all the best places to bike. This includes Slickrock and Moab of which you see some very nicely shot biking. Not really a movie for non-mountain bikers but if you are it provides some inspiration.
