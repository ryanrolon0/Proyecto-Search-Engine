Vote Hunting

 Vote Hunting is a short subject documentary piece that focuses on John Kerry's misadventures in rural Ohio as a means of understanding his greater failings as a candidate. In particular, the film uses Kerry's decision to go hunting in Ohio 12 days before the election as an iconic image that sums up exactly what was wrong the Kerry candidacy.
