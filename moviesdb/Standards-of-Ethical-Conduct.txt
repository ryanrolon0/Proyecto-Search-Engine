Standards of Ethical Conduct

 For those who work in big corporations, the antics that occur at FCT, an URBM company, will be all too familiar. In 'Standards of Ethical Conduct', they'll follow the story of Heff, a cubicle-dweller who finds himself in conflict with his company's nightmarish code of conduct after an unfortunate incident at the annual company Halloween party. Last Comic Standing semi-finalist Chuck Roy co-stars as Heff's stoner roommate, a man pursuing a very different sort of American Dream.
