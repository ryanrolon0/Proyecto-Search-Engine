The Black Waters of Echo's Pond

 Nine friends take a holiday at a Victorian home on a private island and uncover a game that when played brings out the worst in each of them. Jealously, greed, hatred, lust, all of the things they keep buried deep inside themselves rise to the surface and come to a boil. The Black Waters of Echo's Pond shows those who look into it what they want to see... but what you want to see isn't always the truth.
