Une annEe au front, les coulisses de 'Un long dimanche de fiancailles'

 This 74 minute documentary captures the film's beginnings on storyboards and goes through every creative step. No interviews, no observations, no recalling memories. There's just footage of whatever happened as it was happening costume fittings, creating disfigured bodies, dialogue replacement, editing, composing... If that's not enough, there are, on the same DVD, shorter segments on the creation of 1920s Paris and the zeppelin explosion.
