Shao Lin shi san gun seng

 The invading Manchu army leed a vicious attack on the Shaolin Temple, seeking to destroy all its 3,000 master monk-fighters at the Shaolin Temple. The monastery's only hope is that (despite being drunk due to treachery) the monks will still beat their attackers to death, in countless one-on-one kung fu duels to the death.
