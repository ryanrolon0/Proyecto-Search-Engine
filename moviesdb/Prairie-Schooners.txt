Prairie Schooners

 Being unable to grow crops and pay their land owner Stull due to the drought, Wild Bill gets a group of Kansas farmers to form a wagon train and head to Colorado. Stull is afraid they will ruin his fur business in Colorado and sets out to stop them. He gets there first and giving guns to the Indians, gets them to attack the train. Wild Bill Hickok arrives in a Kansas town just in time to stop the enraged farmers from lynching Dalton Stull, an unscrupulous money-lender, who is foreclosing all their mortgages, after having his henchmen led by Will Tanner, burn, loot and destroy the crops and herds of the settlers. Bill offers to arrange a peaceful settlement, but when this fails, he suggest that the farmers migrate across the border into Colorado. Bill is leading their procession of covered wagons when a band of Indians attack the schooners, incited by Stull who also fears they will interfere with his lucrative fur trade in Colorado. During the attack, Virginia Benton is kidnapped. Bill and his friend, Cannonball, devise a scheme whereby the girl and the wagon train are saved after a desperate battle.
