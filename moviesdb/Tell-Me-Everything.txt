Tell Me Everything

 Tell Me Everything is a seven-minute film of hands in motion. A dance by Andrea Nann is intercut with documentary shots of hands at work-ranging from massage therapists to bread makers, from a chef on the cutting board to a dancer on the barre. A poetic narrative suggests a conduit of courtship, argument, sex and procreation. Framed by aquatic images, the film becomes a fluid assembly line of unconscious intent. There is no dialogue, only music. John Gzowski's original score features contributions from Leonard Cohen and Anjani Thomas.
