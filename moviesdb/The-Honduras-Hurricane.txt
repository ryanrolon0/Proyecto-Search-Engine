The Honduras Hurricane

 John has captured the Captain. He proposes a boxing match Honduras Hurricane, against the Captain's, which John will provide scrawny thing that's been kept in the fridge. The boys, spying through a window, see this and realize the Captain hasn't got a chance, and if he loses, John will take his house. Fortunately, there's a very feisty baby eagle nearby. The kids capture it and pull a switcheroo, and before long, the eagle has made short work of the Honduras Hurricane, forcing John to make good on his side of the bet and eat his boxing ring.
