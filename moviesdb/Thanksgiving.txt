Thanksgiving

 On a day when everyone is giving thanks, four friends sat down for Thanksgiving dinner. With a knock at the door, the young couples thought they were helping another person in need, but instead found themselves living a horrific experience by being bound, beaten, tortured and killed. This film is based on actual events!
