The Doppelganger Principle

 Criminal defense attorney Herman James has problems. Herman is overweight, diabetic and walks with a cane. He is also bombastic, wickedly witty and a major pain-in-the-ass to the Alaska Criminal Justice system. Further, his newest client has been charged with being the vicious serial killer who has butchered eight young women. Unfortunately, his client's blood was found at the last crime scene. Herman is faced with an extremely hostile judge, a prosecutor who wants to win at any cost, indisputable DNA evidence, and a client who wants to plead guilty despite the fact that Herman thinks he is innocent. Things only get worse when his client is stabbed almost to death in the courtroom by the grieving father by one of the dead girls. When all seems to be lost, Herman is shown that something in the evidence may not be all it is cracked up to be. Based upon very real and recently proven science, he uses his wits and legal slight-of-hand to lay a trap for the prosecution and then brilliantly uses their own witnesses against them.
