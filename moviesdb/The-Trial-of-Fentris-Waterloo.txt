The Trial of Fentris Waterloo

 Fentris Waterloo wakes up packs his doll Luisa into a doctor bag and takes her on a walk to Simon's lair, where they perform a ritual intended to transform the doll into a human. After Fentris is unable to bestow enough passion into the ritual, Simon becomes irritated and sends Fentris home. Fentris confides in another doll, his best friend Herberto a Mexican mariachi. Fentris plays the flute for Luisa then sets her on her pedestal and goes off to bed. After having a nightmare that Luisa and Herberto are having a secret affair, Fentris wakes up and finds the two dolls together. He strangles Luisa in the bathtub and hangs Herberto from a noose and goes back to bed. When he awakes, a life size Herberto is in bed next to him, so he hits himself over the head to call a consultation with himself. Fentris splits into three images of himself, dressed like doctors. They decide that Herberto is only a doll, and they throw him into a trash can and light him on fire. Then Herberto comes back, burnt to a crisp, so Fentris challenges him to a sword duel. Herberto wins the duel, and Fentris runs outside only to find himself in a courtroom where Simon is the judge. He is forced into participating in a game show called The Wheel of Destiny which will determine his fate. He spins the wheel and is sentenced to eternal life as a doll.
