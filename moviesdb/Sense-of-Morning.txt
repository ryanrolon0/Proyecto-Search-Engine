Sense of Morning

 On the last night of the siege on Beirut during the war of 1982, a young Palestinian poet strives to reach the kitchen in order to observe his everyday routine of coffee and cigarette, despite the plight of the war going on around. The film is inspired by Memory of Forgetfulness by Mahmud Darwish - 1987.
