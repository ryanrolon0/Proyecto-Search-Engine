The Border Wireless

 Cowhand Steve Ransom discovers that German spies are operating along Mexican border, relaying their radio messages into Mexico and thus on to Germany. The spies learn that Steve is a fugitive from American justice. They attempt to use this information against him when he tries to expose the spy ring and prevent the Germans from carrying out a plot to kill General Pershing.
