Prancer Returns

 Pre-teen brothers from a broken marriage live with their mother in a rural town. Ryan, the cheeky elder boy, wants to go to their father, Mat, in Chicago. This confuses shy Charlie, the youngest, who is also the butt of bigger school kids' often mean pranks. Then Charlie finds two reindeer on his way home from school which he believes to be Santa's called Prancer and his son and heir, also called Prancer, which he tries to hide at home. Ryan's help bonds the brothers again. Alas when Prancer gets out, evil vice-principal James Klock is bitten and wants the 'public danger' put down. Charlie runs away with his protEgE. His mother is useless, but her ex, handyman Tom Sullivan, comes to the youngsters' rescue.
