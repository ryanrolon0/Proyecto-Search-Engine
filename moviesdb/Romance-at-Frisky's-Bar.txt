Romance at Frisky's Bar

 Everybody comes to Frisky's Bar looking for love -- or at least a warm body -- but since patrons rely on smooth moves, cagey schemes and outright lies, it can be tough to know if real romance ever stands a chance. But as the bartender spouts his impenetrable philosophies and frat boys encounter cougars on the prowl, one couple discovers the spark of something that may be the real deal.
