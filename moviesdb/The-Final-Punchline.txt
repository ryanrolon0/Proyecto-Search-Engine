The Final Punchline

 Jason Rees is a twentysomething stand-up comic living the good life until doctors discover a malignant tumour growing in his brain. Reeling from the knowledge that the tumour is inoperable and suffering the side effects of the very drugs that are supposed to make him feel better, Jason does the unthinkable. He makes the decision to quit treatment, choosing quality of life over quantity, and to live what time he has left to the fullest. He returns to the stage, mocking the tumour and taking comfort from his audience.
