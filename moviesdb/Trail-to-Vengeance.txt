Trail to Vengeance

 Jeff Gordon and "Hungry" Huggins arrive in Twin Forks to find that Jeff's brother has been murdered, supposedly by another rancher, Bart Jackson. The bank, which holds a mortgage on the ranch, is about to foreclose on the widow, Alice Gordon. Dorothy Jackson, the daughter of the accused rancher, asks Jeff and "Hungry" for their aid in proving her father innocent. Jeff is able to prove that bank president Foster Felton, who is after both ranches, is the man behind the killing.
