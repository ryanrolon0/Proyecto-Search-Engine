The Sadness

 A depraved couple abuse and eventually sell their own young daughter for drug money, where she is then given to a group of psychopathic wannabe satanists who kill her as a sacrifice. From the grave she rises to seek revenge on those who have caused her pain, using evil henchmen to torture and mutilate them one by one in the most brutal, disgusting ways possible.
