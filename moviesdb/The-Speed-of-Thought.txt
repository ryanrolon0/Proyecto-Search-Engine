The Speed of Thought

 Joshua Lazarus (Nick Stahl) possesses a special gift that enables him to read people's minds, and the government has trained him to use his ability for deadly missions involving national defense, all while telling him that it will ultimately destroy him --- but will it? When Joshua falls in love with Anna (Mía Maestro), another telepathic "scoper," he and his friend, Kira (Taryn Manning), must find a cure for their gift and expose the lies.
