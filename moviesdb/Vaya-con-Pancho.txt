Vaya con Pancho

 PANCHO is a crime-fighting graffiti artist in the Third World. As a child, a construction rod pierced his brain, which left him unable to perceive fear. Now he can face villains such as Paco Vargas, the dirty police commissioner. Produced in Guatemala, using the same techniques as Sin City and 300, entirely green screen.
