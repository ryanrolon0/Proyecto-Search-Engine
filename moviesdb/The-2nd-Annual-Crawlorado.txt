The 2nd Annual Crawlorado

 Experience 80 minutes of battle between man, machine, and nature. And expect to cringe when nature wins. See the axles smash, the rubber spin, and the steel snap. Hear the gears grind, the bodywork cave, and the crowd cheer. Held in Kremmling, Colorado, The 2nd Annual Crawlorado is an annual membership drive hosted by the Colorado Association of Four Wheel Drive Clubs Inc. A two day event that consists of over 60 vehicles, over 30 obstacles, and over 2000 spectators. The Crawlorado is an organized, judged, and scored event that spans an entire weekend. Obstacles are designed to test the limits of machinery, and a wide range of vehicle modifications are allowed. Witness unique military vehicles compete....Unimogs(Mercedes), The Swedish Tank Killer, Valpen(Volvo). And we don't forget the custom built, tube framed, stripped down, and jacked up, rock climbing machines.
