The Campaign

 Santo Cilauro wrote, filmed and directed this fascinating documentary on Paul Keating's 1996 election campaign told from the perspective of Cilauro who traveled in the media pool. The narration is surprisingly straight and monotonal for someone of Cilauro's proven comic potential, but an insightful documentary results. The retrospective importance of the election outcome adds to the documentary's worthiness.
