Sounds Good to Me

 A sobering "documentary" about the plight of a homeless man soon becomes an parody of a filmmaker with a subject he's unable to contain into his expectations of a street person. Soon the camera turns on itself-- the bum transforms into the grounding leader, the crew become cast, the intended story unravels, sound splits from picture, and the director's initial vision becomes the most unreal thing about the documentary.
