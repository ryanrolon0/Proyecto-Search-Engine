Remember Isobel

 All her life, Cathryn Bailey has seen herself as extremely lucky. She has a loving wife (Helen Martin), two beautiful though sometimes challenging young sons, and a mother (Isobel Bailey) who has been not only present but a key participant in every major moment of Cate's life. No matter what, Isobel has always found a way to lift her daughter up and instill a sense of indomitable strength in her family. When Isobel is diagnosed with Alzheimer's though, her ability to fulfill her role as matriarch and caregiver begins to unravel, and Cate suddenly finds herself struggling to care for everyone. Helen, the boys, Cate's brothers...everyone tries to find a way to help Cate with Isobel but, in the end, no one knows how to let this magnificent woman go. All they can really do is try to love the person that remains in the wake of this treacherous disease and always to remember, to REMEMBER ISOBEL.
