Recurring Dream

 Dr Ambedkar, India's first law minister, was born into the oppressed Untouchable caste and saw legislation was limited unless there was a radical cultural shift away from Hinduism. He and millions adopted Buddhism as a way forward. The film witnesses the aspirations of young orphans in Buddhist hostels, women living in a community discuss issues of marriage and a teacher steer crowds away from the path of caste resentment towards individual confidence. From north to south a "peaceful revolution" is happening.
