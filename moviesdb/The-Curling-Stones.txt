The Curling Stones

 Inspired by the Olympic sport of curling, Canadian artist Jason Young, creates a "curling" match installation out of highly polished aluminum "curling-stone" sculptures. The warm and cool color inlayed stones leak their colors as they glide down a rink of clear resin. "Sweepers" use blowtorches to accelerate the stones as they advance toward the target at the far end. The installation is complete when all eight stones have been thrown.
