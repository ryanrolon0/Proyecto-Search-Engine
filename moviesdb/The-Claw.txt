The Claw

 The Greenwich Village Halloween Parade maintains a rich New York City tradition, flooding the streets of Manhattan with tens of thousands of participants-in all their Halloween finery. The documentary short, The Claw follows an active participant, her costume and the annual commitment she makes to America's most popular Halloween parade.
