Until I Show You

 A young man sits at home watching TV with his grandmother when his friend, who he hasn't seen in a long time and resents a little because of this fact, comes over. The mood then begins to get more and more tense when this friend reveals the reason why he's come to visit. The banter between the two ensues about whether or not their friendship is still solid enough to put it through a sort of awkward and scary test, and the friends then begin to really explore different aspects of their friendship.
