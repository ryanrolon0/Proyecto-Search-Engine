The Wooers of Mountain Kate

 An odd character, this Mountain Kate; living in the hills, rather unkempt but strikingly attractive to three suitors who live in habitations identically the same as the object of their adoration. Kate selects the man of her choice, but one of his rivals soon manages to secure her for himself. A triangular struggle ensues, and after the excitement has subsided, Mountain Kate is again left to lead the lonesome life of a hermit.
