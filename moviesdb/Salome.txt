SalomE

 The story of SalomE told as one of extreme love and vengeance. A director prepares a troupe of flamenco dancers for a performance. He summarizes the story and describes his spring for the drama's action to John the Baptist. When the prophet rejects her, she seeks revenge. We meet the principals. We watch rehearsals, a dress rehearsal, and then the performance. The movie is both about the performance and about preparation for performance. A director is developing a ballet giving his interpretation to the biblical tale of Salome. He explains to the dancers and crew that in his version, SalomE is in love for John the Baptist. However, the rejection of her love associated to the poison of Herodias makes the revengeful SalomE plot an evil scheme against John the Baptist. When King Herod asks the seductive SalomE to dance for him, she makes him promises to give anything she wants. In the end of her performance, she demands the head of John the Baptist.
