Urban Surfer

 Ty is a keen surfie, trapped in the confines of outer Western Sydney. Unable to get to beach except in his imagination, Ty improvises and armed with his Malibu skateboard, rides the concrete waves of suburbia. Beautifully shot on 16mm, on location near Wollongong, the film is scored by a student from the Sydney Conservatory of Music, and is a stunning mix of drama, underwater dream sequences and skating action.
