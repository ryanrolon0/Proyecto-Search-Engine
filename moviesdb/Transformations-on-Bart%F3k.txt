Transformations on Bartók

 The fine-art animation 'Transformations on Bartok' is an original exploration of form and expressive mark-making. As I became captivated by Bela Bartok's violin duets, specifically the Ruthenische Kolomejka, I set about to craft abstract moving drawings that possessed, in their own way, the frenetic energy, atonality, and vitality of Bartok's work. I am intensely interested in the contradiction inherent in drawing on paper wish to explore sequential drawing in its intrinsic nature as a two-dimensional composition, its potential for building complex, three-dimensional forms, and the liminal space between these two states. I hope to leave the viewer with the energy of an original concept of moving form, expressive mark-making, and music.
