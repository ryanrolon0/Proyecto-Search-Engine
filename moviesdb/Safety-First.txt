Safety First

 Sound the alarm. From the award-winning filmmakers of 'Larry (the actor)' comes this tale of a safety expert, Dr. James Rose, and his rise to celebrity-like status in the Boston area. Told by beatnik versifier Adam Oh with the reckless abandon of a liquored-up preacher, this dense and deftly-paced short film recalls the rise of a local legend who made headlines by aiding under-privileged accident victims in their battles against corrupt, corporate defendants. Dr. Rose came to be known in the community as a real-world superhero, sporting his custom-made coveralls while behind the wheel of the Safety Mobile. But the untimely death of his wife, from an accident he could never explain, drove him down a path of inner destruction and early retirement. Oh offers an intense, crescendo-building performance that calls for the return of the man with the measuring tapes, mechanical pencils and sensible insights. "Rise Jimmy Rose from your thorny, toxic garden!"
