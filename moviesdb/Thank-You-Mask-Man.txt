Thank You Mask Man

 Tells how the Lone Ranger hooks up with Tonto. With Lenny Bruce doing all the voices, this animation of a Bruce routine begins with local folks upset at the Lone Ranger because he won't stay around to be thanked after a good deed. So, he stays and finds he likes hearing "Thank you mask man." When their attention starts to shift elsewhere, he shocks and disgusts the townspeople with a final request.
