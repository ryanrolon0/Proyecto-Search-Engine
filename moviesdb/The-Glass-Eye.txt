The Glass Eye

 A young man discovers his uncanny knack for videotaping breaking news events and becomes a video vigilante, plunging himself into the high-tech, cutthroat, laser-paced world of "guerrilla journalism." Equipped with a police scanner, video camera and a fast car, he cruises the streets at night alert to the calls reporting heinous crimes he can tape and sell to news stations. He gets good at it. So good, he often beats the cops to the crime scene. When he discovers he may have taped a serial strangler at a recent crime scene he sets out to prove it. He stakes out the strangler with the intention of secretly taping every move the man makes. But in time, the killer discovers the plan and turns the tables on our hero. Suddenly, our vigilante finds himself the prime suspect in the murders and must flee from the police while continuing his frantic search for evidence against the real killer.
