Traffic in the Sky

 A gentle yet complex young man tells his best friend about an amazing girl (Sarah) he met last night. In the course of his story, not only do we learn about his relationship with Sarah, but his past relationships as well. Each individual (Ryan, Sarah, Liane) discovers their own meaning of how past boyfriends/girlfriends affect their future relationships.
