Star Trek the Experience

 An attempt by some evil Klingons to kidnap visitors at The Las Vegas Hilton is foiled when the 24th century starship U.S.S. Enterprise transports them safely aboard. Taken to the bridge, the guests are told by Commander Riker that the Klingons plan is to disrupt the future time-line. Riker orders Lt. Commander LaForge to take them through the Klingon battle-zone and back to the 20th century aboard a shuttle-craft so that the time-line can be restored. A Klingon named Korath has discovered the perfect way to finally get rid of Captain Picard ancestor to the 24th century for execution. This ancestor also happens to be an unnamed member of a tour group in line to ride a Star Trek attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton in our time. Commander Riker and the Enterprise-D gang manage to divert the Klingon temporal transporter beam to themselves in an attempt to return the tour group to their own time.
