Poor Clementine

 Either Clementine is extremely clumsy or she's an abused housewife - at least that's what her friends assume when they look at her bruised body. But what most people don't know is that Clementine is deeply depressed without the bruises that hurt her so good. With seemingly nothing else to live for, Clementine seeks to change her situation in the only way she knows how - by taking her happiness into her own hands.
