The Irresponsible Mrs. Pennywise

 Traumatized and bedridden, a young woman violently lashes out at her kind older care-giver and retreats deeper into the walled-off world she has constructed consisting of her sick-bed, television and a pretty little doll. As this depressed dwelling turns against her, she must face terrifying secrets that manifest, pursue and ravage her. Can she escape the attack of this relentless wraith or will it be her demise?
