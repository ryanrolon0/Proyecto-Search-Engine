Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06

 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006 delivers ultra-realistic course environments for gamers who'd like to feel the tension, pressure and excitement of championship golf tournament play. Players are put to the test of making perfect tee shots or sinking tournament-winning putts in crunch time. Golf's greatest commentators return, as David Feherty and Gary McCord provide their commentary and irreverent observations on each round.
