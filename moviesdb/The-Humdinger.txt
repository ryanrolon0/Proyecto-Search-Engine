The Humdinger

 His duties as the bellhop, clerk, office boy, messenger and porter at the local hotel keep Johnny busy, but he still finds time to romance Lucille, the daughter of the proprietor. Lucille also finds time to become fascinated with George, a traveling salesman, while Anita, a vamping vamp from New York City, works her wiles on Johnny.
