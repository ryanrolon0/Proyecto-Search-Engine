Still Waters Run Deep

 A wife is convinced her husband is having an affair and one night decides to follow him when he sneaks out of the house. Driving through the suburbs of London, she follows him down a dark ally to a garage. To her shock horror she soon learns that whilst he is not cheating on her, his unusual drinking habit aids his peculiar desire. This quirky short touches on a taboo subject that's all together very natural.
