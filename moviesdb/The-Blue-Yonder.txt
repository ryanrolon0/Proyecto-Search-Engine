The Blue Yonder

 Have you ever thought of traveling through time... going forward or backward to any date? That's the intriguing question aviator/inventor Max Knickerbocker (E.T's Peter Coyote) asks 11-year-old Jonothan Knicks (Huckleberry Fox of "Terms of Endearment"). Max is unaware that Jonothan is his grandson - already an adventurous time traveller thanks to a machine built by his neighbour, Henry Coogan (Academy Award-winner actor Art Carney). Can Jonathan save his grandfather from a fatal solo flight across the atlantic and alter the course of history? 11-year-old Jonathan Knicks, a little league baseball player and fan of airplanes and flying, travels back in time to 1927 using his elderly neighbor's time machine to try to stop his young-at-the-time grandfather, Max Knickerbocker, a pilot and craftsman who is planing to fly across the Atlantic which will cost him his life.
