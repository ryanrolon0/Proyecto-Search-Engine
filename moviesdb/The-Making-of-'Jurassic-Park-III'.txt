The Making of 'Jurassic Park III'

 We look at the special effects and animatronics made for the motion picture, Jurassic Park III (2001). Interviews with the cast and crew give us a sneak peek at the film. The movie used many different new dinosaurs compared to the first two films, here we examine how they'll look in the final product. A brief look at the action for the film is also shown, but not to a great extent.
