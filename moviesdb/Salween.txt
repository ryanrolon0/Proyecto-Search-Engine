Salween

 The border of Burma and Thailand is lawless place, where people live and die by the law of the gun. Into this situation comes a young police lieutenant, intent on reforming the rough and rowdy local police force along the Salween River. But the ongoing fight by the Karen tribe against the Burmese government spills over into the Thailand, making the lieutenant's task a difficult one.
