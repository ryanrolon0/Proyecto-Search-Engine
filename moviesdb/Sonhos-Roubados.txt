Sonhos Roubados

 Jessica, Sabrina and Daiane have dreams, just like all young people of any social class or place in the world. They live in a low-income neighborhood in the periphery of Rio de Janeiro and find in prostitution a way to survive and satisfy their consumer desires. However, even faced with the trials of absolute uncertainty and lack of hope, Jessica, Sabrina and Daiane insist on loving, having fun and planning their future. The seventeen year-old single mother JEssica lives in a slum with her daughter Britney and her grandfather Horcio that repairs bicycles to survive. Her best friends are the also teenager Sabrina that was left by her mother, and the needy fourteen year-old Daiane that was left by her father and lives with her aunt and her uncle Peri. The trio prostitutes every now and then to raise money to survive and satisfy their simple wishes of adolescents. Jessica is hired to have sex in the prison with the inmate Ricardo that asks JEssica to quit prostitution and proposes her, but she does not see any hope in their relationship. Sabrina becomes the mistress of a criminal, but when she gets pregnant and decides to have the baby, her lover dumps her. Daiane misses her father and is abused by her uncle; when she befriends the hairdresser Dolores, the woman convinces her to denounce Peri.
