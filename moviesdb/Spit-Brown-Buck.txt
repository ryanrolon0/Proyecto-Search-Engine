 Maria Jose or "Majo" is an East LA slam poet who dreams of the wealth and fame and all that comes with a record deal. She is a tough-as-nails daughter who supports her younger sister and routinely visits her mother in prison. An impromptu slam session leads Majo to the opportunity of a lifetime with a notorious music producer. Assured that a record deal will be the first step on the fast track to success and feeling like she is on the verge of having the life she has always wanted, Majo is suddenly faced with some stark choices. Does she accept the deal and turn her back on her friends who brought her to the precipice of success or take the money and help with her mother's appeal? Majo must decide what she is willing to sacrifice in the pursuit of her dreams.
