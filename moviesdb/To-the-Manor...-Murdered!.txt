To the Manor... Murdered!

 Fridge magnate Howard L. Ormondagondastoneson has been murdered, but whodunnit?! Was it the young, trophy widow with a rack you could count your guns in? Was it the shifty business partner with one eye on the money, one eye on the wife and both hands in his pockets? Or how about the embittered ex-wife who's had to switch her weekly shop from Harrods to HyperValue? Or the fascist mother who's crazier than a bag of spanners and the 'street' chauffeur who doesn't know the difference between a drive-thru and a drive-by? Then there's that bearded priest... All have something to hide and all will be revealed once straight-shooting New York detective Larry Ringer is through with them! Suspended for shooting an fat nun in the back, the decorated detective happens to be caravanning nearby. En route to the airport he swings by the scene of the crime to see what he can do. He knows he'll have to dig deep and dig fast if he's going to catch the killer.
