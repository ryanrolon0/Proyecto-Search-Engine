Shopping Solo

 Ned Johnson has a fear of grocery stores. He has been able to avoid them his entire life. Ned recently moved into a fixer up house with his very pregnant wife, Crystal. After Crystal overhears Ned talking about how he does all of the 'real' work around the house, she decides to send him for some groceries as revenge.
