Transcending Bonds

 May 2004, ten members of the 75th Infantry Division returned to Belgium to see where the unit had fought in the Battle of the Bulge. They visited battle sites and cemeteries, and reunited with Belgian friends. The Belgians view the old warriors as the men who gave them back their freedom in 1945. This film weaves together the stories of the American veterans and the Belgian citizens. It illustrates their struggles of sixty years ago during World War II and the love and friendship that endure between these peoples.
