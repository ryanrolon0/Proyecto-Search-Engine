Waiting on Alphie

 A cafe in New York joins two men. Gus, flown in from Chicago, awaits the order on the cafE payphone to kill Alphie or let him live. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, they are in a standoff that turns minutes to hours. As today becomes tomorrow, the two find themselves discussing life, society, food -- and a secret from the past that comes crashing down. A cafE in New York joins two men.
