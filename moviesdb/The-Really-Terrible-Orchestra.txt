The Really Terrible Orchestra

 Established in 1995, The Really Terrible Orchestra provides refuge for the cream of Edinburgh's musically disadvantaged, where the use of sheet music is discouraged for being "too distracting". But who are these people who freely admit their lack of accomplishment, who frequently demonstrate their incapability to audiences in the hundreds? This documentary follows the orchestra's chairman as he prepares for an upcoming performance, interviewing the players and their cult following to find out why they play, and why oh why do people listen?
