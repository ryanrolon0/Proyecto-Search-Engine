The Longtermers

 Examines the lives of a group of travelers living full time in a backpacking hostel in Scotland. Sucked in by the attractive side of a carefree lifestyle they become trapped while searching for freedom, spending years in one over-crowded hostel. While challenging the viewer's perceptions of what constitutes 'normal,' the film asks the all important question of why and allows each person to come away with their own answer.
