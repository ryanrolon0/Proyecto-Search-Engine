The Tin Can Tourist

 Farmer Al Falfa and Puddy the Pup go on a trip with their modern trailer, which can double as a rowboat and comes packed with modern inventions. As Puddy takes over the driving, Al Falfa goes inside the trailer. He flicks a switch and out comes a hat rack, with hats for any occasion. Al Falfa takes the chef's hat, and then he pulls another switch and out comes a stove. He makes self-flipping griddle cakes for Puddy. He flicks yet another switch, and out comes the sink in order for him to do the dishes. Al Falfa lowers one side of the trailer, which doubles as a small yard. The automatic lawn mower mows the grass for him. They finally stop at the Tin Can Tourist Camp. While there, Al Falfa has a run-in with an angry bee, who enlists the help of his fellow bees to attack the farmer, his dog and even their anthropomorphic car.
