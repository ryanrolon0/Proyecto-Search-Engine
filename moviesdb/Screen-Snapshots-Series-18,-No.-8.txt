Screen Snapshots Series 18, No. 8

 Ice skating is the theme; at the Tropical Ice Garden, in Westwood Hills, are seen a flock of skating stars including Irene Dare and Phyllis Ann Thomoson, as well as Hollywood luminaries such as Franklyn Pangborn, Norma Shearer, Rita Hayworth, Mickey Rooney, Dick Purcell and Ann Sheridan. Hollywood stars are depicted as they show up at the Tropical Ice Gardens in Westwood Hills; some who are expert ice-skaters, some who are learning, and some who are there to just spectate and be seen. And one or two who show up everywhere there is a camera turning. And some because their studio told them to be there.
