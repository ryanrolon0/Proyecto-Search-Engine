VIgasioSexploitation Vol.2

 Space researcher Dr. Moreau, thanks to a lottery winning, manages to bring to Earth an alien who supposedly has a solution for the problem of desertification caused by the stopping of the terrestrial axis. The alien explains that on their planet, which is diametrically specular to the Earth, the indigenous population suffers from the opposite problem endless night. It emerges that the national lottery has been manipulated for years by the aliens, who finally get to open a gate and disembark onto the planet they want to conquer. The fecundating alien injects his semen in the body of Dr. Moreau's assistant, thus giving birth to a new breed that carries genes capable of saving both planets. However, the biker Osso, the woman's lover, kidnap her, causing the degeneration of the semen and the consequent metamorphosis of the assistant into a rabid dog. The dog's insatiable hunger for human and alien flesh ignites a chain of furious violence.
