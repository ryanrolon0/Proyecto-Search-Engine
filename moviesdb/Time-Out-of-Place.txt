Time Out of Place

 Sometimes time stands perfectly still, holding its breath. Time out of place is a film about these moments, elusive yet eternal. Sara stands on a balcony looking down at the city summer night. Everything that happens on the street seems to mirror her situation. It's a film about the moment you decide to break up. Everything that you once believed in still echoes inside of you, but you've already moved on.
