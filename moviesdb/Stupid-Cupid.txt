Stupid Cupid

 A beer-stained love letter following three working class Bay Area guys and how their friendship is based on their failures at dating. The guys decide to push their friend to the next level on dating by betting on how the next round of dates will go. While convincing themselves that they are merely looking for sex, they realize that they are entering into relationships.
