The Ticket

 Following her mother's unexpected death, a teenage girl decides that suicide is her ticket out of the sadness. She overdoses on pills, and travels along the road to the next world and meets a long-lost relative who shows her that she still has time to choose life. Does she? The Ticket follows 15-year-old Emma Stevens, portrayed by Alex Oliver, through her feelings about her mother's death and the loss of that family bond. As many teens go through difficult transitions in life, teen depression is on the uprise. Alex has attempted suicide and is flooded with memories of a "happy place" when her family was whole and together. She finds that there is a place between life and death where there is a "ticket" required to proceed into the afterlife. Her search for the ticket is also a search within herself to find the desire to live. She meets multiple characters who have found themselves in that same "grey" area between life and death.
