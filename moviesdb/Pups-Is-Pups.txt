Pups Is Pups

 Farina sees a newspaper ad offering jobs to "colored boys" to be pages at a fancy pet show; the rest of the gang imagines their pet winning a big prize. Whlle Wheezer tries to corral his five puppies, the other little rascals get their animals ready Jackie imagines winning a prize big enough to buy his first airplane. When they arrive downtown, will they be allowed to enter the contest? Meanwhile, Dorothy has no interest in the pet show; she just wants to put on a clean frock and jump in a mud puddle. What about Farina?
