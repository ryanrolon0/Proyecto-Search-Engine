Tina Makes a Deal

 This was one of many "One Day Wonders" produced in the Spring of 1973 for Star Distributors, which was the porno unit of the Gambino crime family. These films were budgeted at $5,000.and had a cast of six. "One Day Wonders" were simple, happy go lucky, good natured, sometimes funny sex movies. Nothing more. Nothing less.
