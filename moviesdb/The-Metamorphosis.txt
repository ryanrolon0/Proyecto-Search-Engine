The Metamorphosis

 An allegory - about the birth of a nation? Off-camera, a narrator tells us about the day Stan Leiber left. For a day or so, things had been odd has a headache, he feels a bump on the back of his head, he stares at himself in the mirror. The next morning, while his wife is cooking his breakfast, Stan gets in his small boat at the edge of the lake in front of their house, where a U.S. flag flies, and he rows away without a word. Where he goes, the reception he receives, and what appears on his head tells the rest of the story.
