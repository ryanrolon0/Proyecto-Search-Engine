Sol

 When reading the Greek myth of 'Phaeton', the story of a boy taking the reigns of Apollo's sun chariot and a force far larger than himself, I felt this related with the modern world. We have just begun to harness forces far bigger than us which has allowed science to travel further than ever before, and humanity continue their timeless quest into the unknown. I wanted to show space travel as a pinnacle and mythological event. Also, I wanted to display nebula beyond cold scientific calculation, but with a more poetical consideration, perhaps encouraging contemplation of these ideas
