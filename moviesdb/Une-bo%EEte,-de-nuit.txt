Une boîte, de nuit

 Montreal, a complete stranger gives Jeff a box. He is offered 5000$ in cash to bring it across town, but under no circumstances is he to look inside the box. Jeff accepts the offer, but juggles the idea to look in the box to satisfy his curiosity. Will he open the box? What will happen if he does?
