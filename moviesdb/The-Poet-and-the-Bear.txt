The Poet and the Bear

 Ruth is a seventeen-year-old girl in rural Northern Ireland, torn between the comfortable trappings of her childhood home, and dreams of a more exciting and culturally satisfying life. Enchanted by the romantic writings of French Poet Rimbaud, she awaits the results of her application to the best art college in Europe - the Paris School of Art. On the night before she receives news from the college, things then take a decidedly strange twist when Rimbaud shows up at her bedside and urges her to run away with him. In awe of her hero, Ruth follows him into the night, and they make their departure on Rimbaud's rickety old bicycle. Just as they are about to leave the farmyard however, they are stopped in their tracks by the sinister and aggressive appearance of Ruth's teddy bear - this time life-size and wielding a machete. It seems that escaping into her dreams will not be as easy as Ruth first thought.
