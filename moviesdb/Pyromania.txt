Pyromania

 Pyromania follows those with an unhealthy fascination for fire. From children who play with fire to the story of John Orr, thought to be responsible for setting over 10,000 fires to "Bob", a serial arsonist serving three life sentences in a mental institution, this film journeys into the state of mind when one doesn't set fires for revenge or money but for the simple love of fire itself.
