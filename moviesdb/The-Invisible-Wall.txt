The Invisible Wall

 A former GI returning from the war gets back his old job working for a bookie. Dispatched by the bookie to deliver $20,000 to a contact in Las Vegas, he foolishly loses some of the money at the gambling tables, then loses the rest of it to a conman. His attempts to recover the money result in his getting involved in mistaken identity and murder.
