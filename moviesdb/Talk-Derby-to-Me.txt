Talk Derby to Me

 Roller Derby is a highly competitive, often aggressive and always entertaining full contact sport for women. The Adelaide Roller Derby League is sustained by a diverse group of women who take to the track with valor and vitriol. Between bouts, however, they maintain a united community based on principals of female empowerment and resilient friendships.
