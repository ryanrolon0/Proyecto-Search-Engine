Tweety's Circus

 Sylvester Cat pays a visit to a closed-to-business circus and finds Tweety Bird in one of the cages. Tweety escapes his cage and flees Sylvester. Sylvester, meanwhile, must flee from an uncaged lion he had angered earlier. The chase results in Sylvester being pounded by an elephant, falling into an empty water tank, swallowing fire, and losing his balance on the high wire and falling into the lion's mouth. Sylvester locks himself in a cage thinking he is safe from the lion, only to find he has locked himself in with 50 more!
