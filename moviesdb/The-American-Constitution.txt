The American Constitution

 The American Constitution Christopher Reeve, guides young viewers through 600 years of political struggle from the Magna Carta in 1215 to the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. It examines the English roots of our Constitution, highlighting the political turmoil of 17th-century England and showing how such fundamental principles as "rule of law" and "limited government" emerged. Finally, viewers see how these principles were translated into American colonial government and sparked powerful clashes between the colonists and Great Britain, leading to the first attempt at national government, the Articles of Confederation.
