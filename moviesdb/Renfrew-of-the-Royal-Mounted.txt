Renfrew of the Royal Mounted

 Counterfeit bills are being printed in Canada and shipped across the border hidden in blocks of ice. When the counterfeiters force engraver Bronson to make a new plate, he inscribes a tiny help message on it. Renfrew catches a henchman who has one of the new bills. A magnifying glass lets him read the message and he heads out alone to round up the counterfeiters. Sergeant Renfrew and his dog Lightning hunt down a gang of currency smugglers, counterfeiters and the killer of a Mountie. All trails seem to lead to the Totem Pole Lodge resort, where Renfrew's culinary rival is cooking up a heap of trouble.
