Straight in the Face

 Steve and Elias are in the fourteenth year of their relationship, which has hit a rough spot due to Steve breaking what Elias sees as their open relationship agreement. Their relationship problem takes a back seat for an evening when they host a small dinner party for five, the other three being their female friends Antonia and Nicky, and Nicky's new boyfriend Daniel. Especially in Steve's mind, Daniel is obviously gay, as Daniel displays many of what society would call gay stereotypes. Steve and Elias call in a back up opinion in the form of another friend named Marilyn, who has a strong gaydar. If Marilyn supports their perception, Steve and Elias have to decide if they should confront both Nicky and Daniel with their suspicion.
