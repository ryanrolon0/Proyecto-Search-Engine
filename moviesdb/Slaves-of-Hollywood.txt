Slaves of Hollywood

 Slaves of Hollywood follows the lives of a group of recent college graduates at their first jobs in corporate Hollywood. Thomas, Pink, Fisher, Dean, and Roman have just moved out to Los Angeles and they aspire to become "players". But first they have to start at the bottom, working as personal assistants to a variety of maniacal producers, agents, and studio executives. The glamour of working in Hollywood quickly begins to fade after endless days of making coffee and babysitting the boss' children. As time moves on, our lead characters struggle to move up the corporate ladder while keeping their sanity and morals intact.
