Survive

 "SURVIVE" is based on a frightening series of brutal abductions and gruesome murders which took place across the American Southwest between for more than three decades, spanning the states of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. The true number of women who fell victim to these horrific crimes remains a mystery to this day. "The trick in writing the script was to make the subject matter something the audience could tolerate... I've seen almost every horror film made since the 1950's and the facts of this case were truly sickening. What you will experience in the feature length version of 'SURVIVE' is seriously watered down compared to the real facts. This short film is just the tip of the iceberg."
