The Wretched Auteur's 81,000 Frames

 This is a dark comedy about a solo film maker trying to figure out how he will complete a film he started with no help or resources. As he reaches his own conclusion of how he can accomplish his vision he finds himself going against everything he believes in spiritually. When he told a potential client he had zero money, one camera and no crew, he thought they told him to go mock himself!
