The Mad Dash

 As if losing his job, having his upcoming marriage postponed indefinitely and finding himself in eyeball-deep debt to a loan shark isn't enough, Dash Jeffries finds himself in custody of his late cousin's 11 year old son, Jordan. But life has a way of turning lemons into lemonade before it turns it back into lemons And that's the plight of these two opposites. Jordan, as it turns out is a Tiger Woods-type golf prodigy. When Dash finds out, he sees it as his way out of all of his problems. This takes the two of them on a "sting" and "run" international.
