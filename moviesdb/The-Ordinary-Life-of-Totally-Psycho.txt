The Ordinary Life of Totally Psycho

 A young Japanese woman studying in San Francisco agrees to star in the work of a fellow student and aspiring filmmaker. All she has to do is go about her everyday life for one week, while he films her with hidden cameras everywhere she goes, 24 hours a day. Although the task seems simple at first, unusual things begin happening around her, and she is no longer able to distinguish between what is her real life and what has been staged for the film.
