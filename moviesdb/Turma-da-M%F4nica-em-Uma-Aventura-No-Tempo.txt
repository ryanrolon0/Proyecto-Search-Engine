Turma da Mônica em Uma Aventura No Tempo

 Our heroes need to take a trip in time, in a Time Machine, in order to recoup the essence of the four elements before the Earth gets frozen. The Gang will face the dangers of the Ancient History with Piteco, will help Papa-Capim to save the Forest, will fight with the Astronaut against the pirates and will even meet themselves as babies in the past!
