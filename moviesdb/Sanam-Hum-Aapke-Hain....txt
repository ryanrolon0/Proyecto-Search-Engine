Sanam Hum Aapke Hain...

 Britain-based, yet believing in Hindu traditions and culture, Sonia Varma rebels against her mother, Kamini, who wants her to marry a boy from a local wealthy family, and warns her against getting involved with anyone from India as there is nothing but hunger, poverty, scams, illiteracy and corruption there. Sonia, with the assistance of her dad, Ramchandra, is introduced to a youth, Suraj Kumar, who she hires and eventually falls in love with - little knowing that Suraj is already involved with a woman named Rajni from his village.
