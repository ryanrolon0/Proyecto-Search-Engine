Solitude.

 Experimental surreal drama about two star-crossed couples' intertwining movies. Director Robert Joseph Butler plays traditional narrative structure, dividing his film into two loosely connected segments. The first centers on a lonely woman, Marcia who is searching for a connection. Her sad isolation is elevated when she encounters a offbeat slacker, named Barry. There connection is undeniably engaging. The second story explores the relationship between a beautiful woman Andie and Barry again, this time Barry is more handsome and more secure. Andie and Barry have the type of close intimacy right out of a Hollywood movie. Both stories present a unique and beautifully atmospheric look at stardom, cinema, romance, broken dreams, and the film industry.
