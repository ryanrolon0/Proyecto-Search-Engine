Un treno per ricordare

 The experience of visiting the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau told by a very different range of people politicians, middle-aged and old people; and even by who really had been deported in those "death camps" and survived to tell everybody about that terrible tragedy. All interviews are mixed up with archive footages.
