Procreation for a Better Australia

 A satire of 1950's public information films. Black and white, this film tries to instruct it's lead character, a 'war scientist', on the ways and means of dating and seducing, to encourage him to procreate 'for the good of our Commonwealth'. Of course, he struggles to impress the subject of his affections, with hilarious results.
