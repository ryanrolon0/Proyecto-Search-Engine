Up in the Cellar

 After a student loses a scholarship due to a computer glitch, he attempts to take his own life. During his suicide, however, he is stopped by the college president, who's currently running for the US senate. Since the student feels that by stopping his suicide, the college president has "killed" him, he gets back at him by seducing the man's wife, daughter, and black mistress.
