Shave

 Utilizing his family's own VHS home movies and weathered slide projector, writer/director Sean Christensen deconstructs a scene from his own childhood in this experimental documentary short. As its narrator, Christensen re-tells the story of himself as a young boy, whose world is changed forever when he sees his father without his mustache for the very first time. Expanding on themes from a single event, Christensen focuses on concepts of identity, filial relationships and the perpetual struggle of childhood. Peeling away the traditional layers of the personal narrative, Shave instead offers a stark, confrontational glimpse into the film-maker's own past-where the answers to the questions raised, lie only with the audience.
