The Horse

 This critically acclaimed 1973 short is about an aristocratic white farming family who has a horse that is being put away, by the father of a young black boy named William. William cares for said horse in it's last moments, as the male family members eagerly wait for his dad to eventually arrive. When the father shows up to put the horse out of it's misery, the drama moves at a quicker pace and the viewer is shown a slice of real life, as seen through the innocent but, eager eyes of a young child. I enjoyed this short subject immensely. As it captures reality better than most movies ever could or will.
