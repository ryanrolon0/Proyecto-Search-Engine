Villa Nova

 Kaya, a little girl living in suburbia, is tormented by her hyper annoying family. One night she hears something strange in the backyard. Instead of getting her parents, she decides to show her older brother and sister. The three kids investigate and discover two strange men hiding out in their playhouse. More excited than scared the kids attack the men while they sleep and chain them up as their hostages.
