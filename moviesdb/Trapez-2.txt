Trapez 2

 Trapez is the cinematic observation of a growing building site. The reality of construction and deconstruction is distorted by drawn elements and accelerated by a rhythmic luminosity. Using time-laps photography, the documentary of work, demolition and construction  becomes an homage to the urban absurdity.
