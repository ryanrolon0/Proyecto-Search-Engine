Shakespeare's Soliloquies

 Imagine having written thirty-eight plays...being an actor who became the most popular playwright of his time...and who's legacy was to become the most enduring playwright of all time. Imagine writing something some four hundred years ago, and having us stand here in a theatre today still exploring, enjoying, and marveling at those golden words? Join our troupe of actors in various stages of rehearsal, presenting some of the bard's most poignant speeches that have earned their illustrious place in the history of the theatre, and in all of literature.
