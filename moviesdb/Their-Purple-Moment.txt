Their Purple Moment

 Stanley and Oliver sneak out for a night on the town, unaware that Mrs. Laurel has substituted her grocery coupons for Stanley's secret stash of mad money. Of course, this results in dire consequences when the boys run up a huge tab treating a couple of girls to dinner at a snazzy nightclub. Stan and Ollie are holding back money from their pay envelopes from their shrewish spouses for a much-anticipated night on the town. Although the henpecked Mr. Hardy has had his secret stash discovered by his harridan of a wife, Stan is mistakenly confident that his his hidden wallet has escaped Mrs. Laurel's hawkish scrutiny. The boys go out for what is supposed to be a night at the bowling alley but end up in front of a local supper club. There they meet two flappers who have been deserted by their beaus and stuck with the tab plus cab fare. Believing they are flush with cash, Stan and Ollie gallantly volunteer to pay the girls' bills, and they reenter the club... but not before being spotted by the town gossip, who can't wait to inform on them. After ordering four steak dinners, Stan discovers to his horror that not only are the two helpless "damsals in distress" armed and dangerous, but his wallet contains only cigar coupons. The boys' purple moment occurs with the arrival of their termagant wives and a check they cannot pay.
