Polovetzian Dances from Prince Igor

 A CinemaScope Special short (production number 7405) which features Alfred Newman directing the 20th Century-Fox Symphony Orchestra in this work by Borodin. Ken Darby and the chorus accompany. This short is actually seven and one-half minutes (and not 8 minutes as submitted), but the IMDb guides don't appear to recognize fractions.
