Snow Gets in Your Eyes

 A department store has an indoor ski-slide for the annual contest for department store employees. Salesgirl June has two admirers; a sausage salesman in the store and the store's snooty ski instructor. But the sausage salesman goes into intensive ski-training, wins the contest and wins the girl. The Dandridge Sisters (Dorothy, Vivian and non-sister Etta Jones) do two numbers.
