Texas Trouble Shooters

 Denby wants the Wilson ranch for the oil he knows is there. After killing Wilson his men waylay Bret Travis who has become a half owner along with Judy Wilson. After Alibi finds the wounded Travis, he overhears Denby introduce another man as Bret Travis. The Range Busters then go into action under assumed names but are in trouble when their true identities become known.
