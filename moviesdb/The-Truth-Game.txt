The Truth Game

 When novelist Eddy and his working wife Lilly invite two couples to dinner to greet the return of a long-absent friend, questions of fidelity and loyalty between thirty-something friends quickly arise and entangle the dinner of pasta and wine. Ambitious Dan and Charlotte are close to a falling out, and Alan and Alex are living on the edge of disaster, when Kate, the local cocaine runner, suddenly appears, seeking shelter from the police. Amid mixed feelings of guilt, remorse, unrequited love, anger, and anxiety, Eddy proposes that they play "The Truth Game" to cap the explosive evening.
