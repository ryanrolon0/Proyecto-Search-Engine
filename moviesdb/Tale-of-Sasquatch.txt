Tale of Sasquatch

 "Sasquatch" chronicles the misadventures of Rupert (or Woopert, as he would say) as he begins his search in the woods for food, since "winteh is c-c-coming and f-f-food will soon be scahce." Frankly, though, Rupert could be anybody "wrong" with you -- and discovering that it's okay to be different.
