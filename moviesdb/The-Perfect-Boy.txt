The Perfect Boy

 The Perfect Boy is an experimental film, interweaving a twisted surrealist fairytale and real to life suburban mystery of mistaken identity. Hidden within non-narrative rhythms of opulent secrecy and sonic textual myths; two worlds of darkness and light, illuminate a truth lost within a seductive cinematic fire of breathing lies, formed with sound and vision. A monster is on the loose in the woods. A white child is missing. A charismatic boy weaves a dark fairytale that paralyzes a society of masked children in fear.
