Sleeping River

 Interweaving breathtaking expanses, wounded characters and a psychological method of editing to create an indelible return home for Tim, who can't seem to remember the details of a traumatic event from his childhood. Set in Colorado's north eastern grasslands, 'Sleeping River' takes full advantage of a landscape of austerity and abandoned places, where the constant wind, sun and sand have kept wounds from heeling for those who have never left.
