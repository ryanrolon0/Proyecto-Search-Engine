Resident Alien

 "Resident Alien" mixes comedy, science fiction and romance to create a memorable story about the dangers and complications that occur when you wish on a star -- and your dreams come true. Former astrophysics graduate student and apartment-building manager, Cal, scans the night skies for a discovery that will help him regain his position in the scientific community. His only tenant, Leslie, is newly divorced, out of work, and at the end of her rope. One night they both witness -- and are nearly incinerated by -- what appears to be a crashing UFO. When a mysterious stranger, an unscrupulous UFO investigator, and a wily sheriff arrive, Cal and Leslies lives are turned upside down.
