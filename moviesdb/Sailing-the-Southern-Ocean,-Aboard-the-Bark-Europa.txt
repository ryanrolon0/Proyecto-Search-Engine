Sailing the Southern Ocean, Aboard the Bark Europa

 On February 21, 2009, the Bark Europa sailed on a seven week adventure across the Southern Ocean--beginning in Ushuaia, Argentina (the southern most city on planet earth), across the stormy high seas of the Drake Passage, into the frigid, iceberg filled Antarctic waters of the Weddell Sea, toward the King Penguin and Fur Seal filled bays of South Georgia Island and Tristan da Cunha (the most remote inhabited island on earth), finally arriving in Cape Town, South Africa, 53 days later. Stunning scenery, incredible wildlife encounters and interesting commentary along this 5600 mile route, create a very entertaining experience.
