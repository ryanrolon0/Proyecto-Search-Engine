Thick Lips Thin Lips

 Without dialogue and set to the mesmerizing soundtrack by Lebanese-Canadian classical pianist Linda Shumas and Chinese-Canadian jazz pianist Lee Pui Ming, the film shows two men - one Asian with a small mouth and thin lips, the other Afro-Caribbean with a large mouth and thick lips, trying to overcome differences and difficulties in their attempt to kiss each other, only to have their efforts (and the beautiful music) repeatedly thwarted by the sound of shattered glass and strangers heckling racist and homophobic remarks. The film ends with a passionate kiss and a smile on the faces of these two men, as they have overcome their initial difficulties and have learnt to accept and to enjoy each other's differences.
