The Light of Western Stars

 Easterner Madeline Hammond buys a ranch not knowing Hayworth is using it to smuggle ammunition across the border. When trouble starts, she brings back Gene Hammond, the ex-foreman who left the country after fighting with the Sheriff. Gene learns of Hayworth's scheme and forces him to blow up his supply. But the Sheriff, not getting his cut, has Hayworth killed and then arrives to arrest Gene for the murder.
