The Impossible Possum

 Barney walks out of his cabin singing, "I've gonna have possum for dinner!" He notices a nearby possum and thinks his dinner plan is set. However, this possum is smarter than Barney figured (he has a heck of a time trying to remove his tail from a branch). Barney figures he can outsmart the possum using a female possum hand puppet which the possum falls for. Barney plays jitterbug music and they dance. Alas, the disguise comes off when the possum invites the girl home with him. Finally, Barney chops down the possum's tree home... only to have it crash land on his house. Oh well, Barney just says, "I told ya I was gonna have possum for dinner and there he is," pointing to the possum chowing down at his dinner table.
