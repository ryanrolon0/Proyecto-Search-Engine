The Third World

 Introduces the concept of "The Third World". It discusses the differences between the Socialist bloc, the Free-Trade (Capitalist) bloc, and the less developed 3rd World nations. Most were colonies of "First World" nations, and most still have some ties with their x-rulers. We examine the daily life, economy, problems, and future possibilities for the people of these nations.
