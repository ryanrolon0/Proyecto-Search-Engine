Umi's Heart

 Umis Heart is the story of two brothers, having to broach the sometime difficult subject of religious conversion. Adam and Ezra are thrust into a theological joust, upon Adam refusing to eat a pepperoni pizza, which he did not order. Ezra insists that he just pick it off, and this spills over into a much deeper discussion of Adam's newly adopted religious beliefs. As their debate stumbles through the ideological differences of their faiths, Adam attempts to find common ground in the memory of their Mother (Umi in Arabic).
