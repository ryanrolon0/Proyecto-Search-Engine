Shipwreck

 Evey year, around 700 old big ships from developed countries sail across the sea, looking for a cheap place in a developing country -call it India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, Turkey or others- where to run aground. Shipwreck is a documentary that speaks about this enormous industry, that is bases on brutal recycling and that certainly has deep environmental, economic and social repercussions.
