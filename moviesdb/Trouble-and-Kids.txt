Trouble and Kids

 Jenna (8) and Tommy (8) are surprised when a creature tunnels up from underground and appears in their very own backyard. It has never been "up above" before and is curious about this new world. However, the creature's curiosity draws it into several potentially dangerous situations. Jenna and Tommy become its guardians and watch over him. The movie encourages toddlers to learn about safety through visually descriptive scenes interlaced with comedy, song and animation.
