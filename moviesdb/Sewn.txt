Sewn

 A dark alternative fairytale, Sewn follows the spirited Amber as she is sold to the Keeper of a surreptitious shop, which deals in wools and garments infused with black magic. Amber quickly learns that behind the Keeper's polite demeanour hides a much darker, oppressive man. She learns this lesson through an unthinkable act of cruelty. Sharing her new affliction with her two co-workers - a wise blind man and a timid deaf girl - Amber starts to take note of the strange inconsistencies in the world around her. Gradually, she unravels the truth behind the magic. Inspired both narratively and visually by the alternate worlds of Edward Scissorhands and Perfume, Sewn attempts to subtly comment on real world issues of censorship and deception.
