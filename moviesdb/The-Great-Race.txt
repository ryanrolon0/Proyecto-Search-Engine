The Great Race

 The Great Race is a genuine sprint race over 50 metres between a man 'Marty' and his one eyed cat called Midge. No one has ever seen a cat who races a human but Midge races Marty all the time and is determined to win. In the film there is Chris Slack as the commentator and John Crowther as 'Big John' the referee.
