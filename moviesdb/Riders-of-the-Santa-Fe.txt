Riders of the Santa Fe

 Tom Benner controls the town and the water supply. When his stooge Mayor rebels, he has him killed and replaced with Bullseye Johnson who immediately brings in Matt Canway as the town Marshal. Conway doesn't carry a gun but he is soon on to Benner and out to prove that Benner has altered the survey lines to obtain the water rights.
