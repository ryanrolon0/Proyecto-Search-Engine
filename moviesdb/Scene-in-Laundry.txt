Scene in Laundry

 Three women are seen washing clothes, the man attendants bringing in boilers of water. One of the men gets "gay" with the women and they sprinkle him with water. Finally he is pushed into one of the tubs and they splash the water all over him, and then to cap the climax they take another tub of water and pour it over his head. He has all he can do to get away. This film will amuse your audience from start to finish.
