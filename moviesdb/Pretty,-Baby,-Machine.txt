Pretty, Baby, Machine

 PBM explores a pocket in time during the long, hot summer of 1933 provides the backdrop for a story that easily could have been. Prohibition is in full swing and Capone is king. Joseph Kennedy is building his empire, and John Dillinger is in jail. Three of the worlds most infamous gangsters, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and Machine Gun Kelly, each have a weak spot, someone -apparently Capone - has found each gangster's Achilles. The trio, make an uneasy pact to put their common foe in the dirt.But the difference between what PBM are led to believe and the truth is wide.
