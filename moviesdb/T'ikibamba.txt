T'ikibamba

 T'ikibamba is a documentary film that explores the growing trend of 'voluntourism' and the impact it has on developing countries. The crew follows the journey of 12 Canadian university students on a mission to 'save lives in Peru' following floods that devastated the Sacred Valley. The students discover that development doesn't happen in only two weeks and that 'voluntourism' can have negative results for local communities. This intimate portrayal of a trip gone wrong enlightens people to the reality of 'development' work and reveals the variety of reasons that compel these students to volunteer abroad. The cameras were rolling for 24 hours a day and captured the moments most volunteers don't tell their families about when they return home.
