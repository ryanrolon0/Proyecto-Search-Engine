The Return of Sam McCloud

 Ex-Marshal McCloud now is senator of New Mexico, fighting for a new environment law. His enemy is Maitland, unscrupulous owner of Chemtel, the world's most important chemical manufacturer. Shortly after McCloud gives an inspiring speech, he barely escapes an bomb in his car and a shooting in a restaurant. When he learns that his niece, medical researcher for Chemtel, was killed, he begins to suspect that the attempts on his life were not made by Arabian terrorists, but by Maitland. He pays him a visit in Britain and starts to research on his own.
