The Figure of Authority

 An overweight aspiring police officer who lives a dull, tightly controlled life has been told he must lose some weight and get into better shape before he will be able to become an officer. In the meantime he takes up a post working for a quirky private investigator. While investigating one particular case, the man realizes he may be closer to police work than most of the active force.
