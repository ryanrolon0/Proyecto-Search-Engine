Spike, the Bag-Punching Dog

 "This active little animal has made a great hit wherever he has appeared on the vaudeville stage. A large bag is suspended by a cord so that it is just out of reach of his nose. The dog jumps for it and having once set it in motion pursues it with utmost vigor, bumping it with his snout whenever it comes within reach."
