Sista dagen

 Passing by is as much a static existential drama as an absurd black comedy. Tobias has at his graduation day gone astray. At an allotment garden he meets Mona, who is in the process of burying some people in an hole. Tobias and Mona develops a relationship that includes tenderness as well as melancholic madness.
