Rocket Singh

 Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) has just graduated, and his marks are, well, let's say a little embarrassing. But marks never stopped him from dreaming of an exciting and adventurous career, and they never will. 'Rocket Singh - Salesman of the Year' is the sometimes thoughtless, sometimes thoughtful story of a fresh graduate trying to find a balance between the maddening demands of the 'professional' way, and the way of his heart - and stumbling upon a crazy way which turned his world upside down, and his career right side up. Welcome to the world of sales, boss! After obtaining just 38.72% from Mumbai University, Harpreet Singh Bedi, who lives with his grandfather, gets employed with AYS Computers as a Salesman. This is where he will find out that honesty is NOT the best policy; will be treated as a 'Joker Sardar'; be shunned and mocked by his superiors and colleagues alike. His overtures to make a name for himself will compel him to partner with four other employees from the firm, namely Girish Reddy, Koena Shaikh, Chhotelal Mishra, and Nitin Rathore, leading to the creation of a fictitious organization - 'Rocket Sales Corporation'.
