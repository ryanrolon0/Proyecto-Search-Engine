Seed of a Thought

 Pearl is isolated from the outside world; purposely insulated in her cocoon of romance novels and an enclosed garden. One afternoon while weeding in her backyard she unearths a large seed. Curious as to what it will become, she gives it a place to grow in her kitchen. Late that night, she awakens to a strange noise. When she discovers that a creature has hatched from her seed, she is at first frightened then enamored by its affectionate nature. Pearl and her new pet become friends - even better friends when the creature reveals its ability to transport her into her romantic fantasies. A few days later, the creature is dying and Pearl tries everything to bring him back to life. Nothing works until a disgruntled salesman pushes his way into her home. Finally the creature's gruesome appetite is revealed. Pearl must now decide how much of her humanity she is willing to trade to maintain her imaginary life.
