The Life and Times of Çetin Altan

 The documentary tells the story of Cetin Altan, one of Turkey's most prolific and well known writers and journalists. Throughout the geopolitical clashings of the Cold War, Altan defended the right to publish, enduring great pressure and emerging as a sharp observer of broader human trends. Introducing America's post WW II strategic involvements to an audience without prior knowledge of the region, the documentary links significant historical events with Altan's own rise as an author.
