Red-Headed Baby

 The old toymaker goes to sleep, and his toys immediately come to life and sing "Red-Headed Baby." A red-haired baby doll begins the song. She's soon joined by her sweetheart, a toy soldier named Napoleon. A spider briefly spoils the fun when he descends upon the toys and grabs the doll. It's up to Napoleon to save her.
