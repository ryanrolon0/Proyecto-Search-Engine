Theros

 'Theros' (harvesting in ancient Greek) A short computer animated film which criticizes an issue of the modern human society. It is a non-narrative character based piece, which through the use of strong imagery and repetitive animation delivers the message. The overall look is non-realistic with abstract forms and loose representations of a plausible reality.
