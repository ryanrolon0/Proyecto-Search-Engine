The Autobiography of a 'Jeep'

 A jeep explains how it came to be invented, and the tasks that it is used for. When the United States went to war, its motorized divisions needed a new kind of vehicle, the jeep, which was designed by the automobile industry. After vigorous tests, the new vehicle has now proved useful and reliable. Designed to do everything from crossing rivers to towing artillery, the jeep is in use everyplace that the Army goes.
