Velvet and Rat Skins

 Exis lives in an upper class world on the top of a sky scraper. A feral boy named Jak lives far below in primitive squalor. When Jak finds a way up into the upper world, the two meet and they are the answer to each others longing. But Dr Killdergarten would rather see Jak on his dissecting table than fraternizing with his child.
