Sea Salt

 A young writer sinks slowly into depression and isolation as the story he writes uncovers the unhealed scars of his past. In his loneliness he takes up a friendship with a stuffed gorilla (a key to his past), and is dared to look at the world differently when an attractive off-beat girl comes into his life... Sometimes though, even healing hurts a little bit.
