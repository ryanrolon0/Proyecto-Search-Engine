Telepathy

 Josef and Viktor Zalenski are identical twin brothers who are chosen by the Russian government as the subjects of a top-secret experiment to test the powers of telepathy as a form of communication between Earth and outer space. While Josef is wired up to complex technology on a remote military base, his brother is launched into space in order to test their powers of telepathy. Forced into intimate and prolonged contact after years of estrangement, the twins become mentally and emotionally closer until Josef discovers by means of intuition a secret that his brother has kept hidden for many years.
