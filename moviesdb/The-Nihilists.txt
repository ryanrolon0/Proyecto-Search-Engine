The Nihilists

 As a family is enjoying dinner together, the elderly father is suddenly arrested as a political offender. Tsarist officers imprison him and treat him brutally. With his family's appeals refused, he is sent to Siberia, and dies on the difficult journey. Three of his family members then join the Nihilists, swearing to gain vengeance regardless of the risk or cost.
