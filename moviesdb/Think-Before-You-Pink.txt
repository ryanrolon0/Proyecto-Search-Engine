Think Before You Pink

 A pedestrian Pink Panther cannot complete his crossing of a busy city road before his "Walk" light changes to, "Don't walk." He must return to his original side of the intersection, and every subsequent attempt to walk across the road is equally unsuccessful. A little man at a pedestrians' club advises the panther to try crossing the road by other means vaulting, attaching a rocket to his back, walking across an electric wire, being a "human" cannonball, and building a wooden suspension bridge. Each effort fails painfully for the hapless panther. He finally disguises himself as a mother tabby with a litter of kittens and is permitted to fully cross the road - but a falling piano lands on him.
