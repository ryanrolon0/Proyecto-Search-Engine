Titanic Town

 Set in Belfast in 1972, the politically naïve Bernie is trying to bring up a normal family in less than normal surroundings. Her best friend is accidentally shot dead by the IRA, and her neighbours are constantly raided by the army. In this climate of fear and confusion, she dares to stand up and condemn the killings. Criticising both factions equally, her public call for a ceasefire is interpreted by many as an attack against the IRA, and as her fledgling peace movement takes momentum, she and her family are placed in the frontline.
