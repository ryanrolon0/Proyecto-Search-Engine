Romantic Youth

 French ballerina Collette Marchand, from Roland Petit's "Ballet de Paris" and 1954's "Moulin Rouge", starred in and choreographed this 1954 impressionistic short in which a lonely shop clerk (Milorad Miskovitch) dreams that the dummy he is dressing comes to life. She is first Romance, who eludes him; then Desire, who tires of him; and Youth, who leaves him. He awakens to find that the little shop girl (Collette Marchand) he works with is the embodiment of all his dreams.
