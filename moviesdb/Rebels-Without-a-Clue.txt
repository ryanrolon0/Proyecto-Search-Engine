Rebels Without a Clue

 Damian and Mark, two bored 16-year-olds, long to escape their tiny forgotten village high on the Northern moors of England. They spend their time idly taking pot-shots at sheep and passing cars with Damian's air rifle. But everything changes when they covertly witness a large thug and a businessman meeting in a deserted lay-by to exchange drugs and money. The boys unwittingly cause the drug deal to go horribly wrong, and the thug kills his cocaine-dealing "business associate". When the thug flees the scene, Damian and Mark seize the opportunity to steal the drug dealer's classic American Cadillac, together with his gun, a sackful of cash and a kilo of of cocaine. Now all they have to do is buy a spade to bury the drug dealer's body (stashed in the trunk), appease Damian's mouthy girlfriend, lose their virginity, get off the moors, and head South to Spain. Easier said than done when the killer's in pursuit and you're...Rebels Without a Clue. Two teenage boys witness a drugs deal go horribly wrong on the moors of England.
