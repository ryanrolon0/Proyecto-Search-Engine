Stand and Deliver

 With the looming health care crisis facing the City of Los Angeles and the country as a whole, the Stand and Deliver program was created to attract a previously untapped pipeline of young out-of-work, out-of school minority, disadvantaged youth ages 18 to 24 to health care careers. The documentary is an up close and personal look at the program through the eyes of the students, mentors, hospital staff and city officials. Each student was given a camera and asked to tell their story and how this opportunity has impacted their lives and their futures.
