The Tired Tailor's Dream

 A weary tailor is just about to take a rest when a customer enters his shop. The man quickly becomes impatient with the slow-moving tailor, and threatens him with a gun, demanding that he make a suit quickly. The man then leaves, indicating that he will be back soon. Terrified but still exhausted, the tailor wishes there were an easier way to get the suit made.
