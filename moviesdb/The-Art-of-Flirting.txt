The Art of Flirting

 The film follows Story Hero as he goes out attempting to flirt with girls instructed by a voiceover. Shot as a black and white silent comedy, TAoF is an instructional guide showing us how to flirt. TAoF is contemporary but uses the silent movie style to emphasise flirting as primarily non-verbal and to demonstrate flirting is a classic and somewhat neglected art. TAoF is also a homage to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton.
