The Story

 Every person's life is their story, told at their own pace and from their own perspective. It's impossible for them to truly see their own life from anyone else's point of view, simply because it isn't theirs to have. As such, the actions of others are frequently a mystery to any individual because they cannot see the motivation that generates them. 'THE STORY' tells the tale of such an individual - The Wanabee, a man determined to impress his boss by murdering one of his competitors, a mysterious business mind simply known as The Man. He sets out on this unlikely sojourn with information provided by an eccentric, seemingly omniscient bar-dweller called The Storyteller. The Wanabee does not heed his warning, and heads out. Along the way, a series of strange and inexplicable events take hold of him, all in one day. The audience is taken on his journey of confusion from its foreboding inception to its abrupt halt - and then the day starts over.
