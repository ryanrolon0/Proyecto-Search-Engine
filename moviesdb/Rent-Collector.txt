Rent Collector

 In the rear of an old-fashioned English house, two burly blacksmiths are engaged in removing the grime of their day's toil. They are washing in a large tub of water, and "the muscles of the brawny arms stand out like iron bands." One is evidently in a boisterous mood and amuses himself by ducking his partner's head in the tub. The victim, enraged by this treatment, lifts up the entire tub of water and dashes it at his tormentor. Just at this moment the rent collector, immaculately dressed, and topped off with a silk hat of the latest style, emerges through the back door and receives the entire contents of the tub over his person. No one seems to care but the rent collector, and it is a lucky thing that moving pictures do not record speech as well as motion.
