The Path to Redemption

 From pre-production to release, we are given an exclusive look into the making of Ridley Scott's _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_(qv). Interviews with the cast and crew members take up the bulk of this film, but are accompanied by plenty of on-set footage. We are also given a glimpse at a lot of the deleted material, much of which will be in the director's cut.
