The Earl of Sandwich

 Abandoned at birth, raised by royalty and prophesied to bring greatness to the world, Sir John Montague lived a life of high expectations. As years passed he became Earl of the great land of Sandwich and administrator of the Royal Navy. Despite all his wealth and power, the Earl was still dissatisfied. It was not until a terrifying vision came to him in a dream, that his true purpose was realized. The Earl would become the first to put meat between two slices of bread, hence the sandwich was born. But 18th century England was not ready to embrace such a bold concept and quickly condemned the Earl's immoral lifestyle. Rejected by society and forced into seclusion, the Earl's growing obsession brings him to the brink of madness. Clouding his judgment, he neglects to fulfill his military obligations, setting off a catastrophic chain of events that will change history forever.
