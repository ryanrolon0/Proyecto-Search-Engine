The Dark Avengers

 Bryan Yuen Sage has spent the last two years of his life among criminals as a vigilante that has become something of an urban legend. While fearing he's on his last bit of humanity, his former best friend, Kevin Matthew Smith, experiences a similar tragedy - the murder of a significant other. Soon Kevin is on the same dark path as his friend, who he believed dead.
