Suburban Handicap, 1897

 "The Suburban is run at Sheepshead Bay track, Coney Island. Several views of the great race are given. The parade to the post, the start, the finish showing Ben Brush winning, Simms up, with the others strung out, tearing down the stretch in the dust, under whip and spur. Then the weighing out, jockeys saluting, dismounting, and un-saddling."
