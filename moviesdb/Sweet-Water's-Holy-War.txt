Sweet Water's Holy War

 In 2000 Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutional Persons Act (RLUIPA) and since then there have been hundreds of RLUIPA cases brought against communities across America. Lawmakers promised a review of the law after ten years. Ten years have gone and so have the authors of the statute and with them the promise of a Congressional Review. This programme considers the evidence from both sides of this controversial legislation to determine if RLUPA has achieved what its authors intended and the consequences they did not foresee. NB - The submission is not a finished film but will be completed by early April 2011.
