SzüzijátEk

 Two young adults (Anna and Egon) are near the end of their twenties when they come to realize that the blond princes and princesses that they've been waiting for must have either lost their way or their white horses. Anna discovers the female inside her and she persuades sleepy-head Egon to start a competition aimed at finding the real one. However this racetrack is unknown territory to both of them, so they quickly find themselves in a series of absurd and funny events.
