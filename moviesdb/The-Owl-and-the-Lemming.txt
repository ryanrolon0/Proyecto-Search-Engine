The Owl and the Lemming

 The owl and the lemming in this animated film are short-legged, plumply stuffed puppets made of seal-skin by Inuit artists. The accompanying song and voices are in Inuktitut, although the legend is narrated in English. It preserves on film an example of Inuit folklore that may in time disappear.
