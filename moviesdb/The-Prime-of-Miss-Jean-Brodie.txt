The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie

 A liberated young schoolteacher at an Edinburgh girls' school in the period between the two wars, instructs her girls on the ways of life. Ignoring the more mundane subjects, she teaches them of love, politics and art. Her affairs with two male teachers become known and she finds herself fighting to keep her job. She believes that she can always count on the 100% support of her favourite pupils, but one of them does not feel that Miss Jean Brodie is in her "prime" any more. No longer swayed by her teacher's eloquence, she begins to learn about life and love herself. Miss Jean Brodie is the slightly eccentric teacher at a Scottish girls school. She wants "her gels" to follow their hearts desire. Some adore her, some hate her, but none of them can ignore her.
