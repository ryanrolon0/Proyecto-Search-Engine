The Breakfast Parliament

 In the empty mess hall of Ein Tzurim Kibbutz, a number of the kibbutz's veterans gather every morning. In a place where everything has been privatized, they run a parliament that seriously discusses matters of inner politics, gossip, agriculture and the kibbutz's 60th anniversary. When the secretariat and the kibbutz committee decide to stop the breakfasts, parliament members begin an uncompromising struggle to preserve the last pillar of kibbutz life they have left.
