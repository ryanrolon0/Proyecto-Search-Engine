The Vigilantes Ride

 Utilizing a plot that Columbia had used twice before with Buck Jones and again with Charles Starrett, this version shifts the state of the Rangers from Texas to Arizona, where Ranger Rod Saunders is killed by a band of outlaws and his brother Ranger Lucky Saunders swears to avenge his death. The outlaws, led secretly by town businessman Anse Rankin, have been terrorizing the town and the citizens. Rankin accuses the Rangers of being unable to cope with the situation and organizes a Vigilante Defense League, with himself as the head and with the intent of forcing the ranchers to pay tribute for protection against his own gang. Lucky, working with Captain Randall, resigns in disgrace from the Rangers and pretends to go over to the side of the outlaws. When Rangers Lucky and his brother chase outlaws, the brother is killed. To find the killer Lucky quits the Rangers and robs the bank. This gets him into the outlaw gang where he learns of their next raid. Sneaking out at night he tells his girl friend who must now convince the Sheriff that Lucky is not an outlaw and that he must sent his men out to catch the gang.
