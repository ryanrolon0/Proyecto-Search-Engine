 This musical movie was ready to be filmed. To save some of the budget, the casting director, Senior Tsai, picked up his roles from the rejects of an audition. These include a kid from Hong Kong, who can both write and sing, Candy, a girl who's just like a Barbie doll, and LaReine, a snappy girl who can dance hip-pop to the top, together they co-starred this new title. Tsai he called upon Johnny, who used to be the hottest idol, to helm the musical and train the new hopefuls. Progressively, the shooting got started and Johnny, the 'has-been' idol, eagerly hoped it would win him his come-back moment. Then, he met his old lover, Mable, who encouraged Johnny to cherish this precious opportunity. Highly competitive and conceited LaReine, had a strong desire to give her best shot, but got reprimanded frequently by Johnny. New up and coming artist Jack, a pretentious and upper class person, was promoted by the financier of the film. Striving for the best dancing performance, Johnny called for the help of his past crew, Tiger who's now a professional and exclusive choreographer of some big stars, and asked him to work on the choreographing and dancer's training. Gradually, under Tiger's regimented requests, everybody reached the standards required at the professional level.
