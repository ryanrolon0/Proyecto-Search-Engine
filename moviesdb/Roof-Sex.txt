Roof Sex

 Did Lord Chesterfield and Queen Anne carry on like this? It's the classic apartment-house roof top everywhere, and a door to a stairwell. As the door flies open, the laughter of a man and woman at play accompanies the appearance of two stop-animated chairs - he chasing her. They mate, enthusiastically, across the roof top, changing positions, her elbows chaffing against the brick and rough edges. Later that day, their owner enters the flat and sees stuffing sticking out from tears in the upholstery of the "female" chair. Someone has to pay.
