Tortoise

 Teenage brothers, Charlie and Billy, have an especially close bond, compensating in their own way for a childhood spent growing up in the shadow of a monolithic oil refinery and an emotionally unstable and brutal father. Charlie has been trying to persuade his younger brother Billy, to leave their remote home for over a year with little success. In doing so, he has sacrificed any chance of a better life for himself in order to wait for his brother. Billy, younger and emotionally fragile, is reluctant to let go of his childhood home, until yet another violent incident finally tips the balance; enabling him to make the decision his older brother has been waiting for. The brothers finally escape their remote and decaying home, without anything but each other and a little hope. The short film Tortoise is a brutal, reflective drama played out on some less trodden and windswept shore of England. Sometimes home is the last place you need to be.
