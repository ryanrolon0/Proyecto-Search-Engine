The Wooing of Wathena

 John Menton, with his wife and baby daughter, settled in the Great West. Red-Leaf, an old Indian squaw, lost her child around that time and kidnapped the pretty baby daughter. Years passed. The baby grew tall and beautiful and was called Wathena. One day John Menton came again to the big West, this time to superintend the construction of a railway. His surveyor, Will Beverly, stopped work that day to take a snap-shot of a young Indian miss. He developed it, and fell in love with the image. He showed it to Menton, who immediately went in search of her, identifying her as his daughter. And there was happiness untold in the construction camp that night.
