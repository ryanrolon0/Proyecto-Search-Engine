They Found the Leak

 This is a very funny episode of the amateur plumber. Two men descend into a dark cellar with a lighted candle, searching for a leak in the gas main. When they find it, there is a terrific explosion, and out of the debris appear two men in a most dilapidated condition. The effects in this picture are excellently worked out.
