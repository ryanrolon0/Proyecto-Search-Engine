Tintin et le temple du soleil

 When seven archaeologists find an old Inca temple, they become the victims of an old Inca curse. Back in Europe, one by one they fall into a deep sleep and only once a day, all at the same time, they wake up for some minutes and have hallucinations of the Inca god. The story begins with the 6th archaeologist being put into sleep by the contents of a crystal ball that are thrown into his car by Indios. The last conscious archaeologist stays at Tintin and Haddock in Moulinsart. A thunderstorm approaches and the lights go out. This is used by the Indios to put the last one in sleep and to capture professor Tournesol, who has proved to be a desecrater of the sanctuary by putting on the bracelet of the Inca god. His friends Tintin and Haddock follow the track to Peru, up to the mountains through snow and jungle and finally discover the temple of the sun wheres they are captured, too. Their only choice is to chose the day on which they want to be burned to death by the sun. Tintin chooses wisely and is able use the a solar eclipse. At the end he achieves forgiveness and the archaeologists are cured from their curse and Tournesol is freed.
