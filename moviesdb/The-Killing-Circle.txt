The Killing Circle

 A woman who lives alone in an isolated forest house witnesses a murder. A policeman arrives quickly after her desperate call. The rational thread of investigation eventually breaks, throwing them into an inconceivable nightmare. it is an independent film production in HD video. It has been realized as a preliminary experimental and art-research project for my PhD research in media. There is no company involved in the production. The film is non commercial and it will be released under Creative Commons License later on.
