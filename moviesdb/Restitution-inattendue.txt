Restitution inattendue

 Man enters restaurant and sits at table. Waiter takes his order, and departs to have the meal prepared. He returns with the soup and other eatables. After placing the second course of the meal on a table in an adjoining room, he proceeds to serve the soup. While the waiter is taking the customer's order for dessert, a huge dog enters the room where the second course was placed on the table, and upon seeing the meal, helps himself. The waiter upon returning to the room for the second course, is surprised to see part of it on the floor. The dog again appears, and the waiter, knowing that he is the culprit, commands him to "cough up," which he does. Here we see the dog giving back what he has eaten, piece by piece. When the waiter gets all the dog has eaten, he proceeds to pick up the remainder from the floor. The customer now has a job on his hands. When he attempts to cut the meat, he finds the knife is dull, or the meat is tough. The facial expressions on both waiter and customer are very funny, and the picture ends by the customer giving up in disgust.
