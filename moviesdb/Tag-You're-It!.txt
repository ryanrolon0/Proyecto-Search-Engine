Tag You're It!

 Jake and Jenna are playing tag in the woods, scaring each other, when a clown creeps up from behind. The spoiler coming home from a long day at the carnival! He calls them in for dinner in "15" and the kids go on to play one more round of tag before calling it a day. Fast paced and fun! Written and directed by 9-year old Emma Kenney.
