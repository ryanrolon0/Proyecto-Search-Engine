So You Want to Be a V.P.

 Joe McDoakes is employed as the seventh vice-president in a firm that only makes promotions from the employee ranks. The sixth vice-president tries to tutor Joe in how to get ahead with the boss, but all his ideas backfire. Thrity years later, Joe is the only vice-president left to be promoted but, just as the prized promotion is about to be bestowed, the Boss, as usual, forgets Joe's name...and so does Joe.
