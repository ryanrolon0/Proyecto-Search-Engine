Return of the Jackalope

 In 1995, brothers Jimmy Ray Johnson and Bobby Ray Johnson collaborated to produce the horror movie "Curse of the Jackalope." The film was purchased at the Lula (GA) International Film Festival and Barbeque Cook-Off by producer Richard McCovey and released into theaters by his company, McCovey Pictures. Amid bad reviews and a disastrous distribution, the film grossed a total of $17 at the box office. Over time, the film has gained a hint of notoriety as the "lowest grossing film of all time." Richard McCovey Jr has taken over his father's company, with grand plans of re-releasing the film. But first, he has to reunite the cast & crew for the ten-year Anniversary screening, an event he's dubbed "Jackalope X."
