The Wounded

 Los Angeles, the city of angels where six murders a day occur... A group of troubled youths learn survival skills from Taka, a prison counselor. Their rite of passage is tested when Taka takes these natural enemies on a forest retreat where they encounter a cult of death and its most unusual member, Bella, the psychopathic beauty who feasts on unsuspecting hikers. Taka is captured along with some of his students. Adversaries are now forced to depend on each other to survive. The hunt is on between the cult of death and the Wounded.
