The Incredible Stranger

 In turn of the century Bridgewood, a mysterious stranger from Chicago requests, by letter to the local contractor, that a four bedroom house be built in town. The stranger moves into the house by himself without saying a word to any of the townsfolk. He lives there seemingly alone, but orders through the local store clothing, including that for a woman and two children. But no one knows what is happening in the house as the stranger never says anything to anyone, and no one else ever goes in or out of the house. The entire town eventually learns why the man moved to Bridgewood and why he doesn't speak. But it's the secret kept behind the locked doors of his house that tells the full heartbreaking story.
