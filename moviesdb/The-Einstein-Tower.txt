 The year is 2013. Suicide is out of control, even for New Tokyo City. A young man's been told his ex-girlfriend has added herself to the list of victims. He returns to the city to find out why. His past is filled with mistakes and jobs undone. But this time he will finish what he starts. Even if it kills him.
