 Dinesh Khanna, his wife, Lata, and their son, Pappu, lead a harmonious and happy upper-middle class life in Bombay, India. Despite of their happiness, they know that Lata's heart is weak, and unable to withstand shock or over-excitement. While on a outing, Pappu starts having health problems, and must be admitted in hospital, so that various tests can be carried out to isolate and treat the problem. A few days later, Dinesh is at work, and the phone rings in the Khanna household. Lata answers the phone, and what she is told the shocking truth - a truth so devastating that it may take her life, and change the lives of her husband and child forever.
