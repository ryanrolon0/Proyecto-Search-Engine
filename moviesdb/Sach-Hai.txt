Sach Hai

 A melodrama set in the holy city of Benares exploiting issues of caste status. Chandan is the son of Kashipati, the head of an influential brahminical sect. His hedonistic brother Shripati wants to get his hands on the sect's assets while the evil Guru - who publicly opposes Chandan's rebellions against traditional casteism - wants to abduct the poor Mangala, daughter of a blind traveler. Chandan's declared love for Roopa, an Untouchable woman, causes major consternation. Adding to the drama is a scene of the flooding river, perceived as a kind of divine judgment for all the misdeeds in the name of religion.
