St. Jacques

 A love story dealing with the theme of death. The characters are yearning for the moments they once lived in their life but the remains of those moments have passed along into their memory bank. They are stuck in this limbo between life and death - this hyper reality of memories is the only thing they have in common. The ocean is the third character of the film. The ocean represents the memory itself constantly shifting back and forth in a dreamlike quality. Each moment of these characters lives are magnified through each others point of view, every action, every reaction, every word, every caress, every gesture has it's own individual purpose but together they find meaning.
