The Hat Lady

 "The Hat Lady" is the inspiring and heart-warming true story of Shirley Eberhardt, whose knitting charity has touched people the world over. Ms. Eberhardt knits caps for newly diagnosed patients - men, women and children - who have no idea they are about to receive a gift from an anonymous stranger. Though struggling with her own disability the Hat Lady "sees" what people need - before they see it themselves. Ultimately, the film reveals the "threads" that connect us to one another.
