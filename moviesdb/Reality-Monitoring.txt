 Woken up one morning and immediately accused of murdering his younger brother, Emmett (Ethan Spickler) makes a run for it and attempts to recall the events of the previous day in order to clear his name - and his conscience. Followed closely by Detective Chase McCloud (Samuel Doll), he is tracked down and confronted and forced to decide if what he remembers is what actually happened - or if he made it up in his head. Also starring Luke Brletich as Cary.
