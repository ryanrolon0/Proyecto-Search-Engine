The Fire Plug

 Scrappy is playing with the old gray mare who was the town's fire horse until being replaced when the town's fire department purchased a modern motorized fire truck. But when the fire alarm sounds, the old mare responds, and with Scrappy steering the discarded truck, they dash to the fire along with the fire chief in his new truck. But the new truck breaks down, and the fire chief admits that the old gray mare is a s good as she used to be.
