The New Spirit

 This short was made expressly for and under the auspices of War Activities Committee of the U. S. Treasury Department, and was distributed to theatres at no charge by only National Screen Services, since the War Activities Committee nor the U. S. Treasury Department had no film-exchange offices nor a theatre-distribution set-up. The premise is that it would take 'taxes to beat the axis', and Donald Duck is a reluctant tax-payer until he listens to a radio broadcast concerning the importance of all U.S. citizens to pay their share of taxes, and Donald gets into a conversation with the radio commentator, and learns why it is important to pay taxes to beat the axis. Flush with the new patriotic spirit of the day, Donald Duck is eager to learn what he can contribute for the war effort. However, that enthusiasm deflates when a radio announcer advises him to pay his income tax promptly. The announcer turns him around by explaining the vital need for his money and he guides Donald through the simplified tax form to help him use his "Taxes to beat the Axis."
