Tug-o-War on Board an Ocean Steamer

 This picture shows a tug-o-war between the male and female passengers of the S.S. New York of the American Line. It was taken during a trip from Southampton to New York on July 28th, 1900. After hard tugging the female passengers are seen to pull the male passengers half the length of the ship. A very exciting picture.
