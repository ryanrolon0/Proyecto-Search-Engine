Requiem für etwas, das sehr klein ist

 The bourgeois couple Esther and Michael have got themselves caught up in a seemingly ironic game of power, provocation and sexuality. Esther is already on the brink of madness when a young artist arrives. Requiem for something which is very small is a psychological horror-drama, with a cultural-political morale, and musical interludes.
