The Coffee Break

 The Coffee Break is the only film of its kind, shattering the illusions about relationships between man and the modern American woman. Racist? Sexist? Offensive? Yes, but only as much as the truth will allow for. Women will hate it, while men will silently reflect on the lessons, and possibly despair.
