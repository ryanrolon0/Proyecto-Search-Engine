The Chicken Thief

 This is a funny one. A fellow steals some chickens and runs away with them, closely followed by the farmer's dog. Just as he is about to escape he trips and falls, dropping the chickens, who return to their roost. He rises and attempts to climb a tree, but is caught by the dog, who proceeds to chew the seat out of his trousers. The man is partly up the tree with the dog hanging on to him. This picture will always get applause.
