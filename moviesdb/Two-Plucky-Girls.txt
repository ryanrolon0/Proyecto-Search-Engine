Two Plucky Girls

 Joel Bigelow has just sold his crop of corn. As he is unable to go to the bank and deposit it, he leaves it in his house. Unfortunately he receives a telegram that his brother has met with a serious accident, and that he is needed at once. Mrs. Bigelow and he depart at once, leaving the money in charge of their daughter, Mabel. In the course of the day, Mabel's chum, finding her alone in the house, offers to stay with her during the night. Just as they feared, a burglar arrives. In the meantime, Mr. And Mrs. Bigelow find that the telegram was a forgery, so they make all haste back to the house, only to find the girls holding two desperate criminals.
