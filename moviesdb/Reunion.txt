Reunion

 Pastor Kevin Michaels and his wife Alice move to a small town, full of hope and excitement to shepherd a church. When they find the church at the center of town in a state of disarray - having been unoccupied for many years -- they are slightly discouraged. That quickly changes to happiness when the community works together to repair the church in time for the first service planned for Easter Sunday. Despite a setback, Kevin and Alice continue to support one another and their new church family. One chilly afternoon, a woman with car trouble arrives in the church parking lot. Kevin invites the woman inside to wait for family to pick her up. The woman is burdened by the bitter pain and memories of a beloved husband cruelly taken from her long ago. Through her, Kevin realizes his purpose in serving the Lord may have been greater than he ever could have imagined. Reunion is a story of faith, undying love and the triumph of the spirit over seemingly insurmountable odds.
