They Stooge to Conga

 The stooges are repairmen who get a job fixing the doorbell in large house which is the secret headquarters of some Nazi spies. They manage to ruin most of the house while working on the wiring and then subdue the spies and sink an enemy submarine by remote control. While working as door to door handymen, the Stooges are hired for the simple job of repairing a doorbell with predictably disastrous results. Not only do they wreck the house, but they also do damage to the telephone lines in the neighborhood. However, they later find out that the woman who hired them is part of a Nazi/Japanese fifth column group who are in America to perform various acts of sabotage.
