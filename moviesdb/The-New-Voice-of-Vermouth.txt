The New Voice of Vermouth

 Pierre, a struggling actor, is given the opportunity to participate in a reality TV show. A show all about Pierre - Pierre and his family, Pierre and his friends, Pierre and his acquaintances. He jumps at the chance and the first episode is about to go to air. Just one problem though, he hasn't got around to telling his long-time girlfriend Natasha yet. He arranges a mysterious meeting with Natasha to spill the beans. Natasha has a pretty good idea of what Pierre has on his mind, and it involves the third finger on her left hand. However, the meeting does not go as planned for either of them. Pierre and Natasha have to come to terms with the reality of their situation, their relationship, and their individual ambitions. Fame comes with a very high price tag - how much is Pierre willing to pay?
