Raamis

 Rendered to a secret detention center known as a Black Site, Raamis, a young Asian student has everything taken from him. Under Enhanced Interrogation, he loses his grip on reality, whilst his captors become ever more frustrated at their failure to extract a confession. Raamis explores the drama of three very different men. One distressed young man. Two determined interrogators. Three very disturbed individuals.
