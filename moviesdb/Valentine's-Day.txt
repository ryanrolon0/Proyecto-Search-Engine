Valentine's Day

 More than a dozen Angelenos navigate Valentine's Day from early morning until midnight. Three couples awake together, but each relationship will sputter; are any worth saving? A grade-school boy wants flowers for his first true love; two high school seniors plan first-time sex at noon; a TV sports reporter gets the assignment to find romance in LA; a star quarterback contemplates his future; two strangers meet on a plane; grandparents, together for years, face a crisis; and, an "I Hate Valentine's Day" dinner beckons the lonely and the lied to. Can Cupid finish his work by midnight? In Los Angeles on February 14th - Valentines Day - a florist is ready to propose to his girlfriend; a babysitter plans to lose her virginity while her grandparents struggle with their marriage; an elementary school-teacher unknowingly falls in love with a married man; a female army captain befriends a fellow-passenger; the local TV station deputes a Sports Reporter to cover 'Valentines Day'; and the owner of an Indian Restaurant has her hands full with a Punjabi wedding ceremony, and a private 'I Hate Valentine's Day' party.
