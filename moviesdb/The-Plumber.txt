The Plumber

 The Plumber is based on an 1920's cartoon by H.M. Bateman. It tells the story of a plumber called to fix a leak in a ladies house. After being left to his own devices he starts his assault on the leaking tap. The Plumber wrestles with the tap and destroys the whole sink in the process. Realising he is not to be beaten by this leak he attacks the walls and floor onto which it stands. The Plumber is so terrible at his job that he floods the room much to the dismay of the Lady of the House and they both tragically drown together.
