South America V

 From the high Andes Mts., across some of the driest deserts to the Pacific Ocean, lie the nations of Equador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. In this narrow strip, the first settlers, the Amerindians, developed some highly complex civilizations, with organized governments, religions and craft industries. Much of this was destroyed by the European conquistadores, who brought in a new way of life. This film examines this past, as well as the resources and present way of life of the people.
