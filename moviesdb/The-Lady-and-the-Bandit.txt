The Lady and the Bandit

 While escaping from the police, English highwayman Dick Turpin meets Joyce Greene. They marry and Turpin settles down to respectability until his mother-in-law discovers he is the famous outlaw. He resumes his old calling along with Tom King and uncovers evidence that proves his arch-enemy, Lord Willoughby, is plotting against King George. He is betrayed by Cecile, a jealous accomplice, and to protect his wife, Turpin rides the 200 miles from London to York.
