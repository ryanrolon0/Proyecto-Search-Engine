Sailors Don't Cry

 A sailor's bar in a small port town. Hilde works behind the counter and earns just enough to keep herself and her young son. Shortly after the child's birth, his father ran out on her to take up a life of wandering. She finds some comfort with Guy and with her friend Anna. When Paul suddenly returns, old wounds are reopened before the child's very eyes.
