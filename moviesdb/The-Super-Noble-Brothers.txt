The Super Noble Brothers

 Davey, Tommy, and Andy Noble are local celebrities in Milwaukee-ubiquitous scenesters whose diverse projects dot the city's cultural landscape. The outgoing Andy and Tommy's DJ gigs; their almost famous bands-the Pacers and the Thousandaires-and their successful trade in ultra-rare funk and soul records have put them on the map and keep their heads above water. Meanwhile, the younger Davey Noble takes a more difficult path as an abstract painter, blithely braving poverty, hunger, and obscurity rather than get a job. With humor, stunning cinematography and incredible music, filmmaker and artist Mark Escribano presents a stylish and mesmerizing glimpse into the unique subculture inhabited by "The Super Noble Brothers."
