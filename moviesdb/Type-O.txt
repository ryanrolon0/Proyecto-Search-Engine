Type O

 A mother must decide on the course of treatment for her sick daughter. Veronica is left with no real options for her daughter Monique, other than to agree to a potentially fatal surgery or see her child live in pain. Veronica's ex-husband and his new wife criticize her for not immediately consenting to the surgery but Veronica holds out as long as possible as she searches for assurance.
