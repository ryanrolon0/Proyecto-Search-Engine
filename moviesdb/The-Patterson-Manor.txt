The Patterson Manor

 Jake and Emily Patterson move into their new home to find out that not only are the previous owners dead, but they haven't moved out. Now Jake and Emily must figure a way to get rid of their uninvited and undead house guests or learn to live with those who passed away but haven't passed on.
