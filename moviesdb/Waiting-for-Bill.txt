Waiting for Bill

 A girl is walking up and down in the vicinity of a military camp. A private sees her and attempts to pick up an acquaintance. He is supplanted by a Lieutenant, who in turn is obliged to give way to a General. The General thinks he is getting on favorably when Bill the Slugger strolls in, looking for his girl. He sees her with the General, but does not stand on military formalities, for he punches the General and makes off with the girl.
