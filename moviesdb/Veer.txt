Veer

 Circa 1920 British India, Pindari leader, Prithvi Singh, narrates his story to a Report from London Times about betrayal and deceit at the hands of the British and Madhavgarh's Raja Gyanendra Singh which led to the massacre of 4500 Pindaris. Although Prithvi sliced off Gyanendra's right arm, he has sworn to avenge and behead him and two-faced Britishers - who on one hand preach about Justice, Fraternity and Equality, but conquer and rule vulnerable natives - fueling hate and division on lines of religion, and caste. He sends his sons, Veer Pratap and Poonam, to Britain to learn about their devious ways, so that he can conquer Madhavgarh. The duo, despite of Lord Macaulay's malicious policy to convert foreign nationals to his way of thinking, not only pick up the relevant skills but also slay Yuvraj Sujan Singh, the only son of Gyanendra, much to the joy of the Pindaris. But Prithvi is in for a shock when he finds out that Veer has decided to wed Yashodhara, Sujan's sister, little knowing that she, after being crowned Yuvraji, has sworn to eliminate all enemies of Madhavgarh at any and all costs.
