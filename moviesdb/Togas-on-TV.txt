Togas on TV

 This documentary examines how we deal with the Romans in the living room. Are they enemies, or are they the civilizing power of the past? Is it the works of Shakespeare, the running gags of Frankie Howerd, or the mob style family drama made famous by I, Claudius, or something completely different? In interviews with critics, writers, and historians, the role of the Romans is examined in some detail.
