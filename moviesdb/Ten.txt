Ten

 How bad does your day start when you wake up because of that irritating beep of your cell phone? Many people would curse, but did you know cursing is forbidden in the Ten Commandments? A man starts of his day like this. The second he wakes up because his cell phone rings, his first sin can be counted. Watch as it won't be long before his second, third and fourth sin are committed. How long can it take a human to do all things God has explicitly forbidden?
