Uncle Si and the Sirens

 Uncle Si sits at home with his wife reading a pamphlet about the most wonderful and marvelous invention of the age - the American Television Receiver. It can receive the human voice and show the human form. The illustration inspires him to build one. In the bedroom he works with radio parts and what looks like a mirrored vanity. Success! The image of Miss Cynthia Squires, the world famous temperance lecturer, appears in the mirror. Si's wife approves. Si makes some adjustments, and a hula-hula dancer appears. This is more like it. Si dances along in delight until he swallows his tobacco. More adjustments bring nude women into view, smiling and posed discretely. Has Si found Utopia?
