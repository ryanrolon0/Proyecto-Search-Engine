Teeth

 Two old friends go fishing. One of them, feeling a little under the weather, sneezes and loses his teeth overboard. His friend finds this hilarious and to add to his good cheer he lands an enormous fish. Capitalising on his friends misfortune he plays a prank that backfires badly leaving the pair miserable and toothless.
