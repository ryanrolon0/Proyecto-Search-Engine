Stinky

 The sounds of children at play are in the background as the Angry Kid stands alone in front of a plain brick wall. Sounds of flatulence pop close at hand. The Kid brings his right fist up from behind his back, he sniffs at his index finger, he gags. He tries it again. He gags. He compares it to the smell of the index finger of his left hand proves to be a lot more interesting. Is a whole new addiction in the works?
