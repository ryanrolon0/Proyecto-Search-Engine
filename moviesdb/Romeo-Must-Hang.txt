Romeo Must Hang

 This is a story that transfixed an entire nation for months. A story that came to be immortalized in a classic Hollywood film (Night of the Hunter, starring Robert Mitchum), and even as it has faded into obscurity, its' effect echoes even still - every time the news media latches onto a serial killer, in an attempt to make a profit from scaring the living hell out of you.
