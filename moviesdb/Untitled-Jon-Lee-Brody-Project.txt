Untitled Jon Lee Brody Project

 Lucas Caine has it all. He has wealth, fame, good looks and a beautiful fiance. What he doesn't have is the last 2 years of his life. While battling with a gap in his memory, he soon finds himself in the middle of mayhem. A chain of events happens that leads him on a journey of self realization both physically and spiritually. He encounters people along the way. Some are there to help, Some are not. In a world where nothing is what it appears to be, who can he trust?
