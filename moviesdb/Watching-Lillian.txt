Watching Lillian

 Lillian has been visiting a high-end store on San Francisco's Haight Street for eight years now. She is Chinese, is attracted to women, has a mysterious mental illness, and almost no teeth. And some of the employees have been filming her. This film is not really about Lillian; it is about problematic relationships, and the use of the camera as a way to navigate rocky social territory. Rebecca (the filmmaker) and her coworkers Jim and Monika place their relationships with Lillian under a microscope through discussion, re-enactment, and even fortune-telling. Psychologically sobering and earnest, this experimental documentary asks us to consider the power of the camera, to locate where documentary intersects with exploitation, and to ask 'why do we watch?'
