The Obery Farms Legacy

 Situated in America's heartland, the Obery family has been farming in rural Metamora, Illinois for six generations and over 134 years. What began as a 127-acre farm in 1874 has grown to nearly 3,000 acres. This documentary depicts life on the farm from the beginning when the family moved to the United States from France in the early 1870s and worked through sweat and tears to become the successful and thriving enterprise that it is today.
