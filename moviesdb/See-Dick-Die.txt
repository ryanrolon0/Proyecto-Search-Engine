Meanwhile her husband, Ricky, asks Dr. Schreck for an assisted suicide (euthanasia) scheduled to occur on his birthday. After the husband's passing, life becomes idyllic for the two woman. Moreover, there is the promise of the imminent arrival of a large inheritance of 3 million dollars left by her husband. But the creepy Dr Schreck wont go away, and keeps appearing in the two women's lives.
