The Bene Israel

 This documentary is both an intimate family portrait and a fascinating ethnographic study of the Bene Israel, one of three groups of Jews living in India today. Filmmakers Nathanson and Fernandez spent months living with one family in the Bene Israel community, documenting the family's daily lives and recording the religious and cultural traditions of this unique branch of Judaism. Through stories, songs, family prayer and community ritual, the film introduces the viewer to three generations of Indian Jews.
