Uchuujin from Outer Space

 The earth is about to be exterminated by a huge army of aliens so deadly that you would Poo Poo ya pants if you saw then. The plant's only hope lies with a Super Being known as The Geisha, whose blood is mixed with the blood of Jesus Chirst (Yeah the one from those make believe plays) and her protectors of looney toons known as the Alien Hunters Six. With their I.Q. of 2x2 equals 2,888 yen, these Jag Offs must protect the Chosen One and unleash the all powerful weapon that could annihilate the aliens and save the world. The problen is...Stupidity is their middle name.
