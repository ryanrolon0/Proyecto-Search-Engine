Rest in Beats

 Music legends never die; they Rest In Beats. In the changing world of music, the survival of a pioneering record producer's work can depend solely on whether or not future generations find it worthy. The Rest In Beats film project captures intimate conversations with today's record producers sharing their most profound musical inspirations. Though many of those pioneering influences of modern music have passed away, their work is often survived by the repurposing or remixing efforts of the hit makers they have inspired. Rest In Beats explores the symbiotic relationship between creators across generations, investigating music milestones with a depth that transcends time.
