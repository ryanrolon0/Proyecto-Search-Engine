The Orphan's Mine

 Grace Calvin prospected alone, independent of "man's help" and quite derisive of its efficacy. Ed Corbin, prospecting close by had repeatedly offered himself as her protector for life, but she scorned that sort of help. A day came when Grace hit gold, and that in the presence of Blake Williams, noted bad man. He hurried to a nearby saloon, and, from behind a partition, Ed Corbin overheard the plan. He went himself to Grace's claim, and with a rifle held off the thieves. Later, after the would-be bandits returned to town, stopping for a consoling drink, Ed, entering with the sheriff, saw them. With guns drawn, the bandit backed out of the saloon and scurried out of the country as fast as their horses would carry them. And then, Ed, feeling that his suit had been greatly promoted, hastened to the claim where he found Grace willing to listen to proposals.
