The School

 Based on the short story by award winning author Donald Barthelme, The School is a darkly comedic fable that pushes the boundaries of absurdity and convention. Catering to the wealthy and elite, Sunnybrook Preparatory School is your typical upper class educational institution. Here students are taught the elementary life skills and moral philosophies that will shape the course of their lives. Edgar Gibson's (A.J. Pittis) second grade class is no exception. That is, of course, until everything starts to die. When all the beans die, faulty soil is blamed. When all the fish die, overfeeding is surely the cause. As the death toll mounts Edgar and his students are thrown into a tailspin of angst and confusion. Anything and everything is passing away in record numbers and nobody can figure out why. The students approach Edgar for answers. Together they are forced to reevaluate their notions of mortality.
