Robby

 Shipwrecked on a tropical island, a young boy befriends an aban- doned native youth, forcing him to reevaluate societal prejudice about race, religion and nudity. Two, young boys shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island. A modern Robinson Crusoe legend of friendship and survival. Boys and nature untouched, unspoiled and uninhibited.
