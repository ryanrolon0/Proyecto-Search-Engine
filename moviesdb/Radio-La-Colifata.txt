Radio La Colifata

 Radio la Colifata is the first radio station that broadcasts from a mental hospital, the first radio station that exposes and gives voice to those who don't have the possibility to express themselves. The programs are completely made by the patients of the hospital Jose Borda in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In April 2003 Radio la Colifata organized a symbolic election inside the hospital the day before the real election in Argentina to permit all patients to vote. The results inside and outside are the same.
