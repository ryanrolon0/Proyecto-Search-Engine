Wake Up Sid

 In Mumbai, Sid Mehra is, in the words of his father, an arrogant, spoiled brat. He lives with a doting mother and a father who pays his expenses and credit card bills. Sid takes his college finals then starts work at his father's business; he lasts less than a week before walking out. At a graduation party, he's met Aisha, newly arrived from Calcutta, set on becoming a writer. He shows her the city and helps her refurbish a rented flat. He asks if she'd like to progress from friend to something more; she says no - he lacks ambition and isn't her type. Will her words, his exam results, a confrontation with his parents, and a break with his friends be enough to wake Sid up? Ram Mehra used to live in a shanty Chawl in Jogeshwari, Bombay, but worked hard, married Sarita; opened his own business 'Mehra Furnishings Company'; became the parent of Sidharth; and moved to a bungalow in Juhu. He and Sarita had hoped that Sidharth will be good in his studies, and eventually take over the business. But instead Sidharth turns out to be not only a slacker, but also fails in his final year exams; is rude to his mother, and is asked to leave. Sidharth moves out to live with his new-found friend, Aisha Banerjee, fresh from Kolkata, who has just landed a job with Mumbai Beats, and is in love with her boss, Kabir Chaudhary. She permits Sidharth to live with her, but ends up frustrated when she realizes that he cannot cook nor clean up after himself, and is very childish and immature. With daily arguments ensuing between the two, it will not be long before Sidharth may have to move out again - but where will Sidharth - with all doors closed in on him - move out to now?
