Twilight on the Prairie

 The Buckaroos, cowboy musicians, are forced down at Little Lip, Texas, while flying to Hollywood to make their first movie. Band members Bucky, Phil, Jack, Chuck and Ginger find a "no vacancy" sign at the hotel. A sudden mining boom has exploded the population and, in fact, lured the local cowhands to the mines, leaving the Bar-B ranch foreman, Cactus, short-handed and short-tempered. Desperate for a place to sleep, the Buckaroos check their instruments and sign on as Bar-B ranch hands, planning to resign the next morning. They find the Bar-B owned by Sally Barton. Their true identity is discovered and the town telegrapher tells the world that the Bucharoos are doing their war bit by helping out with the harvest. When Hollywood calls, and Bucky and his pals leave, Sally thinks Bucky used the Bar-B and her to gain publicity. But Bucky talks the producer into shooting the picture at the ranch so the harvest can be completed, and he and Sally are reconciled.
