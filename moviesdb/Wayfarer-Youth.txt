Wayfarer Youth

 Wayfarer Youth is a slightly experimental short film that was made by two friends on no budget. There is a Jack Kerouac 'On The Road' element to the short film, both in the making of it and while watching it. The poetry in this film flows out like a novel written by one of the Beat Era's forefathers. The film opens with a young man running frantically down an open road. He seems to be worried, panicked, scared and struggling. Where has he been? What is wrong? Where is he going? He staggers through a vast forest, only to find a mysterious abandoned building. There, he explores, reflecting on his past, trying to find solace and inner harmony.
