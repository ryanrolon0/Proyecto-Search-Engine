Sunkist Stars at Palm Springs

 Winners of the Lucky Stars National Dance Contest - one woman from each of the United States - are welcomed to Palm Springs. Palm Springs being the desert playground for the movie stars, the women are introduced to the cavalcade of stars vacationing in Palm Springs at the time. The stars are doing a multitude of recreational activities. One of those stars is 'Frances Langford' (qv), fresh from Broadway, who serenades all those watching with some Broadway related songs. With assistance from 'Jackie Coogan' (qv) and 'Betty Grable' (qv), the contest winners do a series of dances to American songs. They then get a chance to interact with the stars, all in the name of fun.
