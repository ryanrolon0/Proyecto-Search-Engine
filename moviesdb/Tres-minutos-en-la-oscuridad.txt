 Four childhood friends decide to play a prank on an aunt of one of the four. Two enter the house and two others remain waiting in the car. When the alarm goes off, the two waiting in the car escape, leaving the other two to escape on their own. After that, the friends begin distrusting each other wondering what really happened during those three minutes in the dark inside the house.
