Stay the Same Never Change

 Stay the Same Never Change stars amateur actors in Kansas City. Though the story is scripted, the movie is shot in the actors' real homes, so that the end result is a mix of visual fact and narrative fiction. It's a story about people and the lives they're living while wanting more. Whether it's a family man looking for beauty or a young woman obsessed with polar bears and Oprah, the characters in this film reveal quiet lives full of sadness and desire.
