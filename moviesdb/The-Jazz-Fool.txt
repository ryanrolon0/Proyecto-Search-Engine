The Jazz Fool

 Horace pulls a wagon with a a small pipe organ, with Mickey at the keys; a sign on the side reads "Mickey's Big Road Show." They arrive, and Mickey's suitcase labeled "Jazz Fool" unfolds to a piano, which he plays (and sings about 8 notes). At the end, the piano attacks him. There is no dialogue, aside from the nonsense syllables sung.
