Tilbage til Bagdad

 While the United States and it's allies aim their riffles on Iraq, a Danish girl and her Iraque father travel into the heart of Iraq. They want to see their family for maybe the last time before the war breaks loose. The documentary crew succeed in avoiding Saddam Hussein's border controls who usually follow and observe every movement of Western crews in Iraq. Therefore this documentary presents a unique view upon the lives of the inhabitants who for 12 years - ever since the end of the Gulf War - have been under the influence of countless UN sanctions and Saddam Hussein's dictatorship.
