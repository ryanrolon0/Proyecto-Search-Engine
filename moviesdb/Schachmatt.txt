Schachmatt

 "Checkmate" is a case study in American and Soviet foreign policy. It shows the inner workings of their propaganda machinery and covert operations, outlining why the USA needed the Rumanian revolution in order to win the Cold War. With this extraordinary insight into the subject matter, "Checkmate" shows the extent to which these international political intrigues were interwoven with the process of Germany's reunification and the demise of the Soviet Union.
