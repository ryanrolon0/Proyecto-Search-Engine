Savable Wins

 Showing the start of the Futurity; the sweep down the stretch of the pack of high bred colts under the whip; John A. Drake's Savable winning by a nose; the return of the horses to the post after the race; and finally the victorious jockey Lyne walking toward the paddock. A great horse racing picture.
