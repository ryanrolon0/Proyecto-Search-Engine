Savage Messiah

 Based on real-life events in Canada in the late 1980's, social worker Paula Jackson investigated a commune run by a messiah-like figure who referred to himself as Moses. Jackson's findings uncovered disturbing mental and physical abuses of this cult's members by its maniacal leader. Soon, Jackson found herself fighting to save Moses's followers.
