The Housetaurant

 Charlie waits for his girlfriend, Caroline, in their New York apartment. He suspects that she is about to leave him and has slipped a vindictive letter into her bag, hoping she will discover it and realize his distrust and pain. Charlie changes his mind just as Caroline arrives home and makes a desperate attempt to retrieve the letter without her knowing. It backfires; sending the couple deep into territory neither is prepared for.
