Toronto - New York

 Toronto based jazz string bassist 'Brandi Disterheft' (qv) is trying to make a mark in the jazz music scene in New York City. She discusses trying to find her own niche within the scene, in which one has to distinguish oneself. Her continuing musical evolution is one of learning through meeting other like minded musicians and performing. This process builds upon her days as a music student at Humber College in Toronto, where she really came to want to be a jazz musician professionally and believe that she could do it. Her musings about her life are overlaid on top of rehearsals with friends, and performances in New York jazz clubs.
