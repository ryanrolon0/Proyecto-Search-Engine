The Lady Police

 A mayor, up for re-election and angling for the female vote, appoints a suffragette as chief of police. She proceeds to add several women to the force, redecorate the jail, and soon finds that the town's male population is going out of their way to get arrested, much to the dismay of their wives, who decide to take matters into their own hands.
