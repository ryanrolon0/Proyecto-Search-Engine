Robert Clary A5714

 Robert Clary, the French actor who portrayed Louis Lebeau in the long-running American television series Hogan's Heroes, is a Holocaust survivor and the subject of this very personal, unpretentious documentary. Born Robert Max Widerman in 1926 in France, Clary is one of 16 children whose Jewish parents had emigrated from Poland. Clary returns to Europe in search of his own story; he relives his happy childhood in the streets of Paris, his incarceration at Drancy, and his horror at Buchenwald. See also Imaginary Witness
