The Brothers Carry-Mouse-Off

 Tom tries setting out things to lure Jerry into a trap, but Jerry, riding on Tom, picks them up as Tom puts them down. Tom chases Jerry upstairs, where he runs out a door to the outside. Tom puts on a lady mouse costume and plays the ukulele and is suddenly surrounded by dozens of amorous mice then hungry cats.
