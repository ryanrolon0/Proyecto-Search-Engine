 Since 1963 when Matias Santos family became sick and began dying , Matias pledged to God to save his family by imitating the sufferings of the lord Jesus Christ. Through a grueling event called Tira Bakal the Santos family tradition is kept alive as the family honor their late grandfather as they continue the tradition for the family and their community.
