The Wayward Canary

 Mickey gives Minnie a canary. Soon there are severl little canaries; they get into the inkwell and fly around the house, making a mess, though it's nothing compared to the shambles Mickey makes of the house while chasing them. Mickey is happy because he's brought a gift for Minnie, a pair of canaries inside of their cage. At the house, Minnie hangs the cage near of the window. But Pluto starts to feel a little bit jealous, and from one moment to another, the canaries start to multiple themselves and they scape from the cage. Mickey's very surprised, as well as Minnie. Pluto gets nervous, because the canaries are flying all over the place, playing with ink, which causes that the little birds look like two small crows. All the place is stained with the canaries little foot prints, and the birds make all kind of patterns with their feathers.
