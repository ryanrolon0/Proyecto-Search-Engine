The Last Journey

 A 90-year-old woman is taken on a trip (both in space and time) back to where she was born and spent her youth to watch her bid her last good-byes to all her living or dead relatives and friends from her past. She visits spiritually charged locations of her childhood for one last time and we watch her immerse into her vivid memories dating many years ago and stretched through various epochs.
