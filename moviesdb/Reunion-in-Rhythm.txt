Reunion in Rhythm

 At the Adams school, students and alumni gather for a musical talent show. Buckwheat wants badly to be an actor and keeps breaking into a recitation of "Little Jack Horner" when he's supposed to be announcing the acts. Spanky is at his wit's end trying to keep the show moving without Buckwheat's interpolations. Darla serenades Porky, Spanky does a song-and-dance number, Alfalfa's solo is upstaged by a rooster, and no one seems to be amazed at the set, which must have cost more than the school building.
