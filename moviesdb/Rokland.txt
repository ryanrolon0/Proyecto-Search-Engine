Rokland

 The tragicomic story of lone rebel Boddi Steingrimsson who lives in a small town in Northern Iceland. Boddi hates materialistic modern society in its entirety and on his blog-page he comically criticizes everything and everyone. Before long he has become an outlaw in his own hometown, just like his viking hero, Grettir. After a series of dramatic mishaps, he snaps and goes riding down south to the big city on his sturdy steed Nietzsche. He's got a gun in his pocket. He's ready for the revolution. Böddi (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) returns to the village of Krókur after 10 years of studies in Germany and he's going to change the way Icelandic people think. On his blog he preaches noble, highbrow German ideals mixed with Viking Era romanticism. He's a bit too enthusiastic and is fired from his teaching position at the local high school after an ill-advised trip with his students to Drangey Island. Being a man of ideals, Böddi continues his crusade but has little luck. The girl he loves doesn't want him and the one he's using ends up using him. On his blog he continues to criticizes everything and everyone, much to the locals' dismay. Nothing will change in Krókur Village. So Böddi rides south to the big city of Reykjavík on his sturdy steed Nietzsche. He's got a gun in his pocket and noble ideas for the people. He's ready for his revolution. And his revolution is quite real.
