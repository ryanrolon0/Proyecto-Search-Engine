The Second Room

 Stanley, an isolated architect, has spent a lifetime confined in the "first room" of missed opportunities and unspoken words. He encounters Moira, a woman who Stanley believes has found fulfillment. He follows her, seduced by the pleasure of watching her daily activities. Through a dark and complex relationship navigated on the narrow ledge between fantasy and reality, Stanley follows Moira's path into the "second room" to find his own completion.
