The Paper Chase

 Hart is a confused first year law student at Harvard. He is trying to survive the year under his strictest professer, the legendary Kingsfield. With the help of some of his classmates in his study group, Hart becomes one of the smartest students in his class. His reputation with Kingsfield is diminished, however, when he finds out the girl he has been seeing is Kingfields daughter. Will Hart perform to the best of his ability with Kingsfield watching his every move? Hart is a first year law student, desperately trying to impress his sternest professer, Kingsfield. Hart is overwhelmed with the pressure, the work, and his fear of failure. He meets Susan and begins an affair with her, discovering that she is Kingsfield's daughter. Not really love story as much as it is a becoming an adult tale.
