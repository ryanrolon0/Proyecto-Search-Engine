The Cold

 Idaho, USA. Seven friends head off into the wilderness to begin their annual hunting trip. As a snow storm gathers the big white out starts. Snowed in, cold and isolated, the men begin to question their friendship and loyalties. Soon they are terrorised by an unseen beast. What is stalking them? Is it the cold, the starvation or has a cannibalistic creature which can take the human form come to hunt them?
