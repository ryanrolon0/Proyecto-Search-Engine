Red Flag

 Two fighter pilots (Devane and Bostwick) who flew together in Vietnam are assigned to the elite Air Force Fighter Weapons School (known as "Red Flag") at Nellis AFB, Nevada about a decade after the war. Brash, self-confident Devane is an instructor, while quieter, family man Bostwick is the student. At first, the two men resume their friendship. But as the student starts to show the master a thing or two, tensions develop. Can their relationship survive the stresses of one of the military's top schools?
