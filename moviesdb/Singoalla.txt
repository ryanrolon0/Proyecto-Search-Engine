Singoalla

 In 14th Century Sweden, when Lorld Erland Maneskold marries Singoalla, a gypsy, he abandons his worldly possessions. The gypsies, who meanwhile have stolen the Maneskold treasure, want the couple to join their caravan to escape detection. A jealous suitor makes Erland think Singoalla has betrayed him, and he returns to his castle, where a battle between the gypsies and the landed-gentry ensues. Ten years later, Sorgbarn, the son born to Singoalla from the brief marriage sets out to find his father Erland. He does and tries to bring his parents together. He succeeds briefly, but is hurt in an accident and dies. Erland's mind snaps when Singoalla is killed by a vindictive gypsy and he retires to his castle, demented and alone.
