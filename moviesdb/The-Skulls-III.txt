The Skulls III

 Taylor Brooks is a young, overachieving coed at a posh New England college whom decides to pledge the secret society The Skulls whom her father and many of the faculty are members and whom her older brother died years earlier during an initiation practice. But Taylor's willingness to break the all-male Skulls taboo of pledging as the first woman to do so put her at odds with the other pledges and alumni members. When she finally succeeds in fulfilling her membership despite inference from the Skull members, she soon finds herself in hot water when her boyfriend is found murdered, and she's accused of the crime. Taylor must find a way to prove her innocence and find the real killer despite the fact that no one around her can be trusted.
