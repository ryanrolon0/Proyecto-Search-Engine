The Hot Heiress

 He is one of the best riveters in the union, but he is still a day laborer. She comes from money, but when they saw each other, it was love at first sight. They date, they dance, they fall for each other. First, she had to say no to Clay, which was easy. Then she had to bring Hap to meet her parents, which was not easy. Hap is the wrong type, but he dislikes their lifestyle as much as they do his. But if it is to work, he will be the sole support of Juliette and he cares not for her money.
