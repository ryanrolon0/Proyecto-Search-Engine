Rickie Lee Jones

 2010 marked the 30th anniversary of the dawn of Rickie Lee Jones' storied recording career, which exploded in 1979 with her self-titled debut album and its top 10 hit, "Chuck E.'s in Love." Jones had an immediate impact on pop culture, enjoying the massive buzz of an indelible SNL appearance and an instantaneous Rolling Stone cover, all while winning a Grammy for Best New Artist. Three decades' worth of acclaimed creative journeys have ensued with both her singing and writing "voice" remaining, despite her pervasive and incalculable influence on two or three entire generations of singer/songwriters, among the most distinctive and instantly recognizable in music. As evidence, March 7, 2010 a very special night in Stockholm, Sweden. Rickie Lee Jones - Live in Stockholm was filmed at the historic and regal venue known as Berns Salonger, built in 1862. With massive crystal chandeliers, gilded walls, and paintings of Swedish royalty throughout, Berns is a venue fit for a queen. Rickie delivered to a packed house the best of her catalog from her debut album all the way up to her latest release "Balm in Gilead" Pirates, Bonfire, Chuck E's in Love, We Belong Together - it's all captured on this remarkable evening that no one in attendance will likely forget. The show is simply mesmerizing, Rickie's voice tops. Rickie took the crowd on a captivating journey though the stories and songs created by her poetry painted by music. The brilliantly harmonized back up vocals provided by bassist Joey Maramba and drummer Lionel Cole prove to be the icing on top of Rickie's smooth velvet cake. This unique concert film was conceived and directed by Grammy nominated director Ian McCrudden (Anita O'Day - The Life of a Jazz Singer). Rickie Lee Jones - Live in Stockholm solidifies her place in music history and proves why Rickie Lee Jones is still one of the best singer-songwriters of all time.
