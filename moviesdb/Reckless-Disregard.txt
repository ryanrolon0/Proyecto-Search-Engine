Reckless Disregard

 Meredith Craig is lawyer who has a small practice. She is then approached by a Dr. Lucas who is a doctor at a clinic, who was exposed on a television news program as writing prescriptions for drugs in exchange for money. He says that he is innocent and asks Meredith to file a lawsuit against the program and its staff. Can a small lawyer beat a big television network?
