The Withering

 A man lost in madness, can't decipher illusion from reality. Joseph Blanco casts himself in his own hellish prison of the mind. This psychological drama is suspenseful and thought provoking. The intensity and potency of the main character is prevalent through experimental visual compositions, special effects, and diverse camera angles. Is hopelessness just a tragedy away? How immune is anyone from indulging in fantasy when truth is much too macabre? These questions and much more are explored in this delightfully disturbing picture.
