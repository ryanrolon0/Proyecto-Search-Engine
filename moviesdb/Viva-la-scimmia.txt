Viva la scimmia

 Two spinsters, one a religious fanatic in thrall to a TV preacher, live with their elderly mother, a corrupt, randy maid and a pet monkey inherited from their dead father in an apartment of the Dickensian condo they own. The maid marries for money but scorns her husband in favour of a younger lover. Meanwhile the pet monkey secretly lets himself out of his cage at night to desecrate a nearby convent.
