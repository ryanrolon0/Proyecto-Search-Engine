Retribuiaão

 This movie belongs to the "Ciclo de Recife" ("Recife Cycle") and was destroyed. There are only fragments of the first reel in the "Cinemateca do MAM" (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The beginning of the story shows a young woman being informed by her dying father of a treasure he left for her buried in the woods. Later, this woman helps a man wounded after an assault by a gangster. When he is heeled, he pays a visit to her, and she discloses to him her hidden inheritance. One criminal listens to their conversation... and unfortunately the rest of the movie was destroyed.
