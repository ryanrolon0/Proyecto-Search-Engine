The Return of Jack Slade

 Jack Slade, son of the famed lawman and man-hunter, is hired by a Pinkerton detective, Joseph Ryan, to help wipe out a gang of outlaws and train robbers, Billy Wilcox, Hary Sutton and Little Blue Raven, and their women, Texas Rose, Polly Logan and Laughing Sam. Slades gets off to a slow beginning when his gun is taken away from him by Texas Rose during a train robbery. Learning from Ryan the location of the gang hideout, Slade leaves his pal Johnny Turner behind and joins the gang as a wanted outlaw. Turner, looking for Slade, is shot down by Sutton, and Slade vows revenge and, with Ryan's help, sets a trap for the gang.
