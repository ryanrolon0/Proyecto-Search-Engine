Vespers

 One man's search for survivors in the remains of humanity. Vespers takes its name from Christian evening prayers, often recited in order to protect the soul from things that go bump in the night. Vespers sees our hero pondering his existence as he witnesses death and destruction on a scale never seen before. Though weather beaten, hungry and tired he relentlessly continues his search, finding only horror and ruin. His journey ends at Brunel's famous Clifton Suspension bridge (Bristol, UK), where so many lives have ended. Just as he is about to give up all hope he finds a new beginning. Directed by David Lilley and Stephen Gray Vespers is another visual treat, throwing punch after punch of carefully designed destruction.
