The Startled Lover

 "This scene is in a parlor. A young man is making love to his sweetheart. They quarrel; and the lover turns away in pique. As he turns back, the girl changes like a flash into a skeleton, to her lover's great amazement and terror. While he is still trembling with fear the skeleton vanishes and the girl reappears, smiling and beckoning her lover to return to her side."
