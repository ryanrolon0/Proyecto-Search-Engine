Stull

 In 1993, four teens went to investigate an abandoned church in Stull, Kansas -- a place rumored to be a gate to Hell. They were never heard from again. 'Stull' shows the events leading up to their disappearance, including an encounter with a strange man who may be the Devil himself. The story is based on the chilling real-life legend.
