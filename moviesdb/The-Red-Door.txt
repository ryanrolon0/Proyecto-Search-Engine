The Red Door

 You have a Feng Shui consultation with Thomas Yang, an aspiring young chef, er, Feng Shui Master from the longest line of masters in Chinese history. When Thomas' father passes away, Thomas is left to take on the family business and drop out of culinary school, even though becoming a chef was all he ever wanted. Disgruntled by his new path, he haphazardly takes on the day-to-day duties of being Feng Shui Master. Because of his family's reputation, clients follow his sometimes puzzling Feng Shui advice. That is, until he meets Becky, who can tell he's making it all up. Still, Thomas is haunted by his father's legacy and struggles between having to uphold family tradition and honor out of responsibility and obligation, and pursuing his dreams and what he is truly passionate about. Which path will he finally take?
