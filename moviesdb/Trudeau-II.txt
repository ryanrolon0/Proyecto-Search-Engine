Trudeau II

 Born into privilege and wealth, Pierre Trudeau was a boy who grew to value something more in his life. Disgusted with the tyrannical regime of Maurice Duplesis' governance of Quebec with the eager approval of the Catholic Church, Trudeau gains his basic ideals of rights and justice as he joins the fight for a more open society. Although initially hampered by his naive zealousness and his indulgent playboy habits, we see Trudeau gain the skills and the contacts that would help him become the Prime Minister that would redefine a nation.
