Vincent Who?

 In 1982, Vincent Chin was murdered in Detroit by two white autoworkers at the height of anti-Japanese sentiments. His killers, however, got off with a $3,000 fine and no jail time. Outraged by this injustice, Asian Americans around the country united for the first time to form a pan-Asian identity and civil rights movement. This documentary, based off a series of townhalls organized by Asian Pacific Americans for Progress, features interviews with the key players at the time as well as a whole new generation of activists whose lives have been impacted by the case. The documentary asks how far Asian Americans have come since then and how far they have yet to go.
