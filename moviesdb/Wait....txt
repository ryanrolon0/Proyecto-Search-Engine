Wait...

 Paige, a reclusive writer, suffers from an overwhelming fear of the dark and the outside world. Each evening she types the same story repeatedly, while envisioning the brutal attack of two sisters. One night while typing, noises echo from the attic. Curiosity ascends her to investigate, where she stumbles upon a box of remnants from the women in her visions. Is Paige being haunted or is it all inside her mind?
