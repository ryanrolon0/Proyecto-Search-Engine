The Range

 According to the Federal Communications Commission there are over 13,000 radio stations in the United States but only one, THE RANGE. The Range explores one of the most unique radio stations in the United States, KHYI also known as The Range. In an age when media conglomerates dominate both public and private radio stations KHYI is one of the last family owned and operated FM stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. As Nashville finds itself increasing dependent on the power of corporations, marketing focus groups, and consultants KHYI plays what its listeners call OKOM, Our Kind of Music, Hard Country. The Good Fight Digital Motion Pictures combines musical elements with documentary filmmaking to tell the story of the last stand for the virtue of country music, KHYI, The Range.
