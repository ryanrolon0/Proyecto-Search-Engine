Sacred City of the Mayan Indians

 We visit Chichicastenango, a Mayan city in central Guatemala. Indians have remained Mayan while adapting some features of European culture architecture, dress, and religion have White influences, but the people's personality - their control of emotion from childhood - the use of the cochineal for dye, hand-ground corn in the diet, the absence of horses and wheels to save labor, and the presence of pagan fires on the steps of churches, all give a Mayan character to the town.
