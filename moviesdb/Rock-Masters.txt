Rock Masters

 ROCK MASTERS tells the story about the life and career of the fictional Austrian rock star Joseph 'Joe Hellmouth' Hinterstueberl (Tom Kersten) in the manner of an MTV Masters Documentary. Besides excerpts from concerts and music videos you see friends, collegues and critics of the superstar talking about him in interviews. Highlights are the interview sequences with the arrogant star himself, as he obviously has lost every connection to reality. ROCK MASTERS is Satire, Comedy and Media Scolding. A student production that is totally overdrawn!
