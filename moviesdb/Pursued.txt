Pursued

 Wall Street's leading headhunter Vincent Palmer isn't just extremely good in finding the ideal executives for corporate top jobs and offering them a deal hard to resist. His special knack is making them sign even if they really don't want to. Such a hard nut is Benjamin 'Ben' Keats, who invented a brilliant persons tracking device and is committed to his parters and staff to use it to launch their firm VizTrack on the stock exchange. Vincent pulls all seductive stops with Ben, his wife and daughter, in vain. Then he hints even murder is in his repertoire. Ben checks out that's true but decides ti fight back.
