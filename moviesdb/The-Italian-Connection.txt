The Italian Connection

 A TV camera crew is investigating the progress of the 'Betuwe Route', a huge undertaking by the Dutch government in building a rail road track from the port of Rotterdam to the border of Germany. In the process they find themselves locked in a sea container and travel virtually along the track, starting from the harbor of Shanghai to Rotterdam and then over the track to Zevenaar, at the German border.
