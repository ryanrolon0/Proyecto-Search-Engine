Track 11

 On a long forgotten ex-Soviet bloc country computer still tied to the internet, in a dark back room at an isolated research facility is a file containing a CD of music. One track, Track 11 keeps disappearing when a CD is burned from the file. Jules and her ex-fiance discover the song and play it. This track was created as a mind control or psy-ops experiment long ago, and then lost during the breakup of the Soviet Union, like countless other weapons. It is accidentally released to the world. If music can soothe the nerves, like playing classical music on the drive home from work in order to decompress, and certain paint colors can set a mood, why can't the opposite be true? Why can't an image or a color - or a sound - cause a form of dementia? Can a song drive the listener insane?
