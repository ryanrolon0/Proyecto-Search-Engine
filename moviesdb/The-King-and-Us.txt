The King and Us

 As the world watched Elvis Presley get drafted into the U.S. Army, and then shipped off to Germany for military service, in the background, fellow inductee Rex Mansfield was to become the King's closest friend in the Army. Once in Germany, Elvis meets the beautiful Elisabeth Stefaniek, who becomes Elvis' girlfriend, and live in personal secretary. As their personal relationships with Elvis both flourish, Rex and Elisabeth suddenly find themselves in a secret forbidden love affair of their own, which starts in Germany and burns right on through all the way to Graceland, even after Elvis and Rex finish their tour of duty.
