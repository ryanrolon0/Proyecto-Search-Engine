Ritual der schwarzen Sonne

 60 years ago Antonin Artaud started on a voyage to the North of Mexico to get to know the rituals of the Tarahumara indians. He described this voyage in several papers. Many travellers to the Sierra Tarahumara followed his traces. After his return he was locked up in psychiatric clinics until shortly before his death. The film reconstructs authentically Artaud's route of the shaman. Behind the fear and fascination of the unknown Artaud senses another order. "I shall find the real drama" he writes. "It need not be on the stage".
