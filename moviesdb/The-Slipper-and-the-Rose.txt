The Slipper and the Rose

 In the tiny kingdom of Euphrania, the King and his court are most anxious to get Prince Edward wed. But Edward wants to marry for love. Meanwhile, young Cinderella finds life drastically altered with her father's death as she's forced to be a servant in her own house. But a cheery fairy godmother helps her with her impossible tasks, and even gets her to take an evening out at the King's bride-finding ball. But when the magic wears off, and the prince with shoe-in-hand searches for Cinderella and finds her, what is going to happen to Euphrania without the needed marriage alliance to prevent war? Beautiful version of the classic Cinderella story, as Prince Edward, heir to the throne of Euphrania, is expected by his father the King and his mother the Queen to choose a wife and settle down. To this end, they plan a court ball to which all the princesses they can locate will be invited. Meanwhile, young Cinderella has just lost her beloved father. But things go from bad to worse for her, when her selfish stepmother and spoiled stepsisters reduce her to the status of a servant in her own home. Thankfully, however, her Fairy Godmother is waiting in the wings to see that she goes to the ball and meet the prince. The rest is up to them...
