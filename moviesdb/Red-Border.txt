Red Border

 As a young mother struggles to feed her children, a newly arrived Russian Major takes control over his assigned post. Red Border/Rote Grenze is based on a true story about Vivianne Wolff, a Canadian woman trapped inside Berlins Russian Sector at the end of World War II. Alone after her husbands arrest, she must rely on her instincts and courage to survive. As the new regime takes reign over this zone, just leaving home could prove disastrous.
