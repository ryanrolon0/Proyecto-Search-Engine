Videotape

 A young woman, pregnant, is found dead in a warehouse near a local college. She appears to have committed suicide. In a few months, three more bodies are found. Seeing the opportunity for a compelling story, a freelance journalist conducts an interview with a reclusive key witness. Sealed in a world filled with alcohol, cocaine, and depression, the key witness lays out a story of a young couple in a losing battle against the new pressures of adulthood; a group of kids fighting unmanageable change; and a young man who strikes out in desperation against his peers. Through voyeuristic, vEritE-style footage, 'VIDEOTAPE' illustrates a modern generation with no direction, struggling to reconcile the bleak reality that faces them. With a unique narrative structure and a combination of traditional and organic footage, we invite you to experience a motion picture event like never before.
