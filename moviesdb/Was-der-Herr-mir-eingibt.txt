 "At a certain point I realized that I was in love with Jesus." Konrad and Michael are students at a priest seminary in Italy, where their daily routine is ordered by strict regulations.

The documentary dips into the world behind schools' walls letting the young men talk about their thoughts, dreams and doubts in life.
