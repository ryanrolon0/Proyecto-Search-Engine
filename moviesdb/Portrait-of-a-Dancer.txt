Portrait of a Dancer

 Hamsa Moily is an experimental dancer who is searching for her language. She is caught between two worlds. As if perched on an edge, she loves dancing on the scaffolding, ready to take a leap of faith. Double exposure and staccato edits are used to try and reveal the gossamer layers of her mind. A skip bleach of the negative brings a subconscious quality to her world. This is her portrait.
