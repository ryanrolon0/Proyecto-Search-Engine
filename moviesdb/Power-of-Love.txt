 In rural Kenya, we discover a group of Maasai warriors who express a bizarre fascination with the Canadian musical icon, Celine Dion. Through interviews about the role that her music has played in their lives, we reveal endearing perspectives on love and relationships. A funny and refreshing take on the social documentary norm.
