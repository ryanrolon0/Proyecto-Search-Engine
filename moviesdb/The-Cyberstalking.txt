The Cyberstalking

 Aspiring songstress Holly Moon admires the famous diva "Samantha" and attempts to sneak her own act on stage, in the same elite futuristic techno club. With a weird stroke of luck, Holly succeeds, but is unaware that "Samantha" really appears only with the help of an illegal, secret military computer program. The program uses the imagination of a real person to create a total virtual reality environment. At the club, the MC introduces Holly with the line, "Welcome to the Imagination of Holly Moon." A fantastic environment and performance unfolds from within the subject's own lofty aspirations. Holly also doesn't know that a "glitch" in the program has murdered the real "Samantha," and that she, Holly Moon is slated as its next victim.
