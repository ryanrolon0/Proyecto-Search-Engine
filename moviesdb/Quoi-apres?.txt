Quoi apres?

 Etienne was 16 years old when he died on January 6th 1999. He was my only brother and after a brain operation for a tumor at 4 months old, he became physically and mentally handicapped. Following my parents in their mourning experience, I'm trying to find tracks of him through a family portrait.
