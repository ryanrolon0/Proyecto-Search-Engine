Repas de bEbE

 Like all the early Lumiere Brothers shorts, this consists of just one shot, of Auguste Lumiere, his wife and baby daughter having breakfast. in a rural setting. In itself completely banal, the shot derives its power from the fact that shows us living people filmed in a real setting over a hundred years ago. It is also historically important for being part of the original Lumiere Brothers film programme shown on December 28, 1895
