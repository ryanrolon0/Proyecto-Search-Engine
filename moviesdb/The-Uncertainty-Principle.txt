The Uncertainty Principle

 Two strangers, Elizabeth, (a physicist) and Nellie (a beautician), wait anxiously in a doctor's surgery. Elizabeth is determinedly trying not to think about cancer, but Nellie's brash manner completely invades her quiet reverie. Despite or perhaps because of Nellie's flamboyant artificial opinions about cosmetic surgery; her own and others, Elizabeth warms to this stranger, even though Nellie's confidence is ultimately undermined as her real identity begins to unravel.
