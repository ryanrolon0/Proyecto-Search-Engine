The Lone Star Vigilantes

 Just after Rebel soldiers Bill and Tex return to Texas after the Civil war, Northerner Major Clark arrives with troops, declares martial law, and disarms the citizens. Bill eventually learns Clark is a fake and rides to the fort for help. But the Commander says he needs proof and when Bill returns he finds Tex in jail and about to be hung. In the third of the eight-film series co-starring Bill Elliott (Wild Bill Hickok) and Tex Ritter (Tex Martin), they are returning Civil-War veterans who come home to Winchester, Texas and discover armed bandits, masquerading as U.S. Army troops and the town and territory under martial law. The fake army is led by a fake Major Holland Clark, in reality a wanted renegade named Keller. Bill rides to get help from the Fort Grande authorities, but is refused aid for lack of proof. Bill returns to find Tex, who had formed a citizen's vigilantes band, held prisoner by the renegade and his henchmen, and about to be hung. Bill helps Tex escape and, together, they set out to smash the carpet-bagging outlaws.
