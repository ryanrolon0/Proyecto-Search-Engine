Unison

 In the high tech city Twin Ships, dancing is prohibited by Emperor Ducker and anyone who is caught dancing is arrested and banned from the city. The three girls Trill, Cela, and Chilly were instructed by Dr. Dance to use their dancing performance and airjack the airwaves and make the Ducker fans their fans. Can the three girls also known as the super dance team, "Unison" be able to bring freedom of dancing back to Twin Ships?
