The Best Sex

 Paul, the owner of Duke's Coffee shop, is a bookworm, agoraphobe who starred in adult movies when he was in his teens. He is far too angry at himself to forgive anyone. He tells himself that he's searching for something, but he's really just waiting for something new to come to him. Enter Rene, a reality TV writer who specializes in scripting male tantrums.
