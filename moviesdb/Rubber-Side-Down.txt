Rubber Side Down

 It is an epic Canadian adventure best summed up in three words Coast. Spanning over three months in the summer of 2008, two amateur cyclists would attempt to pedal 8000 km from Victoria, British Columbia to St. John's, Newfoundland, in an effort to shed light on Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis- tragic bowel diseases that are in dire need of a voice. What they discovered will astound you. Experience a film that depicts the vastness of our land, the spirit of our people, and a struggle that unites us.
