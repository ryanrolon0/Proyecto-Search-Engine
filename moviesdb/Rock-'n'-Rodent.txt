Rock 'n' Rodent

 Jerry heads out to his night job basement of a high-rise. They are loud enough to wake up Tom, despite his attempts to block the noise. Tom's attempts keep running him afoul of a rather mean-tempered dog. Tom is setting his alarm clock and going to bed just as Jerry, who sleeps with a alarm wristwatch around his bed, wakes up for work. Jerry is a drummer for an all-mouse band in an all-mouse nightclub. The mice there are too hip to betray much excitement, but a female hipster allows herself a single scream before returning to sullenness and allowing her anthropomorphic hair to do the dancing for her. Jerry's nightclub may be in the basement of the high-rise apartment building where he and Tom live; but the noise reaches right up to Tom, whose eardrums pulse with every beat. Meanwhile, Tom's crafty tricks to stop the noise manage to do nothing but get him in trouble with a big, angry dog.
