Watergate Plus 30

 This documentary reviews the events and outcomes of what has simply been known as Watergate. On June 17, 1972 a group of burglars were arrested trying to bug the telephones at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office complex. For over two years, the story of the Watergate break-in and the ensuing cover up dominated U.S. political life. It eventually led to the resignation of Richard Nixon, 37th President of the United States in August 1974 when recorded conversations revealed that he had been less than honest with the public and had been an active participant in the cover-up.
