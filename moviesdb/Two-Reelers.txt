Two Reelers

 Two bumbling college students named Stephen and Rodger drop out of school and decide to travel around the world. In the first episode of this proposed series, the duo end up in Latin American where they are taken hostage by bank robbers. Were the series to have been ordered by NBC, the forthcoming episodes would have followed the two in their adventures around the globe.
