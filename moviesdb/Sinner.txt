Sinner

 Yotam, a thirteen year-old boy studying at an ultra-orthodox Jewish boarding school tries to battle the awakening of his sexual desires. Confused and guilt-ridden, he consults with his rabbi who abuses his position and Yotam's innocence. With no one to trust and nowhere to go, Yotam finds himself trapped by the enforced silence in his community.
