 Darius, a musical prodigy and baby of the Motown era, is on his way to the Grammy awards. As he rides, flashbacks of his past--a promiscuous single mother and the realities of life in the poverty-stricken streets of Detroit--haunt his present. The tragedy of his mother and the separation from his baby sister has forced Darius to deal with the world by his terms--through his music.
