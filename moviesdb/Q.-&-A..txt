Q. & A.

 In February 2006, 12-year-old Joshua Littman and his mother, Sarah, recorded an interview at StoryCorps. Joshua was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism, when he was 5 years old. His mother describes it as being "born without social genes". Kids with Asperger's have a hard time socially, and can have obsessions - for Joshua, it's animals. While most StoryCorps participants use a list of suggested questions, Joshua wrote his own, and they were truly one-of-kind.
