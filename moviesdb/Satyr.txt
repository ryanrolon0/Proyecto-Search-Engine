Satyr

 A flickering fire in a pit casts shadows on a cave wall of a couple, half-human, half-animal, engaged in sex. The shadows have tails and small horns. There's a sense of something strangely primitive, almost mythological... Director Michael Zen takes you on a journey into the netherworld. A mystical place where angels fear to tread & debauchery runs rampant.
