The Circle of Death

 Indians attack a wagon train killing everyone except a young baby boy. 24 years later the boy, now known as Little Buffalo, becomes involved in outlaws attempt to get the Carr ranch. Then have cheated Carr's son at cards causing him to run up a big debt and then forced him to sell his father's cattle that he doesn't own. When they try to take the cattle, Little Buffalo and his braves go into action. A baby is picked up by Indians after the massacre of a wagon train. Years later, a trio of Indians attract the attention of an outlaw gang by paying for store purchases in gold. The crooks find that the Indians are camping at the ranch of Bill Carr, from which they conclude there must be gold on the ranch. Jerry Carr, son of the ranch owner, becomes heavily in debt to J.F. Henry, the outlaw leader, through a trimming in a crooked card game. Henry then tries to force Carr to sell his ranch unless payment is met. This fails through the intervention of the Indians led by Little Buffalo, the chief's adopted son, who is in reality Jim Little, the white infant picked up years before by the old Chief.
