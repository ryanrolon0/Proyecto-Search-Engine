Veracity

 Veracity personal history, and the history of her father, Kent Heitholt, who was murdered in 2001. The film is a critique to the media and how they treat murder victims and their families, with its constant reporting and questionable ethics. The film is a re-mediation of the story by using the device of a television investigative news program with the director, Kali Heitholt, as the reporter. This way the director was able to become the author of her family's story, while exposing the insensitivity and carelessness of the media. Within the film we also get glimpses of Kali Heitholt's father as she tells the stories of events that touched her deeply as a kid. The film is a critique, homage, an exploration, a catharsis, a portrait and a very human story. Her story... reclaimed.
