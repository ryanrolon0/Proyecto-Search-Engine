The Course of Things

 Ellie likes things a certain way, in a certain order; decisions are to be made and stuck with. Ellie doesn't like her routines ruffled, and usually doesn't have to worry about it because no one ever pays attention to Ellie. Well, at least not until today, her last day of work. She's getting more attention than she's gotten her entire life-from her cubicle neighbor Rochelle, from her boss Max, and especially from Wood, a charming stranger she meets on the elevator. At a time when she's made the biggest decision in her life, the center of attention is the last place Ellie wants to be.
