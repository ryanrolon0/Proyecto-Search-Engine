Three Kings

 Three Kings is a modern documentary that focuses on three triathletes from the same small town training for the triathlon World Championships.  One of the athletes, Bill Chaffey, was training for his first Olympic distance triathlon when he was involved in a horrendous accident that left him a paraplegic.  For four years he trained himself in the disciplines of wheelchair and hand cycle racing to complete his dream of completing a triathlon and representing Australia in a World event while remaining just one of the boys.
