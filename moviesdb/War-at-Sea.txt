War at Sea

 This film covers the Canadian contribution to the war effort at sea during World War II. In the early days, Canada plays a vital role to supply Britain with sea deliveries. However, the job is made all the more difficult with incompetent command, inadequate equipment and training and the fact that the German U-Boats are boldly striking with impunity, even in the St. Lawrence seaway itself!
