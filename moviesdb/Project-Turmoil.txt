Project Turmoil

 "Project Turmoil" is a shocking and brutal account of the notorious "Vox" gang's reign of terror in the Western Cape, South Africa. The gang's murderous spree, which lasted three months is told through a series of no holds-barred interviews with gang members, one of them Gareth Bosman, now serving two life sentences for his part in these vicious crimes.
