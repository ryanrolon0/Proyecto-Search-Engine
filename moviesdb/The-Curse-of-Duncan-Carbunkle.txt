The Curse of Duncan Carbunkle

 His whole life, Duncan Carbunkle believed that he was cursed. Now he's dead. Delores - a young woman who was romantically involved with both Duncan and his best friend Alan - reads aloud a manuscript written by Alan, which was 'To be read at Duncan's funeral'. Alan however, is mysteriously absent. Through the manuscript we learn the story of Duncan and Alan's friendship, Duncan's belief in his curse, and the final cause of Duncan's death. Was Duncan really cursed and destined to die or was it his belief in it that led to his decline?
