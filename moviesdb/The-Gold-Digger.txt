The Gold Digger

 Gina Diggers and her sister Britanny are archaeological explorers, or, some may say, treasure-seekers. Gina takes her adopted baby sister along for protection - Gina's protection, that is, since Britanny is a were-cheetah. On this, their first recorded adventure, they come across a cavern inhabited by the dragon "Dreadwing", where he is hiding the "Time Raft", an ages-old device from the future.
