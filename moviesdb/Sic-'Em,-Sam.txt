Sic 'Em, Sam

 All are dwelling in peace until Prussianism overcomes Liberty. Democracy, undaunted by Propaganda, comes to her aid. Prussianism throws a bomb, and the explosion rings the Liberty Bell. America sends men and fire hoses with the help of the Fourth Liberty Loan, and makes headway against the blaze. The armies rescue Liberty and Prussianism makes his escape, hiding in the Hall of Justice. Democracy discovers Prussianism in hiding and using the fire hoses, washes him down the sewer.
