Private Entrance

 Jeff Landers, an international American lawyer, is flying to Stockholm to meet a client. A Swedish fellow traveller, Carl Stromer, mistakenly lends him a box of matches, which has an important telephone number written on it. Stromer realises his error after the flight has landed and pursues Landers. Meanwhile, the people who were to meet Stromer mistakes him for Landers. Landers meets Kristina, who works for the people meeting Stromer, in a hotel foyer. The police are also after this gang and, after a chase, capture Landers, who escapes to his hotel room, where the bad guys and the cops have a fight and Landers leaves them to it.
