Sure Fire Hit

 Kam is in her thirties and from the suburbs nearing her well earned if somewhat early retirement. She is asked by her boss to train up a replacement before she leaves. Only trouble is, her replacement seems to have an agenda of her own. To make matters worse a Matrix mad ex and his comical friend are hot on their heels but not very good. Warner seems to think he is invisible and his mate would rather hit on the girl and the bottle than a target. Who believes they will come out on top. Sure Fire Hit... a love to kill.
