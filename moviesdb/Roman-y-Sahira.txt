Roman y Sahira

 A modern twist on Romeo and Juliet set in downtown Los Angeles, 'Roman y Sahira' tells the story of two young lovers separated by feuding families, racial tensions, and differing cultures. When their innocent affair is discovered, Roman and Sahira must choose to abandon their love or sacrifice everything. This modern interpretation of the classic Romeo and Juliet story portrays love and family through a Hispanic lens rarely examined in mainstream US entertainment.
