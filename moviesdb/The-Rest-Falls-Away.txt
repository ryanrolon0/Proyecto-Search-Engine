The Rest Falls Away

 The story of Aden Marlow (Ryan Jones), a twenty-something college drop out employed at a gift basket company. Aside from the stresses of work and the constant pestering of his science fiction loving co-worker Morris (Drew Aloe), he is more than lost in the routine of his everyday life, devoid of any real responsibility. His best friend Evan Knox (Joe Gariffo) and the girl he is secretly in love with, Candice Cass (Elena Bossler), are the only things in his life he can count on. But when the choices that Aden makes begin to have unforeseen consequences, his world falls apart around him. He struggles against time to choose a path that will ultimately save or condemn his closest friends, and even himself.
