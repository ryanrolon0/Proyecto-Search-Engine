Talent

 Hollywood talent agent Deborah Klien has had it with show business. In between marriages and the latest in age-defying beauty treatments, Deborah doesn't have time for depression. But before she can drown her sorrows and dreams in a fatal cocktail of Slimfast and Xanax, Deborah rediscovers the ultimate new action star in Dante Picante. In a world of reality shows and movies based on amusement park rides, Dante is the perfect celebrity for the new millennium. And although Dante is driven by vengeful ambition, Deborah finds he's lacking one thing... a pulse.
