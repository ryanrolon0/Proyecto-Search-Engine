Tag-N-Release

 The story of a successful transition from a 'kill' to 100% release marlin fishing tournament. Bob and Carol Butte have been running the Church Mouse Marlin Tournament out of Avalon on Catalina Island for the last 20 years, the first 13 of which, were all about catching the biggest fish. However for various reasons, the 14th year they were forced while 'kicking and screaming' to change the tournament to 100% release. It was only after they realized that the prevailing attitude of their peers was in favor of going to release, that they came around to the idea. It turns out that fishermen do care about conservation, and the objective of 'catching the biggest fish' is easily replaced with 'catching the most fish.'
