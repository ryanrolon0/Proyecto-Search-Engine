Scrum

 SCRUM is the story of two brothers--Simon and Arvin. They're both killers. Simon is a professional. Arvin is insane. Arvin suspects his wife, Emma, is having an affair with a golf pro. Arvin kidnaps and tortures the golf pro, and asks Simon to help him clean up the mess. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, and Simon wonders how much longer he can risk indulging his brother's paranoid delusions.
