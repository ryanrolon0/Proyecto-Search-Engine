The Norwegian Solution

 Norway is per capita one of the world's biggest producers of weapons and ammunition. The Norwegian Solution gives us a rare look into the ammunition's factory Nammo, situated in the idyllic surroundings of Raufoss, in the middle of the country. Norway is per capita one of the world's biggest producers of weapons and ammunition. The Norwegian Solution gives us a rare look into the ammunitions factory Nammo, situated in the idyllic surroundings of Raufoss, in the middle of the country. This is the first time a film team has been allowed to follow the production and testing and given free access to management, engineers and technicians at Nammo. What do the employees think about the products they make? How does the production of highly advanced rockets and ammunition fit with Norway's reputation as a "nation of peace"? The film is not a traditional investigative documentary, but more of an aesthetic and moral exploration where the controversial aspects comes to the surface in subtle ways.
