Toy Room

 In the rock opera Toy Room, Sally Tomato (the individual and her eponymous band) and director Wesley J. Turner bring together an assemblage of talented performers and designers to offer a glimpse into the evocative space in a troubled woman's mind. As we see her life unfold and her childhood slip inexorably away, Sally hurtles into the hectic reality of adult life. We watch as she trades the suffocating bonds of a controlling husband for the wild abandon of a life unleashed. As Sally succeeds in rising above the core mundanity of her life through the use of her imagination, we are all asked to find the Toy Room in our own minds.  Sally Tomato's powerful and intimate delivery makes the tale about the defining moments in her life all the more revealing.
