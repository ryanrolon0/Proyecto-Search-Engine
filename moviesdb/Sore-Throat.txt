Sore Throat

 A wife's lover panics to meet her husband, who just calms him down and reveals his impotency. He attributes it to how he pleasured himself back in his parents' house, when their young maid suddenly crashed in and forced herself on him. It doesn't help when his wife describes a lesbian fantasy. Neither does watching his psychologist with a sex surrogate dressed up as a maid. Actually, the husband is more interested in the psychologist's young seducing receptionist. The husband then conducts casting couches just to see the auditioners touching themselves. One auditioner is accidentally a man. Alas, the final auditioner happens to be his past maid, who quickly continues what she once started. She agrees do it outdoors in front of his family to prove he was cured, but gets a sore throat. She therefore passes her knowledge to a young buxom family friend, who then fails too. The husband then gets the maid to enlist his psychologist's receptionist. The receptionist seduces the maid, and then finally the husband in front of his pleased father in law. The husband gets to re-hire the maid. 'Heather Wayne' (qv) headlines this sometimes foolhardy film yet it lacks nothing when it comes to the hardcore sex portrayed especially between stars 'Paul Thomas (I)' (qv) and the luscious 'Nicole West (I)' (qv) who burn up the celluloid with a nasty episode of unrestrained passion. Young, big breasted 'Christy Canyon' (qv) and willowy 'Summer Rose' (qv) are welcome treats along with 'Jessica Wylde (I)' (qv), 'Robin Cannes' (qv) and more sexy young starlets. Directed by 'Ron Jeremy' (qv), this isn't just another throat movie. This is the throat to end all throats! So don't call a doctor..call 'Heather Wayne' (qv)!
