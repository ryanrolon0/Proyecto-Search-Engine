Scott's Land

 Scott has never had a girlfriend and he hates his job. He sells health insurance to the elderly by telephone. Scott's co-worker and only friend, Helix, is equally pathetic when it comes to women. Life is dismal. When Scott receives a head injury from a rogue hubcap he is diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome, and instantly acquires a Scottish accent. Helix decides to use Scott's 'Super Power' as a ploy to attract women, and Scott and Helix manage to seduce the girls of their dreams. But can Scott find true love while pretending to be someone else?
