The Knight and the Maestro

 Andy and Scott live in two complete different worlds... even as college roommates! Scott is a messy, laid back and constantly playing D&D and having sex with his girlfriend - with the door unlocked. Andy is a quiet, classical music lover who wants everything nice and neat. Girlfriend? He seems to have "lost" her picture, so he draws one, although there's question of whether she really exists.
