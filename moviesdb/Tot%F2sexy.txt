 Two traveling musicians are arrested for trafficking merchandise hidden in their "profession tools", contra-basses. They find themselves in an inhospitable cell with four other inmates, all dressed in vertical striped outfits. When Ninì goes to slip, he has colorful dreams of beautiful women in varied situations, but - as the dream progresses - all stripping of their clothes. Eventually Mimì appears in a butler's outfit to serve Ninì fresh coffee, and that wakes him up to his great annoyance. The two bachelors who do not speak foreign languages, also tell high tales of his musical tours around the globe, and their meetings with foreign women.
