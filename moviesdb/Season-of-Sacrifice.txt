Season of Sacrifice

 Coach Bev Kearney ( 7 NCAA National titles ) and the Texas Lady Longhorn track team for the 2007-8 and 2008-9 seasons, featuring world class runners Alex Anderson and Bianca Knight (who went pro during the making of the film). The film features the 'from the heart' coaching style of Bev Kearney and the many life lessons of the team as they struggle to reach their individual and team goals. Because Bianca Knight went pro during the filming, Season of Sacrifice also features a one of a kind study of the contrasting paths of 2 world class athletes, Alex Anderson and Bianca Knight, as they pursue their goal of going to Bejing for the 2008 Olympic Games.
