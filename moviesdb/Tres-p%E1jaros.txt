Tres pájaros

 Gustavo, well dressed in a Buenos Aires office and gunning for a promotion, gets a briefcase full of cash from his boss to use in shutting down a mine in remote San Juan province. Everything seems to go wrong at the provincial airport; he gets bad directions, leaves cell-phone range, and runs out of gas at a roadhouse near the border where a few drug runners may be waiting for product. He's stuck there for a few days before the gas truck arrives. There he meets Mariel, who's with an older man, one of the drug dealers. His first approach to her to boorish, but something about him attracts her. Will he, his money, or his desire survive?
