Timberjack

 Tim Shipman returns to his father's logging company only to find his father has been killed, money is owed, and Croft Brunner controls the railroad used to haul out the logs. But he learns the Government restriction on his valuable stand of timber has been lifted. Brunner wants that timber and tries to buy him out. Refusing to sell, Tim makes plans to somehow get the timber out.
