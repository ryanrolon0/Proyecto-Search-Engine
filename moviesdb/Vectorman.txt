Vectorman

 It's 2049, the human population of Earth has embarked a migratory voyage to try and colonize other planets. The Earth's cities, forests, icecaps are beginning to foul with toxic sludge! The villainous powerful dictator orbot, known as Warhead is born, and he stands for tyranny, hatred and oppression. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and prepares to execute any humans who dare return to their planet! But only one orbot, by the name of Vectorman, who is cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. He finds chaos and confusion! Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead, and Vectorman will take it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth once again. The future of the human race looks hopeless when maintenance drones accidentally replace the orbot leader's head with a salvaged atomic bomb. All the orbots on Earth are immediately ordered, via television receivers, to stop cleaning up the planet and to start manufacturing weapons for an impending ambush of the returning humans. Only one orbot, a sludge barge pilot who was out of communications range, is unaffected by the evil take-over. You are that pilot the entire human race is for you to destroy the villainous WarHead. You must seek him out by following a trail of television receivers around the Earth, and then confront him in a battle that will decide the fate of the human race and of the planet Earth itself.
