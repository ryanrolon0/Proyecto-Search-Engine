The Problem with Machines that Communicate

 The Problem with Machines that Communicate is a short experimental narrative that examines three lonely characters interacting with technology in a world that otherwise doesn't seem to pay attention to them. Don is a custodian who is never taken seriously, George is a very old man exploring the vivid detail of the world around him, and Hazel is an office worker who is desperate to engage in real conversation. But while each struggle with traditional forms of communication, the inadvertent by-products of their loneliness produces entirely new, abstract forms of communication.
