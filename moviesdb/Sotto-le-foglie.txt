Sotto le foglie

 A boy at his first day of work as a shop assistant perceives that he is being watched through the big shop-window by a girl who's looking at him from inside her car. They start a sort of courting, exchanging glances, making him believe she has some interest in him. And his impression seems to be confirmed when she gets off her car and reaches him, to talk face to face.
