The 'Teddy' Bears

 A combination of the story of Goldlocks and the Three Bears with the true story of how Teddy Roosevelt spared a bear cub after killing its mother while hunting, an event which led to the popularization of the teddy bear. Goldilocks goes to sleep in the bears' home after watching six teddy bears dance and do acrobatics, viewing them through a knothole in the wall. When she is awoken by the returning bear family, they give chase through the woods, but she runs to the aid of the Old Rough Rider, who saves her. An adaptation of the story of Goldilocks and the three bears family leaves their home to take a walk, a young girl walks into their house. After eating the porridge that is cooling on the table, she explores their home. She then falls asleep in Baby Bear's bed. When the Bears return from their walk, they discover the girl, leading to some tumultuous consequences.
