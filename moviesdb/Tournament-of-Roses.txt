Tournament of Roses

 This Cinescope short from the 20th Century-Fox Movietone News, covers the January 1, 1954 "Tournament of Roses" parade, featuring many of the pre-parade activities, leading up to the parade, with the float-theme being "Famous Books in Flowers." The floats, with all colors supplied by flowers, contained humor, music and pretty girls. Parade riders included Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and William Boyd, as his "Hopalong Cassidy" character. The procession winds up at Pasadena's Rose Bowl stadium where the kick-off and part of the football game are also shown. Narrated by Dan Dailey.
