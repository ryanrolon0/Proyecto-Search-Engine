Timboektoe

 Dutch teenagers Kars and Isa are furious when their eternally rowing parents decide to move to France and open a camping site there, which uprooting feels to them like exile in Timbuktu. Luckily Isa meets motherless half-Dutch boy Jules, who becomes their friend while trying to hide his dad is a shameful lush and wheeler-dealer. On top of all the family misery, they get involved in dangerous business.
