The Road to Buyobo

 Catalogs the initiative of some Washington DC suburban moms who, with no prior experience, launched a hands-on micro loan program for impoverished women in rural villages in Uganda. You'll laugh, you'll cry as these intrepid travelers of a certain age return to Buyuobo one year after issuing the first loans. This is an inspiring story of how a little money, a lot of ridiculously unfounded optimism, and a boatload of humor spawned a successful new girl network to fight global poverty.
