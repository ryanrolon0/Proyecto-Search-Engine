The Norman Rockwell Code

 A famous museum... a shocking murder... a distinguished symbologist... an alluring cryptologist... secrets written in code. No, it's not that "other" story. When the curator of The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, is murdered, the police desperately need help with the investigation. Langford Fife, Professor of Symbology at Stockbridge Community College and the son of a certain Deputy Sheriff from Mayberry, North Carolina, is called to the scene. He may have received his degree in symbology through a correspondence course but he's "just as competent as those high-falutin' professors from Harvard with their fancy sheepskins from accredited schools."
