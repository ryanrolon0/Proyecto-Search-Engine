Seven Year Rental

 During the emergence of high-definition media and digital distribution, Video Plus remains a stronghold for late fees, VHS tapes, and an old-school video store experience. Some of the store's employees stay just a few months, avoiding a real job, while others stay for years, avoiding real life. But with its customer base shrinking and the industry changing, John, the store's owner for over twenty years, is doing everything he can to keep his business afloat. It's anybody's guess how long the store and its employees can endure in a place with little to offer for the future but nostalgic feelings for the past.
