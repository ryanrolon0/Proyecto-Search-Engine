War of the Grandmas

 Patty is a no-nonsense tomboy and the queen of her cul-de-sac, where she's reigned for 40 years. But when flirty, sexy Rose, an arch enemy from Patty's past, moves in next door and invades Patty's territory, the queen declares war. And the old gals fight the only way they know how - over a man, Patty's gullible and unsuspecting neighbor, Sterling. Soon, Patty brings her granddaughter into the fray - sweet little Candy - in hopes that Sterling's wealthy son, Lance, will marry Candy and be a father to her unborn child. Not to be outdone, Rose introduces Lance to Ruth, her studious, timid granddaughter, in hopes that Lance will marry Ruth and she will become a mother to Lance's wild child, Dolly.
