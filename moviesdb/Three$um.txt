Three$um

 Prague.Early 1990's Ben and Rachel, the perfect American couple backpack through European and in a greedy effort to heighten their experience, they decide to smuggle drugs across the border into Prague. In a chance encounter with a young and beautiful Amanda "Baby Girl" they find their pawn for the perfect plan. But when Ben's eye moves from Rachel to Amanda, the lines begin to blur in an erotically perverse and mind altering sex triangle. In the vein of "Body Heat", Three$um becomes a manipulative mind game of lust and greed where the pawn captures the King.
