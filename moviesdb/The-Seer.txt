The Seer

 Fourteen year old Tess Hollister is seeing things. Tess is also going blind but having visions of two kidnapped little girls sure to be killed unless she can help save them. Believing she's been given the gift of clairvoyance, Tess rejects the surgery that may save her sight but take away her vision. At what point as a parent do you trust that a child understands the boundaries of their own well being? The Seer is a supernatural drama which examines the balance between protecting a child from the world and allowing them to fulfill their destiny. Even when that destiny means forever altering their life.
