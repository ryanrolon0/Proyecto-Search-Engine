The Crystal Key

 Ozgar, an evil alien, has assaulted your planet and all other planets in the universe. You are assigned to stop him by searching through fields, deserts, caves, spaceships, jungles, and sunken cities looking for clues on how to stop Ozgar and free the people of the universe from destruction. In order to do this, you must look for the Crystal Key and its fins so it will activate portals into unknown worlds.
