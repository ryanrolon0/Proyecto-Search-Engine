The Cross

 In 1968 Arthur Blessitt picked up a cross. Today, forty years later, Arthur has been on every continent and island nation with his twelve-foot cross, encountering people from diverse backgrounds, sharing a message of hope and destiny - the message of the cross. This is the story of his Guinness World Record setting 38,102 mile walk across the globe.
