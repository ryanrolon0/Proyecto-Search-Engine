The Few Doctors

 BBC Executives are gathered to come up with a new concept for Doctor Who on television. After the Children's and Drama departments are excluded the project falls in the hands of the BBC Sports department. The classic science fiction series is changed into a sports grudge match between all the television and movie Doctors against the classic monsters - Cybermen, Daleks, etc.
