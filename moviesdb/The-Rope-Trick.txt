The Rope Trick

 The enigmatic Anto returns to Dublin for a wake and recalls a game he played as a child. As a young boy, Anto enjoyed playing the rope trick game with his friends - pretending to pull an invisible rope across the road and making oncoming cars stop suddenly. But, one day, a car didn't stop and swerved off the road and over a cliff.
