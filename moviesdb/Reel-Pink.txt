Reel Pink

 The Pink Panther goes out fishing and buys 6 worms from a stand. One worm, however, is reluctant to end up as bait, and tries to sabotage the panther's fishing trip by attaching the hook to the motor propeller of a nearby boat, and later cutting off the wire to the motor in the panther's own boat. Finally, the panther has to fight an extremely vicious crab he has fished up from the water.
