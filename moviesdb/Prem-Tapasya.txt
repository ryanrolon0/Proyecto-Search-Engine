The marriage is set to take place within a few days, and preparations are on. Then Devi's brother, Nandlal, comes across a secret about Mohan's life, and puts a stop to this marriage. Devi finds out that her brother is behind this, and tells Mohan, and they plan to get married in secret. That night Mohan does not show up, and Devi is devastated. Fearing that he may have been involved in an accident, she contacts him and finds out that he was out with another woman, a woman named Laila.
