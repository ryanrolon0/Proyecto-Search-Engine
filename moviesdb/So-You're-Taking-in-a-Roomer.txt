So You're Taking in a Roomer

 Joe and Alice decide to rent a room in their house to their neighbor Marvin, who says he is a potato broker. He sets up an office and talks Joe into being his partner in the "potato" business. Joe thinks business is fine, until Marvin skips town and two bookies show up to collect the 'potatoes" from Joe.
