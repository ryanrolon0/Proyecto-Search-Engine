The Clown and His Mysterious Pictures

 Here is a most mystifying scene. The clown appears before a large frame canvas and begins drawing pictures. He first makes the head, arms and bust of a woman, then sketching in her body, he commands her to step down from the frame and in animated form, she obeys. He then draws a picture of an infant, which he as quickly changes into life. The infant begins to cry, when he snatches it away from the picture and places it in the arms of the lady, who flies in great terror.
