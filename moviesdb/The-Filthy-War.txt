The Filthy War

 Dramatic anti-war action-adventure based on a true story about a platoon of young international volunteers under the leadership of war correspondent Eduardo Flores as they take up arms to defend a village in the Yugoslav war. Their enemies are the ethnic-cleansing Serb irregulars led by Arkan, a former international career-criminal. American volunteer Johnny Chicago falls in love with enemy Serb beauty Mira and Eduardo has an affair with intrepid CNN reporter Virginia Blades who attempts to report impartially form both sides of the war before a decisive battle, after which peace returns and a wedding takes place.
