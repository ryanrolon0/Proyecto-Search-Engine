The Two Barks Brothers

 Anthropomorphized dogs play all the parts. E. Barks, local district attorney, is running for mayor as the prohibition candidate. His aged mother tells a sad but hopeful story of how when Barks was a pup, gypsies stole away his brother. The brother, it turns out, is a vagabond with no memory of his life before the gypsies. He arrives in the city and is promptly hired, by Barks' nemesis, the local beer baron and Mob boss, to do some skullduggery. They're setting up Barks to crash and burn. Will treachery triumph, and what of a vigilant mother's memory?
