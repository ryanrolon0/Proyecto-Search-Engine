The Defenders

 John Walker is white supremacist. Now after hearing his speech, four boys go out and kill a young Hispanic. The Prestons are hired to defend one of them, who is the grandson of an old friend of the Prestons. They convince their client to testify against the others, which he does. The Hispanic's brother, a law student, feels that getting the ones who killed his brother is not enough. He wants to file a wrongful death suit against Walker, cause he incited those four men to kill someone who wasn't white and his brother was the first one they came across. While the Prestons agree to do it, they receive harsh criticism that they are attacking the First Ammendment but nevertheless they persevere. A racist provokes four teens into beating a Latino youth to death after one of his fiery speeches on a college campus. The Prestons are first called upon to defend one of the youths who gives testimony against the other three. Then in a turnaround the family of the murdered boy hires the Prestons to try to get a conviction against the racist.
