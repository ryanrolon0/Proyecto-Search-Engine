Taryn Murphy

 Taryn Murphy is the tale of one family's journey through the labyrinth of American health care, special education, and not-for-profit bureaucracy. Whether the journey ends in success, failure, or somewhere in between, this film is about the struggle to preserve dignity and normalcy in the face of much adversity. Taryn Murphy, 17 years old, suffers from a degenerative genetic disorder, Alpha Mannosidosis. Unfortunately, only about one person out of a million suffers from her disease, so the task of raising awareness and money is a difficult one. Now that Paul, her father, has just been laid off, he can devote himself full-time to running the non-profit organization he founded a few years ago, the International Society for Mannosidosis & Related Diseases (ISMRD). This film is about Paul's struggle to succeed raising money before his own money runs out and he has to work again. And it is about one very special teenage girl and her struggle to lead a very normal life.
