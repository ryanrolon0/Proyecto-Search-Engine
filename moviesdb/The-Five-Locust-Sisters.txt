The Five Locust Sisters

 Four of 'The Five Locust Sisters' (qv) are the harmonizing vocalists while the fifth unseen sister is the piano accompanist. Against a simple backdrop, the sisters perform "Get Out and Get Under the Moon", with the simplicity of the setting making the audience focus instead on the harmony of the voices. Moving to a parlor setting with pianist 'Mathilda Locust' (qv) now seen, the harmonizing sisters perform "My Pet".
