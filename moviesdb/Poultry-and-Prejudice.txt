Poultry and Prejudice

 In this social drama/satire, Tessa Darcy, a self-absorbed local beauty queen prepare to enter her chicken, Heidi, into the Birdsville County Fair. The main event, the Poultry Show, draws people from all over the state and the competition is fierce. The Darcy family has produced the prize-winning chicken in the show for the past ten years. Tragedy strikes when Heidi goes missing. Intense accusations and arguments reveal small town prejudices against people with various ethnic backgrounds, social stature (or lack thereof), criminal records and alcoholism. These people are all trying to start fresh but carry a stigma which lends itself to intense finger pointing.
