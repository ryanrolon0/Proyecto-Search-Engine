The Virus

 "The Virus" is about a socially troubled computer programmer (Wayne) that strives to fit into the mainstream culture with his fears. When Wayne goes to a new night club to mingle and look for companionship, he meets Michelle after being shot down by every other woman he comes into contact with. Because Michelle was nice to Wayne, he becomes infatuated and names his computer virus after her. Wayne then releases the computer virus on the city in which he lives to feel vengeful and more superior to those that rejected and ridiculed him throughout his life.
