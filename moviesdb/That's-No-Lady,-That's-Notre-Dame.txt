That's No Lady, That's Notre Dame

 Inspector Clouseau dresses like a woman in an attempt to nab a purse-snatcher at the Paris Hotel D'Hote, but the Surete Commissioner thinks that the disguised Clouseau really is really a woman- Clouseau's sister- and since Clouseau is too embarrassed to identify himself to the Commissioner, he decides to go along with the Commissioner to a restaurant in the Hotel D'Hote. They end up in the Commissioner's own apartment, where the Commissioner's wife is home with a headache!
