The Martini Shot

 The Martini Shot is a mostly improvisational piece about a well known actor that's fallen on hard times. He decides to kill himself at the end of his new film's wrap party in order to preserve his immortality before it's ruined by these lousy pictures he's found himself doing. As the night goes on, he finds both reasons for and against him following through with it. A character piece about Hollywood and the damage done.

Very much in line with the film Leaving Las Vegas but a definite twist at the end.
