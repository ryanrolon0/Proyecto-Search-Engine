Tons of Love

 Two best friends learn that love comes in all different sizes. Alfred 'Al' Johnson and Eric Daniels have been roll dogs since high school. They have everything in common except their taste in women. AL typically falls deep into his pockets for looks and is willing to go the distance to have a "dime piece" on his arm at any cost. Eric on the other hand, loves a woman who can keep him warm beneath her healthy bosom during the winter nights. Big, bold, beautiful and pleasantly plump is the way he prefers to roll, right beneath the rolls. Everything is kosher with their friendship and relationships until ERIC catches his girlfriend cheating and AL convinces him to leave the big girls alone and stick with the "dimes". From the outside looking in, these women look great until they meet their match. As they say - "Hell hath no fury, like a woman scorned". Eric gets involved with a young lady he meets through AL and her baggage quickly unfolds. They soon find out that real beauty goes much deeper than the surface.
