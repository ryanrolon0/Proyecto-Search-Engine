Super Hero

 A young man (Dudley) leads a boring life as a night security guard for a Mail Services warehouse. However, whenever he doses off (which he often does) he becomes the superhero Captain Studly and his everyday life acquaintances join in the fray as their own super alter-egos. But when trouble comes snooping around the warehouse will Dudley bring out the real hero in himself?
