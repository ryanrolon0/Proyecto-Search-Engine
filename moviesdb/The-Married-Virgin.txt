The Married Virgin

 In order to save her wealthy father from disgrace and a possible prison sentence, a daughter agrees to marry the gigolo who's been blackmailing him. What the daughter doesn't know, however, is that the gigolo is actually in cahoots with her father's new wife, a conniving schemer who plans to fleece her new husband for everything he has, then flee the country with her lover.
