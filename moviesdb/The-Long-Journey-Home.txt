The Long Journey Home

 Everyone must see this short non-exploitative documentary about a young woman, Stephanie, facing her past, the incest she suffered at the hands of her stepfather, and the subsequent choices she made when it finally ended. A compassionate portrait of a dysfunctional family and the repercussions that go on and on. Her journey begins in Salt Lake City, Utah and ends back in Nogales, Arizona where she reclaims the little girl she left behind as she disintegrated. Filmed in Utah, Tucson, and Nogales, in an effort to bring understanding to a little discussed taboo. Safe for children and minors.
