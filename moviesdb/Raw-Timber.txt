Raw Timber

 Forest Ranger Tom Corbin('Tom Keene (I)' (qv)) patrols the lumber grant of the McFarland and Williams Lumber Company, party owned by Dale McFarland ('Peggy Keys' (qv)). Tom discovers that Bart Williams ('Robert Fiske (I)' (qv)) is systematically cutting excess timber and falsifying his timber reports to the government. Williams is assisted by "Bull" Riley ('Lee Phelps (I)' (qv)), who, suspecting that Tom has discovered their thievery, gives Tom a beating in an unfair fight. Tom makes his report and government inspector Joe Hanlon ('Ray Bennett (I)' (qv)) is sent out to investigate. Later, Hanlon is killed but Tom gets a confession from Lane, but the sheriff grabs Tom believing he is the killer. Tom escapes from the sheriff and goes after Riley and Williams.
