Timesplitters

 Sergeant Cortez is on a mission back in time to save all of humanity...if time doesn't end up killing him first. Sent to undo the TimeSplitter threat before the threat manifests in the present time, Cortez journeys into six different time periods to track down Jacob Crow, a crazed genius who has carried on his perverted science experiments through two centuries and created the TimeSplitter creatures. In a race against time, it's up to Cortez to stop Crow, or all humanity suffers the consequences.
