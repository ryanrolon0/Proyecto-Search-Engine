The House of God

 Follow a group of interns in a large teaching hospital. When Jo, Chief Resident, has a breakdown the interns are reluctantly placed under the tutelage of the senior resident known as The Fatman. Like "M*A*S*H," "The Hospital" and "St. Elsewhere" (which is drawn from this story) this film is closer to the truth than the public wants to know.
