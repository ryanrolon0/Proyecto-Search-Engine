The Day My Parents Ran Away

 At one time or another, most teenagers have fantasized about being rid of their parents, living in a huge house and having unlimited access to a credit card. All three wishes come true for tough-talking 16-year-old Matt Miller when his fed-up parents leave him to start life anew. Despite the potential for teenage fun, Matt finds that life on his own is more difficult than he anticipated, particularly after the laundry piles up and he grows tired of TV dinners. Suddenly, Matt wants his parents back. However, after Matt tracks his parents down, they deliver a big surprise they're not returning home.
