Strussel Games

 Born into a family known for their wealth, Gilberg Strusselborn always had a problem fitting in. Raised by his father, Heimlich Von Struss, Gilberg lived most of his life in solitude. When he was twenty-five years old, Gilberg's father passed away leaving everything he had to his son. Then out of nowhere, Gilberg vanished. Rumors came and went about potential Gilberg sightings all over the world, but for nearly four years, no one heard anything about him, until one autumn evening, he returned home. For the past five years, no living soul has seen the inside of Von Struss Mansion, which is why upon receiving an invitation for dinner at the estate, Baxter and Ursula Driesdorf could not resist the opportunity. Now on this dark and quiet Sunday evening, the Driesdorfs venture to the historic Von Struss Mansion, but before the night is over, the couple will realize that in his home, Gilberg has bigger plans than just dinner... he wants to play a game.
