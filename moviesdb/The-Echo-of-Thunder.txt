The Echo of Thunder

 Scenic settings in Australia enhance this Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation, a simple yet engaging tale about a teenage girl's adjustment to a new family. Larry, a palm tree farmer in the Australian outback, learns that his ex-wife has died, and that his daughter Lara is coming to live with him. He wants things to work out, but Lara has a rocky time with Larry's new wife, Gladwyn, and their eldest daughter Pearl, as well as Gowd, a school bully. But with the help and love of her father, her new younger sister Opal, and a dog named Thunderwith, Lara just might find the resources to meet all the challenges in her way to make a home with this new family.
