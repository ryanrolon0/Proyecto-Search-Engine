Shewi Hisab

 While traveling through Kurdistan, Flute player Jeladet Kotir is confronted with the reality of war as he is caught in an army ambush. His traveling companions are murdered. But the cruel general Samir Al Babli (an unmentioned personification of Saddam Hussein), saves Jeladet as he has been haunted by these 'white musicians' for years. The beauty of Jeladet's heavenly music finally makes him see the terror of his actions. He surrenders himself to Jeladet and expresses his wish to be tried. Jeladet, raging for what the general has done to his friends and his people, is determined to find justice and takes the general as a prisoner of war. He calls a court together in an old prison of the Saddam regime where ten tortured victims of Samir Al Babli are gathered to try the general. Not the corrupt state this time, but the victims themselves are the judges. Telling their horrible stories they show a different dimension of the destructive war machinery. The trial leads to emotional and fierce discussions between the victims about justice, requital or remission. Is it God who decides about justice or the people? Each of them votes for or against the death penalty. Is the general to survive or to die?
