Rat Race

 Rat Race is a funny colorful flash film about two neighbors, Mr. Blue and Mr. Green. They both receive a text from the Boss to say there's a big announcement in his office today. Both men envisage themselves getting promoted, and their competitive sides kick in. They race to the Bosses office..down the street in their cars and on foot throughout the office building. The climax of the film sees them enter the Bosses office only to discover that they are both being let go. The film was inspired by the current economic climate and the recession.
