Colors, smells, sounds, and tastes will transport us to another reality; to the forest of symbols that is hidden under the facade of rationality. The protagonist experiments with a sensorial and perceptive trip, after which she will know the true essence of everything, including herself. Colors, smells, sounds and tastes will transport us to another reality; more intimate and deeper, almost oneiric, full with life, light and color. And we could glimpse, like the protagonist, the forest of symbols that is hidden under the facade of rationality.
