The History of Denim

 Johnny Roper, a foundry factory worker from the Black County (Mining Region), West Midlands, tells us his story of how he claims he is the creator of Denim! His secret recipe for the great denim material was so true and unique that it was stolen, and for many years too. Now, the recipe has been re-captured and improved by Johnny's ancestor, Luke Roper, claiming back what is rightfully his, giving the grafters of the world their well deserved luxury back in life, a cool pair of jeans.
