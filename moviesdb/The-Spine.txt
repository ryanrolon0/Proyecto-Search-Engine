The Spine

 A group therapy session for couples begins. The therapist asks Dan, a small, shrunken man, to comment. Dan is interrupted by Mary, his huge wife, who complains about Dan and scolds him. Her harangue follows them home. He reaches over to touch her hand; he calls her his songbird. She melts - or at least the air leaves her. Six months later, Dan returns to the group alone; he's looking well. Lights shine from him. He extends a kindness to Angela. What is Dan's story?
