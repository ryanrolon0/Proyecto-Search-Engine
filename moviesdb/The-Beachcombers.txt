The Beachcombers

 Divided by the stunning and vast expanse of water that is London's River Thames, a young pair of shy beachcombers are united by their fixation with metal detecting in search of rare antiquities. They soon strike up a sweet and unique connection across the water and build up a language of signs and signals with which they are able communicate daily, but when one of the pair stumbles across a chance discovery, it finally gives them the ideal opportunity to cross over the river. The Beachcombers is a quirky, heart-warming tale of friendship and love, set against the backdrop of modern day London.
