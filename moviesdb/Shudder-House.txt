Shudder House

 On a rural estate in 1951, a boy named Robby trudges through a meaningless childhood. Training on classical piano is his only chore dictated by unloving parents. But when a Southern farmhand named Emma returns to the farm with a guitar in hand, Robby faces his only opportunity to grow and feel beyond his boyish blues.
