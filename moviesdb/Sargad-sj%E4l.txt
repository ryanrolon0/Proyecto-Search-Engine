Sargad själ

 A prostituted woman walks down a city street in darkness. To avoid the eyes of the "real people" she turns her face to the ground, but it doesn't offer any shelter from the hard words. The woman who can't bare very much more of this life of hers sits down on a stairway when help suddenly arrives in an unexpected way.
