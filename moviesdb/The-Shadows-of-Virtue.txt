The Shadows of Virtue

 An introspective look at the actions God's love compels us to take in response to the crisis of global poverty. What are the complexities and pitfalls of learning how to love across cultural, economic, political, religious and racial barriers? How do we honor and value those in need without objectifying them? Can we avoid the temptation to fixate upon a single virtue rather than love itself? The lessons to be learned here are applicable to all - not just in the context of what is happening in Tanzania, but what is happening in our communities, our homes and our hearts. The Shadows of Virtue illuminates this fundamental call to love others as an end unto itself. That people are an end unto themselves.
