Susanne im Bade

 An art instructor (Hans Schlenck) is so enthralled when he sees a student (Manja Behrens) in a bathing suit that he, for his own artistic gratification, paints her as a nude gazing at the sea. His pupils see the painting and enter it in an art exhibit. The young man the student is engaged to eyes her alledged posing with indignation, and breaks the engagement.
