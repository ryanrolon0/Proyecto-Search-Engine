The Gatewood Movie

 The Gatewood Movie covers the life and times of marijuana activist, defense attorney, author, and perennial political candidate Gatewood Galbraith. The documentary is both a biography of Galbraith's wild life and an account of his most recent run for governor in 2007. The controversial attorney talks about his battles with childhood illness, his activism for marijuana and industrial hemp, and the hardships he has had to overcome to get where he is today. Author of The Last Free Man in America, an autobiography of his remarkable life, Galbraith pulls no punches. On the campaign trail he confronts the rampant corruption in state politics today. Will he become governor of Kentucky? That is the goal of "the last free man in America." Shot for less than $500 by a local filmmaker, the movie offers an inside look at grassroots politics, and the hopes of the common people of Kentucky.
