Stealing Suburbia

 STEALING SUBURBIA is inspired by the true story of Colton Harris-Moore, "America's Most Wanted Teen Bandit." Tired of his abusive stepfather and the shoddy trailer he calls home, Malcolm moves into the wilderness, and takes his future into his own hands. Treating suburbia like it's the Wild West, Malcolm robs grocery stores and residential homes, steals cars, speedboats, and soon graduates to private airplanes, all before his 18th birthday. It's a film of trial and tribulation, love and despair, and ultimately a tale of need - how far will he go to achieve the seemingly attainable, and fulfill his childhood dreams of becoming a pilot?
