The Chess Shop

 The old Chinese proverb goes 'Life is like a game of Chess, changing with each move.' And at The Chess Shop in the West Village of New York City, nothing could be truer. Day in and day out there are new players and new matches, new characters and new stories. Players of all ages, races, and nationalities come together at The Chess Shop and at the end of everyday everyone is part of the same family, The Chess Shop family.
