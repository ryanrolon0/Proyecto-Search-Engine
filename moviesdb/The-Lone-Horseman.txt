The Lone Horseman

 Rancher Jack Gardner is ambushed and awakens in a hospital and finds that his ranch has been illegally sold out from under him to an old lady and her niece Peggy. Believing the new owner to be a man, because she is named Pat, Jack threatens many things, but when he meets "the nice old lady" and realizes she too is a victim, he takes another path to right both wrongs. Meanwhile, the swindler has snooped around and discovered ore on the Gardner ranch, and is now trying to buy back what wasn't his to begin with.
