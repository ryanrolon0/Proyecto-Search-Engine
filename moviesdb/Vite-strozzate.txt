Vite strozzate

 Francesco is an active entrepreneur in the building industry. His firm is near to collapse if it won't win a deal to build a new school complex. It needs at least 60 Mn Lire (30k Euro) to participate to the deal, but all the banks refuse to lend the money it needs. A corrupted bank employee introduces Francesco to Claudio, apparently an assistant of Sergio, Francesco's old school friend. Sergio is an accountant available to lend Francesco the money he needs. Francesco wins the deal. But soon he will discover Claudio isn't what he says he is. At the end the cost to pay will be too high and will make his family running high risks.
