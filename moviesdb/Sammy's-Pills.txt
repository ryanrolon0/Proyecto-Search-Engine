Sammy's Pills

 With a zany cast of characters, a little romance, and certainly lots of shenanigans, Sammy's Pills delivers a refreshingly new spin on classic filmmaking. Made to parody the silent 'OUR GANG' series, it explores the underworld of childlike adults, most of whom escape themselves by drugs provided by a masked control freak, a bully who uses his medications to manipulate his followers, and when the beautiful town sweetheart rejects him for another his makeshift world begins to crumble as he struggles to maintain his power. This is the story of modern day rascals, a band of underworld misfits with addictions to feed.
