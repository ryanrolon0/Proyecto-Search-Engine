Timestretched

 Timestretched, a scientific future fiction. In a future society the use of hibernation has become widespread in all walks and spheres of life. The technology is such that it allows users to be frozen for seconds, months or years, be readily reanimated without physical side effects. The universal use of the system creates a new social dynamic. The story unfolds through 15 scenes in which characters from different environments and backgrounds reveal aspects of this new situation, the benefits and inevitable problems entailed within. The fact of being time easy to accumulate and death, if not abolished then indefinitely postponed, transforms human's whole economic, social and cultural structure.
