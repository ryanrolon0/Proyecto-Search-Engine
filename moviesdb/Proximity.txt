Proximity

 Jack's girlfriend of four years, Alyssa, has just accepted a scholarship to USC and will be leaving Arizona soon. Jack feels that his choices are limited to going along with her to L.A and ending his career, or ending their relationship. In a state of indecision and confusion, Jack storms off to take a drive and think, but a late night car crash changes everything. Trapped within the shadows of his own mind, Jack will have to face his fears or die. Only by finding the love in his life and dwelling within those moments can he save himself. Only Jack can determine his own Proximity to life or death.
