R2PC

 An insightful comedy with roots in the great mockumentary movement of the 1980s, the film follows an impassioned and misguided wannabe filmmaker, John Viener (a comedian playing himself), who throws everything away to make "a film that's gonna win Sundance." Seeking advice from friends, industry veterans and technicians, his quest becomes a guided tour of what to do, and, more pointedly, what not to do.
