Stealing Baby Jesus

 It is the end of the century, December 1999 and faith takes many forms as numerous Baby Jesuses are being 'stolen' from nativity scenes throughout the city of Denver. Many claim a miracle. Others, outright theft. As everyone else prepares to deal with the holidays and Y2K, Warren John, late-night cynic of the airwaves announces the rash of baby-nappings is all PR and puts himself atop a billboard, there to stay until the culprit is found out. National attention follows and the city is transfixed. Churches hire security guards to protect the valuable nativity character but to no avail. Within the two-week Holiday period, over 25 Baby Jesuses disappear into thin air. As a nasty blizzard threatens Warren John..s stunt, the seemingly disconnected stories of his listeners culminate to reveal the faith or felony of Stealing Baby Jesus, a classic Holiday story for the 21st century.
