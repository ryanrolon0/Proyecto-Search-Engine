Smokes & Ears

 For over 70 years, Jackson, Mississippi's, Big Apple Inn has served up smoked sausage and pig ear sandwiches known simply as 'smokes & ears'. These sandwiches are small in size, but they're big on flavor and they've kept this neighborhood fixture open and thriving while most of the other businesses on Jackson's historic Farish Street have disappeared. Through the story of this tiny sandwich shop we encounter the history of the African-American experience in Jackson, Mississippi, we hear the stories of its regulars which included civil rights leader Medgar Evers and blues legend Sonny Boy Williamson II, and we are treated to performances from current regulars, R&B stars Jesse Robinson and Bobby Rush.
