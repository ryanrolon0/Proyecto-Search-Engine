Take, Me, There

 Samantha, a self-centered 20 year old, meets a Japanese man Take, after having a fight with her boyfriend. Take is a silent/subtle man who keeps a smile on his face. As Samantha keeps seeing Take repetitively, her interest towards him begins to grow bigger and bigger. At the same time, she starts to wonder why Take leaves a smile on his face. Could he be hiding something underneath that smile? When Take receives a phone call, he tells Samantha that he has to go, and not sure when he will be back. While left alone, Samantha realizes how important the relationship with Take is, how she has changed from the way she used to be. Samantha feels deep emptiness without Take.
