Ruth Ellis

 Documentary on Ruth Ellis, a Welsh-born model and actress, who was the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom. She went to the gallows of London's Holloway prison on July 13, 1955, for the gunshot murder of her lover, David Blakely, on Easter Sunday, April 10, of that same year. She was 28 at the time and was hanged, despite a 50,000-signature petition from the British public for leniency.
