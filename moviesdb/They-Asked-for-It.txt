They Asked for It

 Three teenage youths and a young girl, leave college and take over a small town newspaper. They get more than they bargained for when they print that the death of the town sot was murder, not an accident as the police indicated. Three college grads---each about 15 years past their teenage years and not portrayed as such in this film---are trying to make a living pursuing the professions they received their degrees in a few years prior to the film's opening. Steve Lewis, is the owner-editor of a small town newspaper and is on the brink of bankruptcy. Two friends he went to college with---many years ago, when they were teen-agers---Howard Adams, a struggling attorney, and Dr. Peter Starks, have been persuaded to open offices in the village. Steve's sweetheart, Mary Lou Carroll, is working as a reporter on Steve's "Clarion-Bee" newspaper. When Ted Herkimer, a penniless farmer, dies, Steve, in order to increase his newspaper's circulation, creates a story hinting at murder, while Ames and Sparks plant phony evidence. The local coroner soon refutes the claim and refutes the evidence, with all three men ---long past being teenagers---becoming the laughing stock of the town. Then, Steve receives a call from Marty Collins, who says his sweetheart, Molly Herkmiker, daughter of the dead man, did indeed kill her father. She didn't, but the non-teenage Steve, his non-teen-age friends and his non-teenage girlfriend set out to find the guilty party.
