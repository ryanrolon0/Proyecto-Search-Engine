The Little Maestro

 A silent, little man carrying a violin case wanders into the kitchen of a swanky nightclub looking for a meal. The chef takes pity on him and convinces the nightclub's owner that the man is actually a world-famous artist. The owner insists that the man perform for his customers. That's when the fun begins.
