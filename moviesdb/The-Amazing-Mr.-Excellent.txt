The Amazing Mr. Excellent

 After being shocked unconscious by his toaster, family man, Duncan Quinn, wakes up believing he has received a divine calling to become a caped crime-fighting super-hero. Finding no crime in his white suburban neighborhood, Duncan ventures into a ghetto of Oakland to wipe out crime. Unwelcome and unfamiliar with the modern inner city, Duncan unwittingly invites crime upon himself and ignites danger and incites hilarity at every turn.
