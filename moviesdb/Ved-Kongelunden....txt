Ved Kongelunden...

 The inhabitants of a summer cottage community near Copenhagen enjoy life. Next-door neighbours Rasmussen and Olsen have their fights and complaints, but never more than can be handled with a bottle of beer and a song. Their respective son and daughter are sweethearts, but hit a bump in the road due to a misunderstanding. Bachelors Svendsen and Iversen operate a tram together by day and share a defunct tramcar for a house. They all share a summer abound with comedic mishaps and joyful occasions.
