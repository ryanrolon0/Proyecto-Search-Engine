They Meet Again

 In the sixth entry of this series, Dr. Paul Christian is giving a party for Janie Webster, a motherless little girl of nine, with a fine singing voice. But, as her father, Bob Webster, is about to leave the bank where he works to go to the celebration, a shortage is found in his books. for which he is held responsible, jailed, and subsequently, in a court trial is found guilty. Janie is not told that her father is going to prison, but her South Park schoolmates quickly make sure she is informed and brought up to date, and she becomes very ill. Dr. Christian gets his friends and household together, especially Mr. Hastings, his housekeeper who solves all problems by astrology, and, based on a hunch by Dr. Christian, who is convinced Bob is not guilty, they decide to 'cherchez la femme" (not easy to do with a Swedish accent) and prove Bob's innocence. And do so just in time to watch Janie win the state-wide singing contest. In this last entry in the "Dr. Christian" series, the good doctor is determined to free a young man from prison. The man was sent there for embezzlement, but Dr. Christian doesn't believe he embezzled the money, and sets out to find the real culprit.
