Promise Her Anything

 A young lady has been widowed and left with a baby son to bring up alone. She decides that the baby needs a father figure and decides to marry a psychologist. She hides her son with an upstairs neighbour until she has got her man. Harley Rummel is an aspiring filmmaker, who, based on the financing from his sole backer Angelo Carelli, is currently reduced to making mail order adult films in his apartment. Harley and Angelo are often at odds with each other over their artistic differences. Widowed Michele O'Brien moves in next door to Harley, she who is looking primarily for a father for her infant son, John Thomas. Her primary candidate is her boss, renowned child psychologist Dr. Philip Brock, named the sixth most eligible bachelor in the country. Her pursuit of Philip is despite him not wanting any children of his own and despite not really loving him as a man. So she hides the fact of being a mother from him. Conversely, Philip is attracted to Michele, not knowing she has an infant son. Harley is also attracted to Michele, who doesn't know what kind of films Harley makes. Regardless, Michele doesn't consider Harley to be father material despite she also being attracted to him. Harley also learns to love John Thomas, initially for what John Thomas can add to the artistic vision of his movies. Harley does whatever he can to get both Michele and John Thomas, which involves supporting her in her pursuit of Philip. Complications ensue when Philip learns of John Thomas, who he believes is Harley's genius progeny.
