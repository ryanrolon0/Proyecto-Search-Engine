The Mirror in My Mind

 We live in a media saturated world where we are constantly bombarded by images of supposedly "beautiful people."

How can the rest of us measure up to these standards? And why should we? The mirror in My Mind damages these cultural forces can do to a young person's developing sense of self-worth.
