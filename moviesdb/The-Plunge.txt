The Plunge

 The Plunge is a film about the lengths we go to for love. Joe is a mild-mannered fellow deeply in love. His girlfriend is Michelle, a risk-taking, thrill seeking kind of girl. Joe knows it's time to pop the question, but he wants to do it in a way that will knock Michelle's socks off. Joe's solution is a skydiving adventure with a daring mid-air proposal. He soon learns that this will not be as simple as he had hoped.
