The Death of Alice Blue

 Shy Alice Blue is the new creative intern at Raven Advertising. Unfortunately for her the place is run by vampires. A group of eccentrics enlist her aid in thwarting their nefarious schemes but there's a complication. There's the possibility that she herself may be genetically predisposed to being the greatest vampire ever, and the only one who can save the dying breed. Alice is forced to confront herself and make a stand, whatever the outcome.
