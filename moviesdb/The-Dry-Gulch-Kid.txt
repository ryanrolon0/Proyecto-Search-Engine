The Dry Gulch Kid

 "The Dry Gulch Kid," is an adventure comedy that takes a fantastic journey along a winding trail of daring adventures and near escapes. Our heroes - Lester Downs and Bobby Ryder - right wrongs, save damsels in distress and ride into history; but keeping a low profile doesn't seem to fit into their plans.
