The DC Five Memorial Film

 THE DC FIVE MEMORIAL FILM is structured in five sections writhing in ecstasy in a deserted house in Massachusetts; rephotographed home movies of my childhood in 1953 Connecticut; footage shot at my farm in upstate New York in the summer of 1969, as some friends of mine share cigarettes in the woods; a party at the Sanctuary Discotheque in the summer of 1969, photographed using the same reel of color film reloaded into the camera at least seven or eight times; and finally the apotheosis of the work, in which a group of young women, arms linked, walk through the Port Authority Bus Terminal in the dead of night.
