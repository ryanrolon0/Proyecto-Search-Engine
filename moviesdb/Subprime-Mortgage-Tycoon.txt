Subprime Mortgage Tycoon

 The year is 2006 and the subprime mortgage bubble is in full boom. Make as many unqualified housing loans as possible, the repackage into mortgage based securities to sell to investors. Be careful though, the SEC is watching. If you get investigated, use your political connections to avoid trouble. Make as much money as you can before the government bailout of 2008.
