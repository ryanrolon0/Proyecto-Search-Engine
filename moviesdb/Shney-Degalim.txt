 The movie 'Two Flags', set in the time of WW2, tells in a voice that speaks to children and adults, the story of a small group of underdog kids fighting to save their home from their local bully. This kid's fight turns into full blown war led by the underdog's leader, Yashek, an immigrant boy from Poland who escaped Nazi Europe looking for a better life in Israel.
