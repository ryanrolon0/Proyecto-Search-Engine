Tweet Dreams

 Warners' "economy cartoon," repackaging footage from earlier Tweety and Sylvester chases with new footage. In this one, Sylvester tells a psychiatrist of his frustration at not being able to catch Tweety, his repeated failures illustrated through past cartoons featuring the canary and puddy tat. Apparently, Sylvester's sob story puts the doctor to sleep, and upon the doctor's waking up, realizes he's got to fly (literally, by flapping his arms) to Detroit. Sylvester jumps out the window to fly after the psychiatrist.
