 Kenny, Stef and Zirafa are friends and as the majority of young people, they also face many teenage problems. Because they do not know what to do in their life and because of multiple distresses, particularly social, they are engaged in robbing. But Kenny wants to change his life for the better and stop this activity. Despite his objections, Stef finds a way to convince him to do their last robbery. They go and try to execute the robbery, but not all goes according to plan. It appears that their friendship is not as strong as they thought. In the end the desire to be wealthy prevails.
