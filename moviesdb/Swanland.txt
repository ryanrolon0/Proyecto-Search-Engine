Swanland

 The world is coming to an end. Most have either died or deserted their homes. Casey and Lissa, a young couple in a strained relationship, has decided to live out their last days in an empty town. Their haven is disrupted when an unpredictable group of survivors joins them. Among these survivors is Aaron, Lissa's former lover, who is still very much in love with her. Accompanied by both family and friends, Aaron begins to shake the foundations of Casey and Lissa's relationship even more, leaving them on opposite sides. As Aaron tests the couple, the rest of his group are left to make their own decisions about faith and morality.
