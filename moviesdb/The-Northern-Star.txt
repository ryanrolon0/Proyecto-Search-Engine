The Northern Star

 On assignment to interview its most reclusive leader, Sharon discovers a shattering secret when something unexpected happens during the interview. As her concepts of truth and lie, friends and foes get blurred, she finds a most unlikely ally in the very heart of the regime she has to escape from. A strange set of events take her from the reclusive state to Beijing, Washington, D.C., New York and finally to Miami, during which she comes to terms with the hypocrisy and indifference surrounding human relationships across and at all levels. According to writer/director Uris, "The Northern Star is not an action feature but rather a dreamlike venture, in the tension-drama genre, into the coldness of the world we have to live in and find our own lighthouses."
