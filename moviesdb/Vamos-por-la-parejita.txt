Vamos por la parejita

 Antonio Garisa is Juan Fernández Arriaga, a typicall spanish man fifty years ago. He's married and has five girls, but he is unhappy because all he wanted was a boy (in spanish argot, "ir por la parejita" means trying to have a couple of children, girl and boy). He only has women and they have only girls. During the film he prays, he tries to have a boy to give him his surname "Fernández". Garisa is one of the best actors of Spanish Comedy, maybe too understimate because the kind of cinema made in Spain during Franco's government.
