The Commissioner

 A member of the British Government is sent to Brussels to become British Commissioner to the European Community. He is made aware of a web of political and industrial corruption through a series of anonymous letters. Despite his own history of political expediency, the Commissioner rises to the moral challenge and faces off with the evil forces responsible.
