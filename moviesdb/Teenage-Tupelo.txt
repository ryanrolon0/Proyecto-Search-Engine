Teenage Tupelo

 In Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1962, a poor, young, single mother is impregnated by a womanizing has-been singer. Her mother tries to force her to give the child away but our heroine isn't sure. As she tries to solve her problems she receives assistance from unlikely quarters and the feminist/nudist/stripper/adult film star they idolize.
