Unsafe and Seine

 Inspector Clouseau and Sergeant Deux-Deux are assigned by the Surete Commissioner to search for a secret agent, who supposedly has information that Clouseau's life is in danger. The search takes Clouseau and Deux-Deux through a series of disasters in Paris, London, Switzerland, Venice, and the jungles of Africa. When they meet the agent, they discover he is actually an insurance agent, who arranged all the disasters they've been through to show the everyday hazards of police work and persuade Clouseau to purchase an insurance policy!
