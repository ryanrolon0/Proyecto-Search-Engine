Water

 Water is more than just a simple mixture of hydrogen and oxygen molecules, it is the source of all life. Human beings can go on for days, even weeks, without food but can die in a matter of days without water. Although water is crucial to survival, it is potentially destructive. There have been countless stories of people drowning and entire towns being engulfed in water. Through color, symbolism, and imagery, water is depicted as something necessary yet potentially detrimental to life.
