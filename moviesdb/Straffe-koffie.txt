Together they spend a week on the isle of Tenerife. They fall in love and have a wonderful time together. With a little video camera they film the highlights of their trip for the television audience at home.

Meanwhile Tamara sneaks off. The inspectors find a second packet of 'white coffee' in the briefcase. Philip's got a hard time. The interrogation is tough and merciless. Philip is losing it...
