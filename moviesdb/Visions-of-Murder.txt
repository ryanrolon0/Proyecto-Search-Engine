Visions of Murder

 Jesse Newman is an ambitious psychologist in a therapy center. One day Gloria Hager appears in her office and starts telling about her husband, who beats her. But suddenly she runs out... When Jesse starts having visions of Gloria shortly after, she at first believes it's due to stress. But when she seems to witness Gloria's husband Truman dump her body into the sea, she reports to the police -- and gets under suspect herself. The Admiral's daughter turns out to be the stolen baby of the therapist, and the psychic connection to her true birth mother leads to startling visual hallucinations and revelations.
