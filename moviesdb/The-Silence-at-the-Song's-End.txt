The Silence at the Song's End

 Nicholas Heiney fought inner demons throughout his whole life, escaping to literature and the sea. Though he kept his mental state hidden from the world, he constantly recorded his thoughts and fears through poetry. On June 2006 he took his own life. This is an imagined account of his dreams and nightmares, inspired by the book 'The Silence at the Song's End', edited by his mother Libby Purves and containing his poems and journal entries.
