 A spoof documentary following sketch group 'The Intimate Strangers' during their world tour of Brighton. However, all goes awry when James quits days before the big show. With most of Brighton out to get him, can Matt save the day before it's too late or is this both the beginning and the end of The Intimate Strangers?
