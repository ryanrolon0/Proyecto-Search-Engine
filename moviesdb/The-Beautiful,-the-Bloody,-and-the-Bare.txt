The Beautiful, the Bloody, and the Bare

 An artist and his wife hold art classes using nude models. Their photographer friend Pete returns from two years in Europe, and they try to convince him he has a promising career in nude photography. He eventually agrees to try it, but finds that the sight of red hair or red nail polish triggers unhealthy impulses, to the detriment of some of his models.
