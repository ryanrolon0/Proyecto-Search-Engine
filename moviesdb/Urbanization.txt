Urbanization

 As a man walks through downtown, he finds himself trapped by the concrete cage that is his city. He finds himself being assaulted by images and ideas of URBANIZATION; the byproduct of creating and building civilization, the dark side to urban conformity, and mankind at its worse. Feeling trapped, he escapes to a place where he finds safety, at least for the moment.
