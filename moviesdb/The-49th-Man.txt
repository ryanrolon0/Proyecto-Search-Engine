The 49th Man

 U.S.Security Investigation Division chief Paul Reagan ('Richard Denning (I)' (qv)) assigns John Williams ('John Ireland (I)' (qv)) to hunt down a subversive group that has been smuggling A-bomb parts into the United States in specially designed cases. Williams traces the ring to Marseilles, France, where he meets Margo Wayne ('Suzanne Dalbert' (qv)) at a waterfront cafE and discovers she is part of the plot. When recalled by Regan, Williams is informed that he has been engaged in a "war games" security check to test America's atomic defense, but he proves to Regan that enemy agents are actually using the "war games" as a front to smuggle an A-bomb into the country.
