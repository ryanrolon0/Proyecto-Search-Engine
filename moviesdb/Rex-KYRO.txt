Rex KYRO

 Rex Kyro, heir to the Galactic throne, doesn't have big shoes to fill as his father, King Dirk, who's policy of 'fun first', has pushed the galaxy into exciting, yet uncertain times. Rex, the eldest and wisest of King Dirk's sons is about to pay for his fathers failed policies. The Farrah who plot to put an end to King Dirk's rule, have sent out their top agent, Elentis, to take care of business.
