Red Poet

 Poet Jack Hirshman loses his prestigious position as a professor at University of California due to his anti-war activitism. What follows is a precipitous fall from grace and a descent into homelessness marred by personal loss and tragedy. Nonetheless, he remains true to his artistic vision and builds an international following through his work. In 2006, he is named Poet Laureate in his beloved home city, San Francisco. RED POET tells the timeless story of a man's personal journey and redemption through the uncompromising pursuit of his poetry and art.
