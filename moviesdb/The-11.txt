The 11

 Since his girlfriend left him, Kurt's patience for his job at the movie theater has all but disappeared. After being sentenced by his boss Richard to work in the ticket booth, Kurt meets Rosey, a young woman waiting outside the theater. With assistance from his inept co-worker, Jake, Kurt has to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice his job to speak to a girl he doesn't know.
