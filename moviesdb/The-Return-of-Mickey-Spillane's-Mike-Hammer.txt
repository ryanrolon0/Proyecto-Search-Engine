The Return of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer

 A kidnapping in Central Park followed by a near-kidnapping in Mike Hammer's neighborhood from a movie set brings Hammer into the fray. Hired to protect the young girl who was the near victim, Hammer follows the film crew to Hollywood. Once there, the girl is kidnapped and Hammer sets off in a mad search for her. In route he is led into an underground led by killers, gamblers, and a grim reminder of the Vietnam War.
