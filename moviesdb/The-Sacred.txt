The Sacred

 Fresh off the success of her first horror novel, Jessie is revered by the literally world as the next Stephan King. While her editor anxiously awaits her follow up novel, she is suffering from major writer's block. Out of fear of becoming a one-hit novelist, Jessie ventures to her deceased aunt's cabin in the woods to find inspiration for her new book. Upon her arrival, she is greeted with subtle suspicion amongst the townspeople, namely her aunt's caretaker, George, whose history here is shrouded in secrecy. Having not visited in many years, Jessie has no memory of her childhood summers at the cabin or her time spent in the surrounding woods. But when darkness falls on Jessie's first night alone, her memories begin to awaken. A dark presence resides here. One that seems to be watching Jessie every second. One that she has always been afraid of. Now, with the help of Leah, a mysterious young girl, Jessie sets out to uncover the truth about her past that lies buried within the cabin walls. Her quest leads her to Ms. Jenson, an old shopkeeper on the outskirts of town, whose knowledge of an ancient doll found in the cabin leads Jessie one step closer to the darkness that awaits her. What follows is a series of erotic, bizarre and terrifying events that force Jessie to question her own reality. Driven to the point of insanity, she is finally rescued by her boyfriend, Brian, and two other friends who come to keep her company. But their visit only further infuriates the unseen entity that clearly wants Jessie to itself. In a gruesome turn of events, members of the group are mutilated one-by-one, leading Jessie to a shocking revelation about her childhood here, and forcing her to confront an evil incarnate that has long awaited her arrival.
