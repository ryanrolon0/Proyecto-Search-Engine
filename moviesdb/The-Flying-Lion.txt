The Flying Lion

 A handheld camera follows a tiny dandelion seed as it floats through an urban landscape like a microscopic paratrooper, encountering near misses and breathtaking moments along the way, with only the spirited winds controlling it. After a long journey, it lands on a patch of earth of its own, somewhere far away but not too different from where it began. The Flying Lion was shot around Vancouver on a small HD camera over the course of two months, shooting for an hour or so on sunny evenings. Later the footage was assembled, tracked, and the seeds were animated into the backgrounds. With a musical score composed by Dave Genn, the result is a gentle, nonverbal mediation on perspective, nature and life. One sunny summer day in Vancouver, British Columbia, a dandelion plant at the side of a busy street has gone to seed. A gust of wind blows the flower seed head apart. One of those seeds floats through the busy city, encountering along its way open fields, buildings, people and traffic before it settles in its new home at the side of the road, just like its mother plant, to start life anew.
