Tere Mere Sapne

 Balu (Arshad Warsi) is a slick but flat-broke cabdriver whose life is changed forever when he picks up an unhappy young rich man named Rahul (Chandrachur Singh) at the airport one day. Bored with his privileged but empty life, Rahul convinces Balu to switch places with him. Rahul moves into Balu's home, where he falls hard for Balu's sister, Parvati (Priya Gill). Meanwhile, Balu realizes that the manager of Rahul's successful business has been cheating him for years--and that he has an extremely attractive daughter named Pooja (Simran). P.V. Shastri lives in a small town in Southern India with his wife, son, Ballu, and daughter, Paro. He finds out that Paro is in love with a young man named Rahul Mehta, and asks her to bring him home to meet his family. Rahul does come to meet him, but shocks the family by telling them that he is not a Hindu but a Christian - as his deceased mother and father were Hindu and Christian respectively. Shastri refuses to permit him to marry Paro, but when Paro insists that she will marry Rahul and no one else, he consults various pundits, and puts forth various conditions on Rahul, one of them being that he change his religion to Hinduism, to which Rahul agrees. He also asks Rahul to look for a suitable job, as the marriage is to take place within a month. Thrilled, Rahul goes around looking for a job. What Shastri does not know is that Rahul is the only heir of multi-millionaire business tycoon Shambunath Mehta, who will never permit Rahul to marry into a poor family such as that of Shastri. Watch how events unfold, and why Rahul chose to hide his grandfather and his wealthy background from the Shastri family.
