Torture Me No More

 Who killed the brother of Sal? The neighbors think it's Sal himself, who's just been released from prison and returned home to reunite with his sibling. But Sal was at the pizzeria picking up an order at the time of the murder. Two cops are on Sal's case, determined to send him back to jail, so he takes it upon himself to discover the true killer -- which leads him to explore a sadomasochistic world.
