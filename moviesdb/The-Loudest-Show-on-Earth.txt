The Loudest Show on Earth

 In the streets of Notting Hill, London, two hundred drummers stand in formation, drums hooked to their hips, mallets poised in expectation, all eyes focused on the man in front of the band. At his sign, the drumming begins, a thunderous rhythmic sound that has spectators dancing in seconds. The band members come from ten different countries and speak at least five different languages, but are all united in one universal language The Loudest Show On Earth will follow the band as they prepare for Carnaval in Brazil. We will see Brazil through the eyes of a band member traveling to the country for the first time, and we'll get a glimpse of the social project that Batala supports in Salvador.
