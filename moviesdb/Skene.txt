Skene

 Ella, a girl from the province, starts her freshman year at the Helsinki Business School. The capital's party scene introduces her to ecstasy, and together with her new friend Silja and boyfriend Jokke she can't help finding it an easy and lucrative business opportunity. The three soon develop an addiction not so much to the drug but to all the good things that the money can buy. But before long, reality bites back.
