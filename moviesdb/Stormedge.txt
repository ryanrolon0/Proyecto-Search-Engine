Stormedge

 Earth's entire population has been nearly wiped out by a ruthless alien destroyer from a far away galaxy, millions of light years from our own. After the violent annihilation at the hands of his Army of Darkness, a mere handful of survivors are left on our dying and desolate planet. One survivor, Dash, heir to a once royal lineage of Earth's elite aristocracy, finds himself stranded on his family's kingdom, now uninhabited and reduced to ashes. The spoiled son of a wiped-out empire tries to save mankind by attempting to travel back in time and prevent the destruction of Earth by the Dark Soldiers.
