Redemption Stone

 Redemption Stone introduces Tom Lewis, a storyteller of quiet power, who recounts the social upheaval and rebirth that shape his unique American journey. Born into a dirt-poor family of sixteen children in a small Southern town, Lewis slowly makes his way through the world first as a migrant worker, a factory laborer, a soldier and finally a riot cop on the mean streets of Washington, D.C. Lewis' life takes a final twist when he buys a burned out old crack house in one of the roughest run-down neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., and opens up a place he calls The Fishing School. It's here that Lewis turns hardship into hope for the children of his community.
