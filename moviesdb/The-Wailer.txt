The Wailer

 On their way to Mexico, six students are stranded in a small town where years before a tragedy took place. The students find accommodation in a small cabin where unexplainable things begin to happen; a woman's weeping is heard all around the cabin and their fear of the horror they might find outside keeps them trapped in the cabin. They will soon learn the truth behind the legend of "La Llorona".
