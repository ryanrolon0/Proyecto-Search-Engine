To the Sea

 Suffolk Coast. The present. A quiet dawn creeps into a family home. The morning routine is punctured when the father hears a cry for help in the sea. He sees a man struggling in the water, but does nothing as the man slowly drowns. His inability to discuss the death creates a fracture within his family. He must shut out his guilt, with the sound of the sea.
