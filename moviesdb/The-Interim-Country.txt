The Interim Country

 The film chronicles the ever-deepening chaos, into which Kyrgyzstan, a small, land-locked country in Central Asia, plunged after a popular revolt that led to the toppling of president Bakiev and his clan in April 2010, culminating with large-scale inter-ethnic violence in June 2010.
