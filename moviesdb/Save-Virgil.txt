Save Virgil

 "Save Virgil," a short film by Brad Ableson ("The Simpsons"), combines live-action and animation to tell the perverse story of Virgil (voiced by Adam Carolla), a cartoon character who is mysteriously born into the real world. Shunned by his classmates, nomadic biker father, and porn-star mother (Ginger Lynn), Virgil hitchhikes to Hollywood in search of his soul mate, Viking Girl, a voluptuous TV cartoon action-heroine he believes to exist. Along the way, Virgil deals with monkeys, motorcycles, marijuana, and learns from Gary Coleman the tragic price of fame.
