The Father

 A young father, home from a busy day as an auto mechanic, finds his son sulking on a swing set. He confronts the boy about a prior quarrel between them - wanting to reach the boy without either coddling him or scolding him further. When the father makes an ill-considered choice, his relationship with his son goes in a shocking direction, culminating in a sad loss for them both.
