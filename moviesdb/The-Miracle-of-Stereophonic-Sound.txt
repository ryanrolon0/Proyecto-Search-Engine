The Miracle of Stereophonic Sound

 This CinemaScope short explains all the wonders of full, four-track high fidelity magnetic stereophonic sound. The system is compared to regular optical sound, and then is demostrated in a performance of Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the Flowers." Alfred Newman leads the Twentieth Century-Fox (note the correct "hyphen" between Century and Fox)Symphony Orchestra.
