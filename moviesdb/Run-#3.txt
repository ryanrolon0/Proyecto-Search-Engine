Run #3

 Lily's bicycle is her closest friend, her only escape from the misery at home and also the vehicle her alcoholic mother forces her to use to make booze runs. Pushed to her limit Lily chooses to destroy what is most dear to her in order to take a stand against her mom's drinking. Will this be her coming of age, or her initiation into a cycle of abuse?
