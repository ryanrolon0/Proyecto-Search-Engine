Slinging Mud

 Slinging Mud is a short mockumentary about three 9th grade students running for class president. We follow the candidates, David, Merideth, and Orlando and each of their camps as they prepare for the big presidential debate coming up at the end of the school day. Meanwhile, the school news reporter uncovers that someone has slung mud at one of the candidates posters and decides to get to the bottom of "these vicious attacks." As she interviews each candidate and their camps in an attempt to uncover the truth, we discover how parallel these students to our own political powers that be. It's a film about art imitating life...what happens when real mud, and not just words are slung.
