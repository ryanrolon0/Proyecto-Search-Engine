Six Hits and a Miss

 An extended version of Warren and Dubin's "You've Got to Know How to Dance," played by Rudolf Friml Jr. and his band, in an elegant urban setting, sung by Six Hits and a Miss - she sings lead, they harmonize - and tap-danced on an elegant dance floor and wide staircases by the Dancing Colleens, with solos by Paul Draper and Ruby Keeler. It's white tie and tails for Paul and the other dancing men, white evening dresses for Ruby and the Colleens.
