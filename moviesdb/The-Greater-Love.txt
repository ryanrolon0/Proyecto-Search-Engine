The Greater Love

 Ed Evans kissed Betty goodbye and went West. In a Mexican boarding house he met Conchita, who promptly fell in love with him. One day Jose, her lover, hurled a rock from far up on the mountains and broke Ed.'s leg. Betty in a distant city, hearing of the accident, at once went West to his bedside. And then Conchita realized the truth. Jose took advantage of the chance to attempt Evan's life. Conchita, hovering over the sick man, saw the knife over her shoulder, threw herself upon the sick man and received the blade through her back, thus sacrificing her life that Evans might live and be happy.
