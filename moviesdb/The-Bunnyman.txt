The Bunnyman

 Society is ruled over by a giant dog that is using the recent surge of monster attacks to try and convince his people to sign up for "optional" brain surgery. A self appointed "monster hunter" in a pink bunny suit is the only person brave enough to stand up to the creatures but soon runs into trouble when his girlfriend is kidnapped by the Macaroni Gang. He goes on a warpath through the seedy underworld of The Dog's dystopian society while trying to fight hallucinations brought on talking worms living inside his large intestine. Dogshit blends live action and animation together to create a psychedelic nightmare world of doom and despair, and other awesome keywords.
