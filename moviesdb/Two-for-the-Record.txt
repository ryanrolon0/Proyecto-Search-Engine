Two for the Record

 Two Benny Goodman songs are paired with animated sequences in this short film, originally created for Disney's 'Make Mine Music'. In "After You've Gone", animated musical instruments dance along with a jazz tune in surreal settings. In "All the Cats Join In", a group of teens go to the local malt shop and dance to a jazzy jukebox tune.
