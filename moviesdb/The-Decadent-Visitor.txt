The Decadent Visitor

 In a rural Czech village, 9 year old Martin is waiting for the arrival of his famous uncle, Roman. A Czech emigre, Roman has found great success as a film critic in Hollywood. Martin's mother, Dana, is waiting also. Waiting for her yearly liaison with Roman, an affair she began after her jealous husband (Roman's brother) was sent to prison for murdering her ex-lover. The three village gossips are waiting, too. Waiting on the bench where they sit every day, ready to spread the details of Dana's annual indiscretion. But when Roman invites Dana to a party of his ex-lovers, and a mysterious stranger arrives with a letter from Martin's father, this year's visit will become different. In a decidedly more decadent way. As seen through the eyes of Martin, "The Decadent Visitor" tells the story of three generations coming to grips with a new society and a pervasive Western influence.
