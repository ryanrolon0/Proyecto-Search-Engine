Rapid Fire

 In Norco, California, four rednecks plot a bank robbery using heavy ammunition to intimidate clients and the police force expecting to have better life. However, one employee activates the silent alarm in the police station, and the criminals are chased by the police and LA SWAT. In despair, they shoot about 20,000 shots, kill one policeman, hit other eight, and destroy many cars and properties and one helicopter. In the end, the two survivors are sentenced to life without parole. A desperate band of Militia men attempts a daylight bank robbery in the sleepy semi-rural City of Norco, California, and leads the local Police on the longest, most violent running gun battle in Law Enforcement history. Based on the true events.
