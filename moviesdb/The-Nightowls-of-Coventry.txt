The Nightowls of Coventry

 Cleveland. 1973. Marv, the owner of an old neighborhood Jewish deli, must stay open 24 hours to cater to a new generation of clientele, but straight-laced neighborhood do-gooders want to close him down. Meanwhile inside, hippies, bikers and crusty old Jewish men, caught in the throes of changing times and culture clash, fight over turf and yearn for a waitress to take their orders. Into this milieu drops new waitress, Susan, a wholesome small town beauty who must struggle with testy customers, a dubious romance, and a jealous head-waitress. Her future and the fate of the regulars hang by a thread as Marv takes increasingly desperate measures to save his deli. A "dramedy" set in a 24-hour deli in an old Jewish neighborhood, circa 1973. Once thriving, Marv's Deli is now home to a bickering crew of regulars left behind in the wake of urban flight. There are Doug and Dee, two freeloading hippie hustlers; Sheldon, a political radical without a cause; and old-timer Benny, whose warmth is matched only by his tendency to pry into other people's business -- especially that of the new waitress, Susan. An innocent girl, Susan tries to avoid the unwelcome advances of Marv and the dagger stares from his mistress, head server Grace. Finally, there is Marv himself, a proud but terminal dreamer who launches one scheme after another to prop up the struggling deli. But Marv's old fashioned remedies no longer work in an increasingly impersonal world. In an era of Watergate and moonwalks, Marv's hangs on - but for how long?
