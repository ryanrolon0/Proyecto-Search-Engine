Pretty Kitty

 A portrait of mental illness. It's morning, birds are chirping outside the bedroom window of a solitary man, in bed in pajamas, his cat Spike on the bedspread next to him. The man starts a monologue directed at the cat. After working himself into a lather, the man rummages through the utensil drawer in the kitchen, finally satisfied that a melon baller will do the trick. The man eyes the cat's dish of food. Is the pretty kitty safe?
