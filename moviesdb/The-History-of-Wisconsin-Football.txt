The History of Wisconsin Football

 "Why Not Wisconsin?" was the rallying cry for the 1993 season as the University of Wisconsin Badgers headed toward their first Rose Bowl victory under Head Coach Barry Alvarez. But the Badgers football legacy began nearly 100 years earlier at the turn of the century when College Football Hall of Famer Pat O'Dea, the "Kangaroo Kicker", thrilled fans around the nation. This action-packed and fascinating DVD explores the famous names, games and plays that formed the great football traditions of this Big Ten favorite.
