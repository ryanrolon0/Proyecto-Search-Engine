The Eyes of Edward James

 Shot in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, THE EYES OF EDWARD JAMES tells the story of Edward, a patient regressed into the traumatic memory of the evening that his wife, Sarah, is brutally murdered. As his memory unfolds, however, it becomes apparent that Edward is not being completely honest with his doctor, just as Sarah was not being entirely honest with him on the night of her death.
