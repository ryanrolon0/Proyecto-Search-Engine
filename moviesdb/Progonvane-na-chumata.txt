Progonvane na chumata

 The film deals with the cult to the Plague. The worship of the Plague has been widely spread in the Balkans. Today the only people who keep the holiday of 'Bibi' (the Plague) in its original are the gypsies from the town of Vidin, Bulgaria. This holiday can be observed only in remote Australia, where it has developed into a gypsy religious cult.
