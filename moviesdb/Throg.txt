Throg

 In this dark comedy inspired by the medieval fantasy genre, an immortal idiot is chosen to champion the bored Gods of Mount Olympus. Poor Throg, ever the optimist, stumbles through history, leaving a trail of comic carnage in his wake. Along the way, he meets talking pigs, Arthurian knights, evil clowns, and the sadistic green man of the forest. Are his stories the ravings of a deranged lunatic, or will he truly achieve his "density?" Only time will tell.
