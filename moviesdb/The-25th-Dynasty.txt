The 25th Dynasty

 At the opening of our film there exists two worlds that stand in close opposition to each other - the Egyptian world and the Assyrian world - each containing a small group of characters that we focus the audiences' interest. Our drama consists in the collision of these two worlds that leads to the destruction of the 25th Dynasty and the ushering in of Assyrian rule of Egypt. Our Egyptian story begins with the introduction of Prince Taharqa and his father, King Piye, in a victory procession having conquered further territories in Egypt. The Kushite world now intrudes upon world history making them an open target for the Assyrians. This is the personal story of Taharqa of Egypt and King Esarhaddon of Assyria.
