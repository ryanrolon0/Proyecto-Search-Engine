SNL Fanatic

 This parody of the MTV program Fanatic (in which people attempt to prove their fandom of stars in order to meet them) features a fan obsessed with Anna Nicole Smith. But before his meeting with her we learn of his dysfunction and sick mother-based fantasies over Anna Nicole. This only escalates when he meets the more dysfunctional Anna Nicole.
