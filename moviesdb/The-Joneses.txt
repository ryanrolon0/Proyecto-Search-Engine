The Joneses

 For two couples - Ally and Mitch, and Paul and Suzanne - life seems to have turned out pretty well. They are neighbors with a deep friendship who engage in a bit of friendly competition. But anything goes in suburbia, and a healthy game of oneupmanship is soon overtaken by deliberate sabotage. Careers are targeted, marriages attacked. Even the furniture isn't safe. In the aftermath of neighborly rivalry, the players are left to pick up the pieces. Is there still a game to be won? Or can redemption be found? One thing is for certain being the best feels better, there are secrets to be uncovered... and indeed, keeping up with the Joneses can be hazardous to your health.
