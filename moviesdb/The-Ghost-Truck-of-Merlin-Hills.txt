The Ghost Truck of Merlin Hills

 For over fifty years mysterious car crashes have claimed the lives of tens of victims in the Kimberton/Merlin Hills area of suburban Pennsylvania. According to legend, a black truck stalks the back roads at night with its headlights off. Well-meaning fellow travelers seeking to warn the truck by flashing their lights are chased down and brutally run off the road. The Ghost Truck of Merlin Hills follows 'Dorian,' the serial hit-and-run artist behind these crashes, on his nightly drive. His likable manner and lofty existentialism may be lost on his victims but not on two young documentarians, who seek to tell this suburban legend from all sides while getting some killer footage.
