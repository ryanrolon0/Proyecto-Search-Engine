The Inheritance of Light

 Art is a medium of expression, expression is an image of your feelings and feelings are the emotions that lie deep within our hearts. All of the above can be seen, felt and touched in the works of a man who created his world out of hundreds of different colors. Veteran painter Jehangir Sabavala. This grandson of great philanthropist Sir Cawasjee Jehangir, has painted more then 220 pictures, exhibited in cities like London, Paris and New York. Caverns Measureless to Man, The Radiant Cloud, Icarus and The Predator are some of his indisputable classics. Elegant, sensitive, bright and extremely pure. And to prove it, he has an experience of more than 60 years as a globally renowned artist. Today at 88, he continues to wave those strokes of bright colors and combination's, thinking there is still an expression, hidden somewhere deep within his conscience which is eager to come out. Author and biographer Ranjit Hoskote talks to the eminent artist and his wife in "The Inheritance of Light whether or not his upbringing as a Zoroastrian (Parsee) influenced his work spanning over six decades.
