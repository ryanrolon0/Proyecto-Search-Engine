This Kiss

 What happens when best friends from childhood reconnect after a decade, only to discover that they barely recognise each other? Tempers fly, tears fall, closet doors swing open and skeletons fall out. In a long, boozy afternoon played out against a sun-drenched Australian landscape, the two friends reveal their imperfections, share laughter and finally confront an incident from the past that has haunted them both. Official Selection Melbourne Queer Film Festival, Frameline and Outfest 2007.
