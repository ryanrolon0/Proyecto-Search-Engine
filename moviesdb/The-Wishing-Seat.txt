The Wishing Seat

 She was romanceful, and longed for a lover- so she sat in the "Wishing Seat," and wished! When lo! her wish was answered. Down to her feet rolled an artist from a neighbouring bluff, feet over head, and badly besmeared with his paint and the dirt of the mountain-side. But he didn't care how Cupid came, so long as he came!
