The Lions and Tin Horn Sports

 There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing this title was ever produced or distributed at this time. It's yet another bogus title emanating from the error-filled Universal Silents by Richard E. Braff; the alleged release date is bogus as well. Most likely, it's a working title for some other film, released at some other time, under a different title.
