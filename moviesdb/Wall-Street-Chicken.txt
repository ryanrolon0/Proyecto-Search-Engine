Wall Street Chicken

 Kid is a young Wall Street broker who is used to working long hours and taking naps on his pillow under his desk, as everybody does. When his financial firm goes bankrupt, he suddenly finds himself on the street one morning, a box with his belongings and his pillow with him. In his attempt to make some sense of that situation, a coworker engages him in a pillow fight, that turns massive.
