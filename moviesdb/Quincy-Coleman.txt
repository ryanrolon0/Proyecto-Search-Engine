Quincy Coleman

 She fell in love with the shoes. Don't be fooled by her name. Quincy John Coleman doesn't have an identity crisis. She is a 'girly girl' down to her core who has found the shoes she was meant to wear. A woman of many names and many talents, her soulful voice aches to be heard by anyone who will listen.
