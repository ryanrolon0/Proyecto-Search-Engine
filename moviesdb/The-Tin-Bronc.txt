The Tin Bronc

 Miggs, a cowhand employed on the D-Bar Ranch, is the sweetheart of Margaret MacDonald, the daughter of the ranch owner, but her father, Morgan MacDonald, is not all that excited by Miggs. Especially, when on a trip to town to pick up the weekly payroll for the ranch, Miggs is more interested about buying a new car rather than help guard the money bag. Morgan and Margaret start back to the ranch while Miggs follows in his new 'tin broncho." They, of course, are held up and robbed, and Miggs has to recover the money or be fired.
