The Frontiersman's Wife

 After moving out of the city, Melissa Oliphant begins seeing a new man every night... her husband. Diagnosed with parasomnia, Melissa's husband begins to exhibit extreme sleepwalking on a nightly basis. The man she confronts at night, however, is a completely different person than in his waking state. But as their marriage crumbles during the day, Melissa increasingly finds solitude in her new-found nocturnal relationship. Creating an alternate, prairie universe in their living room every evening, Melissa and her sleeping husband develop a fantastical world that overshadows her daily reality. But as Melissa attempts to prolong exposure with her nighttime husband, her actions ripple into waking life.
