Underlife

 Underlife is a movie inspired by the famous Lullaby of Kristofer Komeda. It deals with the destructive influence, which our ancestors sometimes exert on us and presents it in the form of a metaphor. The central question of the film is how much we can do to shed the burden of this ancestral force. The film touches a universal problem of our subconscious circumstances, which also define and limit our life
