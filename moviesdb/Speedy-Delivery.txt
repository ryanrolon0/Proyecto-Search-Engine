Speedy Delivery

 A wig, mustache and timeless uniform help transform DAVID NEWELL into the whimsical MR. MCFEELY, an authentic character who always delivers. "Speedy Delivery" follows Newell's global quest to save "The Neighborhood," infused with a deep retrospective look into what made 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood' the longest running children's show in history.
