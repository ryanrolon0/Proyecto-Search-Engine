Shane Warne

 Onto sport's most traditional stage stepped a unique personality - extroverted, showy, contentious but, above all, astonishingly gifted. In a decade of absolute extremes, he would inflame cricketing passions wherever the game is played. Reaching back into history, he dusted off the ancient art of leg-spinning and revived it as a magical act bewildering the best batsmen of the era. All the while the spotlight tracked him from the summits of triumph to the clamour of controversy and back again. Whatever the occasion, the game has never seen anything quite like Shane Keith Warne.
