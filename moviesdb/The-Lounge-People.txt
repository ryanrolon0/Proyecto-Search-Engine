The Lounge People

 Louis and Cynthia Lewis are an insanely rich couple suffering from an acute case of boredom on their private island estate. Louis produces his own version of "Moby Dick" to end the tedium and to get his mind off his recently-discovered ill health; meanwhile, his wife and the three-person staff engage in several sexual escapades with each other.
