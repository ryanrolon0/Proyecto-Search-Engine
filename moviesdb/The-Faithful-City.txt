The Faithful City

 Produced in Israel in English with an international cast, "The Faithful City" depicts some of the courage, patience, bravery and understanding that attended the birth of Israel as a free and independent nation. The larger story is told within the framework of a simple story regarding the rehabilitation of orphaned-children from war-ravaged Europe. Sam, a counselor from a boy's camp in New York state, is at first confident that children are children no matter what their backgrounds. He soon finds the young refugees to be mature, tough, and living by the creed of 'survival at any cost.' One of the children,Max, frustrates Sam by his dishonesty and cockiness.
