Return of the Lash

 To fight Kirby and his gang, Tom Grant sends for Cheyenne Davis. To get money the ranchers need, Davis brings in wanted outlaws and sends Fuzzy to collect the rewards. But Fuzzy is waylaid on the return and loses his memory. Now neither Cheyenne or the outlaws know where the money is. A range war has made a deserted town of Sagebrush, where Big Jim Kirby and Jeff Harper are fighting it out to get control of the ranch owned by Tom Grant and his sister Kay. They want it because it controls the town's water supply and is also the site for a projected railroad. "Fuzzy" Jones rides into town seeking peaceful employment, but becomes involved in the fighting. He sends for his friend "Cheyenne" Davis, who learns that the ranchers are all in imminent danger of losing their property because they don't have enough money to meet their debts. Upon learning that Kirby's henchmen are all "wanted" men with prices on their heads, "Cheyenne" suggest that these men be rounded up and taken to the state capital for the reward money.
