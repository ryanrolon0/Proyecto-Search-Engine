The Devil's Playthings

 Five teenagers playing with a Ouija Board are led to a sacred binding place for the malevolent demon Asmodeus who, five years prior, possessed a young girl, forcing her to murder her own sister. Now the demon seeks its freedom, and is bent on murdering the exorcist who imprisoned it -- by using the body of the priest's own niece!
