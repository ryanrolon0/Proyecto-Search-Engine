The Catcher

 Inspired by the final chapter of JD Salinger's ' The Catcher in the Rye'. A runaway teenager wakes on the cliffs of a Sydney beach and remembers what's she's done and that she's on the run. As she runs the story deconstructs itself- she's no victim, she's got a plan of escape and revenge. Shot entirely from the runaways point of view.
