Van Hook

 Two young men from North Dakota, Kip and Job are shown their "Alternate lives" as an escape from what they called, "Minot-ony." Their journey begins when they visit Van Hook (arm), a part of nearby Lake Sakagawea. While at Van Hook they meet Andrew, a Native American man who tells the young men, "Sometimes the circle of life gets twisted." When they return to their small town, they find themselves wanted for a murder they didn't commit.
