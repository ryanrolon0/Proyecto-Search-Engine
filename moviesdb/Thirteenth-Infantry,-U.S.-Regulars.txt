Thirteenth Infantry, U.S. Regulars

 "This shows the famous regiment, of which we were privileged to take so many excellent pictures at Governor's Island before the Spanish-American War. This scene, however, is a sad contrast to the dress parade at the post on Governor's Island. Only a mere handful of men are left, and they are battle-scarred and worn."
