S.A.T.

 Noah is your average teenager. He's got a best friend, a recent ex-girlfriend, and competition from the typical pretty-boy teacher's pet. He often lacks enthusiasm towards school, preferring to spend his time with his guitar, which he hopes to bring with him all the way to Julliard But the SATs first, of course. No sweat, though. Right? Or at least, that's how Noah begins to think of the challenge. Soon enough, however, he realizes that the SATs might be a little more than 'just some stupid test.'
