The Quiet American

 Saigon, 1952, a beautiful, exotic, and mysterious city caught in the grips of the Vietnamese war of liberation from the French colonial powers. New arrival Alden Pyle, an idealistic American aid worker, befriends London Times correspondent Thomas Fowler. When Fowler introduces Pyle to his beautiful young Vietnamese mistress Phuong the three become swept up in a tempestuous love triangle that leads to a series of startling revelations and finally - murder. Nothing, and no one, is as it seems, in this adaptation of Graham Greene's classic and prophetic story of love, betrayal, murder and the origin of the American war in Vietnam. Love, politics and intrigue intermingle in this taut retelling of Graham Greene's classic tale of a disillusioned British journalist, an idealistic young American and the beautiful Vietnamese woman that comes between them in 1950s Saigon. In Saigon, 1951, Thomas Fowler is an English journalist, married in England with a catholic woman, and in love with a Vietnamese girl, Phuong. Thomas meets Alden Pyle in a bar. Pyle is a doctor working in an aid mission, and pretty soon, he falls in love with Phuong. Pyle offers her what Thomas is not possible to give, i.e., a marriage and escape of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the political situation in Vietnam is boiling, with the French trying to get control again of the country, the communists trying to impose their system to the South, and the American secretly giving support to a third Vietnamese part.
