The Vessel

 A crack team of paranormal investigators enters a turn of the century abandoned jail looking for answers to a two decade old mystery of a wrongly executed man. They are joined by family members connected to the case and a troubled man with the ability to channel spirits named Jason Brooks (Stu Brumbaugh). They soon learn that the mystery they're pursuing isn't nearly as horrifying as the secrets of the jail itself. They find themselves on lock-down trying to solve this mystery as they fight for survival and face the terrible evil within.
