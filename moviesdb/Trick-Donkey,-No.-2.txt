Trick Donkey, No. 2

 One of the funniest and liveliest subjects ever produced is seen in this film. A clown brings on his donkey, an apparently docile animal. A fresh coon tries to mount him when he is thrown in the air as if by electricity. Several other "smokes" jump on the donkey's back, but are flung in the air in a similar manner. The picture concludes with a funny sight. Three darkies clamber on the back of our docile friend and at the command of the master he remains perfectly quiet until they are firmly seated, when he throws the bunch of "dark clouds" in all directions. One little coon persists in riding the donkey, and jumping on his back, he wraps his legs and arms around him, but is finally thrown. The donkey is victorious and appears to smile at his crestfallen colored friends. Rich and exciting.
