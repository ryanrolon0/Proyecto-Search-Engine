Scalp Treatment

 Woody Woodpecker is getting his feathers trimmed by Buzz Buzzard on their Indian reservation when a pretty Indian maiden passes by. Woody and Buzz both instantly fall in love and try to court her, but when she asks either one of them to buy her an expensive bonnet they are both broke. Buzz decides to scalp Woody and use his feathers to make a bonnet, but Woody objects highly at that proposition.
