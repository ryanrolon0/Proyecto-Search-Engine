The Towers

 Witness a true craftsman at work. With no money, but the need for expression, Simon Rodia, an Italian immigrant, built the amazing Watts Towers in an outside district of LA. Watch actual footage of Simon hard at work, as he is on a never-ending mission to create beauty. Inspired by Galileo and the architecture of Italy, Simon succeeded in making himself known around the country. As a tribute to this fine artist, The Towers tells the story of a noble man with an inspiring talent, a true hero in history.
