The Secret of the Whistler

 An artist married to a wealthy but ill woman begins an affair with one of his models, who is after him solely for his money. His wife discovers the affair and threatens to cut him out of her will. In order to be able to keep both the wife's money and his girlfriend, he begins to secretly poison his wife - but events take a surprising turn after she eventually dies. Artist Richard Harrison is married to a wealthy-but-invalid wife, Edith Marie, and he falls in love with his model, Kay Morell, whose only interest in him is his money, or, as things exist, his wife's money. He poisons his wife's medicine but she sees him doing it and does not take the medicine, but she records the incident in her diary. She dies of natural causes, and Richard marries Kay, who blackmails him with his wife's diary that would lead the police to suspect he had killed her. Richard, once again, finds himself with one wife too many, but what is a poor artist supposed to do.
