The Ten Commandments

 The tale of two brothers, Moses and Ramses destiny, they lead their two nations in an epic struggle between slavery and liberty. The Hebrews were slaves in Egypt 3,300 years ago. When Moses, a Hebrew baby raised as a brother to the Egyptian prince, learned of his true origins, he was thrust into a new life, leading his people to freedom. But liberty was not enough. To survive and thrive, they had to discover the rules of human decency, The Ten Commandments. Live at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.
