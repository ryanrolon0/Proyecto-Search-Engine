 After a collapse of a TV-company, Alice, Ada and Jana pull themselves together and establish their own company. They start rent out costumes and provide make-up services. Dressing up people who seek a new identity for one night, is a job that requires wizard-like imagination - coming up with crazy ideas, but acting with good taste and subtlety. Despite the competition and disagreements they manage to run their business successfully until the day when the love affair of the youngest woman takes a fatal turn. Company will be closed, and they find themselves back where they started. By portraying these three women and their clients, the film provides an intriguing picture of urban people, looking for their identity in a country in big changes - their worries and their striving towards something new, something prospering, something beautiful.
