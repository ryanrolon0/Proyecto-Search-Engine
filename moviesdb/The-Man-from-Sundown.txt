The Man from Sundown

 When young rancher Tom Kellogg is murdered just as he is about to testify against a gang of outlaws, Texas Ranger Larry Whelen arrive on the scene and sweeps into action. He traces the outlaws to their hideout and, accompanied by Barbara Kellogg, the murdered rancher's sister, leads a posse of Rangers and ranchers against the gang.
