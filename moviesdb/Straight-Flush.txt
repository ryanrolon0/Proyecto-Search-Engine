Straight Flush

 Closing up his bar one night, Vic gets an unusual last-call request. Richie, a jaded woman on the eve of her thirtieth birthday, only wants one birthday present. She wants to kill herself in Vic's bar tonight, and doesn't mind taking him with her. Vic - a reluctant but captive audience - has seen and heard it all, and takes the threat in stride. When he refuses to grant her wish, a dangerous argument ensues. Just as things reach a boiling point, an unexpected visitor is thrown in the mix and Vic and Richie are forced to figure out what it means to be a 'good' person.
