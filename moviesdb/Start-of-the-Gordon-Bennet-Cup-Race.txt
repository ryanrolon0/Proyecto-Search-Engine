Start of the Gordon-Bennet Cup Race

 This is a companion picture to the above film [AT TERRIFIC SPEED] and gives a nearer view of the huge high-power machines as they leave the starting point. The various types of cars illustrating American, French and English manufacture are easily distinguished. Each contestant is cheered as he starts out and it is altogether a very lively view.
