The High Powered Rifle

 Private detective Stephen Dancer is snooping around in the activities of some heroin dealers and they object strongly; first he is wounded by a sniper firing a high-powered rifle, then he gets a bomb tossed at him, and then is ambushed at a rendezvous at the lily pond. Finally, gang-moll Sharon Hill vamps him to distraction and she is able to shoot him. Lots of people get shot in this one, and some of them survive, but most don't.
