The Opposite of Shearing Sheep

 On November 1, 2005 nine men from across America ceased shaving. They were each given a camera and asked to film themselves for at least an hour each week. Six months later they shaved. No trimming was allowed. During that time one man said goodbye to his father; another had a child, and life carried on. The Opposite of Shearing Sheep is an experimental documentary cobbled together using only moments captured by the process and marked by the beards to create a raw and wandering film about life.
