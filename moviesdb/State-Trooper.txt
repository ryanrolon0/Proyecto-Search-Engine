State Trooper

 Mike Rolph quits his job, seemingly, as a highway patrolman and takes the position of the Police Chief of W. J. Brady's oil refinery. He is also romantically involved with Brady's daughter, June. It appears that some highly-placed employee has sold out to the opposition refinery people, and much sabotage and havoc is being caused.
