St. Christopher's Code

 Three close friends in a private Catholic boys' school have always looked out for each other in their mission to beat the system. Each is in constant vigilance to make sure no other falls victim to the oppressive school administration. But one boy comes to learn a hard lesson when his future success depends upon leaving his friends and sacrificing his principles.
