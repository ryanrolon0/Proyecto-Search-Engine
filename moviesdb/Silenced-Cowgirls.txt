Silenced Cowgirls

 Three vingettes of cowgirls in bondage. In the first, a bad city girl steals a good cowgirl's valuable stamp collection. In the second, a cowgirl stumbles into an outlaw's lair and is soon joined by another nosy lady. In the third two cowgirls guarding the ranch payroll are captured by a villain.
