The Polar Run 2009

 In 2009 the world-class adventurers Ray Zahab and Kevin Vallely will join forces to do the impossible-run more than 500 miles to the geographic North Pole. Without the usual benefit of skis or extensive polar gear, the two runners will travel light in an attempt to set an arctic record by covering this route in 25 days. As the two runners make athletic history, their adventure will be documented on film - a visual tale to educate, inspire, and to provoke action.
