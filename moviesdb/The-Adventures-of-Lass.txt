The Adventures of Lass

 When a bratty girl named Ashley visits her absent-minded and bi-polar grandmother, Lass, in the old folks home, she never could expect the strange tale her grandmother shares with her. She talks of her days as a child with her large dysfunctional family, including her stern mother, her dutiful brother, her disabled sister, the codependent twins, the tattle-tale little sister, the mischievous, penny-whistle obsessed brother, the cardboard cut out of a sister and milking obsessed father. Although, the family is in dire need of a chicken, the only one Lass can find is an old crusty chicken that is about to keel over any second now. But it's harder to get rid of than you think. Will Lass succeed in selling the chicken? And is there something strange and mysterious going on in Lass' own home?
