The Bargain of the Century

 On their way to a bargain sale, Thelma and Zazu are pulled over by a motorcycle cop. Zazu poses as the police lieutenant's daughter, and they enlist the cop, Butterworth, in helping them buy merchandise at the sale. When the lieutenant finds out about the ruse, he fires Butterworth whom the girls then hire as a housekeeper. When Zazu meets a police captain, she contrives to invite him home so Butterworth can impress him and get his job back. Will anything go right?
