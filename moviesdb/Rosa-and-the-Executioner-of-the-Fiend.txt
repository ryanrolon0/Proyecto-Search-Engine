Rosa and the Executioner of the Fiend

 Rosa, a Holocaust survivor, is an octogenarian widow who has lived alone for more than 50 years in an apartment across the United Nations. When an intruder gets hold of her place, she takes him for a thief, a rapist and then a Nazi agent. But he is none of that. His mission is "to execute the greatest S.O.B. the world has ever known". The drama that connects these two fictional characters is linked to five real episodes Louis, in 1939; their arrival in Havana and their entrance denial; the indifference by the United States that send them back to Europe; the tragedy of the Cuban children who participated in the Pedro Pan Rescue Project, and a historical U.N. General Assembly of world leaders.
