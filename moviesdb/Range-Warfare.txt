Range Warfare

 Marshal Reb Russell's reputation precedes him and when he arrives the outlaw gang that includes the Sheriff and that has been doing all the rustling, captures him and plans to hang him. Tommy Lord, the man the crooked Sheriff wants for the rustling, helps him escape. Posing as a rustler he gets the Indian Agent to admit he is the buyer and to reveal who the rustlers are. Having cleared Tommy of the rustling charge he goes after the gang.
