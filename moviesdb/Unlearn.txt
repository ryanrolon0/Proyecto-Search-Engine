Unlearn

 Unlearn challenges the negative misconceptions often associated with mental illness by documenting the courage of three Canadians. Darlene Byrom explains the difficulties her son faces growing up with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Bob Rae, former Ontario premiere, discusses is early bout with depression and promotes his ongoing desire for public support. Michelle Prosserman explores how the stigma associated with schizophrenia affected her recovery. Dr. David Goldbloom, Senior Medical Advisor at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, ties the stories together with the central message that anyone can suffer mental illness and that we must work together to break the stigma.
