Pugni, pupe e marinai

 Three sailors are sent to an island by their commander to steal a boat, but they are sunk by an enemy ship. Saved from the shipwreck by a fishing boat, they have to get back to the island before their commander knows about their adventure. Four sailors are sent to a desert island as a punishment. Three of them are able to reach Naples. Alberto is trying to find Stella, his love her but she is engaged to a cameraman. Antonio is looking for Grazia whom he deserted before enlisting. Now she works for a Television Studio where he and Raffaele, the other sailor, are able to go in. In the Studios Raffaele falls for Gloria and both of them are pursued by the patrol commanded by Capo Campana. They have, however, to go back to the island before their period of punishment ends. It won't be an easy thing to do.
