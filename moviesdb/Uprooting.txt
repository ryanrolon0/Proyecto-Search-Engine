Uprooting

 'Uprooting' explores the idea of one who has, for a long time, fed a false sense of security with familiarity. Set in a surreal environment, which from an outside perspective looks dangerous and lonely, the character begins to feel a strong desire to leave yet is sentimentally attached to her 'home.' this inner conflict is one that all of us can identify with each time we face the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, yet it must be taken.
