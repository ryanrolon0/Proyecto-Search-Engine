Reel Guerrillas

 Nick Walker is on a desperate quest for a "reel" and this quest takes him on a humorous journey. He has some connections and great friends, but that just isn't enough. He is under pressure from his family to make it happen within a year or return home and take over the family farm. In a twist of fate he is given the opportunity to approach one of the "gods" for help, but he is told to make it happen on his own. In an unplanned, unrehearsed moment of brilliance, he stages a faux holdup of a liquor store and uses the surveillance tape as his "reel". The rest is Hollywood history.
