Sweetheart of the Fleet

 Secretary Phoebe Weyms is in love with her ad-agency boss, Gordon Crouse, but he doesn't give her the time of day. In order to attract his attention, Phoebe contacts the Navy Recruiting Station, and offers to unmask the two mystery girls. They sing on the "Blind Date" radio program, at a gigantic recruiting rally. Crouse is irate at what she has done because, as he tells Phoebe, the "Blind Date" girls, Brenda and Cobina, are clock-stoppingly ugly. Phoebe suggest that two of the agency models, Jerry Gilbert and Kitty Leslie, pose as the two singers while Brenda and Cobina do the actual singing behind a curtain. Breanda and Cobina agree but under the condition that they must be supplied with sailor boy-friends. Led to believe that B&C are voice teachers for Jerry and Kitty, the Navy commander, sends sailors "Hambone" Skelly and "Daffy" Dill around to act as Brenda and Cobina's escorts. But Brenda and Cobina elope with their sailor escorts, and Phoebe is left with two masked "Blind Date" singers...who can't sing.
