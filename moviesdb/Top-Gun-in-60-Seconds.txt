Top Gun in 60 Seconds

 Mark Wong and Chris Slaughter's remake of the classic 'Top Gun' features most of your favorite characters and plot points from the 1986 version, plus just the right amount of comedy that the original lacked. 'Top Gun in 60 Seconds' was even filmed with a real fighter jet. Edgar Wright and the others from the Empire Movie Awards' judges panel loved it because 'Top Gun in 60 Seconds' took home the top prize for the Empire Movie Awards' Done in 60 Seconds competition in March 2010.
