Under the Harlem Moon

 Under the Harlem Moon weaves the story of a diva mother and her two daughters in Harlem in the twenties and thirties. Replete with two invigorating swing dance scenes and a breathtaking vocal performance by Tamela Aldridge, Under the Harlem Moon explores the artistic contributions of the Harlem Renaissance while following two sisters in their search for a balance between their lives and each other.
