Samsaram

 A middle class government clerk Raghu (NTR), lives happily with his wife Manjula (Laxmirajyam) until his scheming mother Venkamma (Suryakantham), his sister Kamakshi (Balasaraswathi) and her cowardly husband (Venkatramiah) move into his house. Venkamma appropriates all of raghu's earnings and Kamakshi plots to have manujala blamed for all that goes wrong in the household. Raghu unable to pay his pregnant wifes's medical fees, loses his job and abandons his family. His brother venu (ANR), a flirt who lives off his girl friend kamala (puspalatha) and her rich father, eventually traces raghu and finds him a job as a porter in mill.
