Texas Masquerade

 Maxson and Trimble are using the Night Riders to scare the ranchers off their land knowing there is oil under the ground. Finding a wounded lawyer Corwin, Hoppy assumes his identity. But Sam Nolan knows Hoppy and when he arrives in town the Masquerade is over. "Hopalong" Cassidy impersonates an eastern-dude and wears fancy-dress clothes in order to hide his identity while forcing a band of outlaws, headed by the town lawyer, to reveal their hands in their attempt to steal ownership of valuable oil-bearing lands from the valley ranchers who are unaware of the potential wealth of their property. Once aware of the circumstances responsible for the reign of terror against the ranchers, "Hoppy" resumes his identity and, with the aid of his pals California Carlson and Jimmy Rogers and a posse, beats the gang and its leader.
