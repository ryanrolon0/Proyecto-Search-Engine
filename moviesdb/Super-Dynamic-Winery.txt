Super Dynamic Winery

 Everyone needs a 'Plan B', something to fall back on. Being a crime-fighting super hero (or evildoer) doesn't exactly pay the bills and won't go on forever. We take a look at a group of caped crusaders and their backup plan for the future. Why not run a winery? Everybody loves wine. Everyone needs a backup plan, everyone loves wine. A crime-fighting gig doesn't last forever. Put those things together and you get a mad-capped group of caped crusaders trying run a winery. Every Hero has a 'special' skill that helps turn each year's crop of grapes into a wine that expresses each of their abilities. What could taste better than a wine made by a super hero? This documentary dives head first into the shallow yet fertile ground of the Super Dynamic Winery.
