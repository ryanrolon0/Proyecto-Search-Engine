Spirit Ship

 Spirit Ship, (HD/Super 8) a live-action narrative short (shot in Red Hook) was a collaboration with six children who reacted to a range of props then viewed the footage and provided voice over narration. The film follows three Children of Earth as they explore the crumbling shoreline of a Broken Land by the sea and stumble upon a pile of detritus from what appears to be a shipwreck. The children sift through these strange treasures, fall asleep and dream about the stories living inside them, then go looking for the mysterious people who left them behind. Meanwhile, three Spirit Children are on their own journey within an alternate universe that flickers with dream-like film footage of bygone yards and playgrounds. Will the two groups finally meet?
