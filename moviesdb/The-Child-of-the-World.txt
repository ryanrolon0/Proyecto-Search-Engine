The Child of the World

 It was the beauty of a world that was. And no one could see it but Kevin himself. Not even his sister and sole caregiver, Clarissa could. Devastated by the loss of his mother, Kevin conceives an imaginary guardian figure, The Old One, vested with the ability to materialise an alternative utopian world he envisions. His state of delusion results in a monomaniac obsession to construct a diorama of his imagined utopia. With its combination of stop motion animation and live-action footage, The Child of the World examines what happens when a utopian impulse turns destructive.
