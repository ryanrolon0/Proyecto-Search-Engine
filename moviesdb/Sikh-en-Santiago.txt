Sikh en Santiago

 A man walks around the streets of Santiago with a turban, a long beard and a strange metal bracelet around his hand. In the street people yell "Osama", "Terrorist", but he's not any of these things. A Muslim isn't a terrorist, but he's not even a Muslim. He's a Sikh, and this is his story.
