Ugly

 Gwen is a lonely single mother with an unusual passion for knitting and living with her young daughter Lola. When photography student Kirk asks if he can photograph Gwen in her home, Gwen only agrees after Lola's prompting. Kirk has ulterior motives though, and when Gwen finds out, she sets upon taking the upper hand in the situation.
