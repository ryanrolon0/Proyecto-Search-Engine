Skol

 After 50 seasons, the Minnesota Vikings have still not won a Superbowl. Hopes were high in 2010 after the team fell one play short of the Championship game in the previous season and the highly talented roster was largely in tact to make a run once again. Well, leave it to the Vikings to disappoint. Skol remain hopeful and loyal despite the ups and downs and devastating losses of 50 seasons and whose fan-dom nurtures a set of unique skills and talents. From an artist that makes player portraits to a small business owner with a Vikings themed Bed and Breakfast - the Vikings are truly a muse for these talented Minnesotans.
