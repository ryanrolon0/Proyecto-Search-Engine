The Bear's Tale

 The bears go out for a bicycle ride while their porridge cools. Goldilocks comes along, but stops at grandmother's house instead, where the wolf is waiting. He sends her away, then realized she'd do just fine, so he rushes over to the bears house. Red gets to granny's house, finds a note from the wolf, and calls Goldy.
