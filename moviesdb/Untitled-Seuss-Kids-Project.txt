Untitled Seuss Kids Project

 When five brothers and sisters find an old book by an unnamed author, they are propelled into a world created by a cousin of their famous ancestor D. Seuss, where they come face to face with bizarre creatures, zany characters and dangerous beasts and are forced to use the family bond instilled in them at an early age to rely on each other for knowledge and bravery, in defeating challenges, staying strong and most importantly staying alive, long enough to make it home.
