The Blanket

 A grown man is addicted to his blanket. He sleeps with it, showers with it, takes it to work with him, etc. One day he loses it and his world is shattered. He searches high and low and is cast into depression. As time passes, he finds reasons to smile and enjoy life again. By the time he finds the missing blanket, he no longer needs it. He folds it and puts it away.
