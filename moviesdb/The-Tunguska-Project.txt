The Tunguska Project

 Cree playwright Floyd Favel travels from Saskatchewan to explore the Tunguska region of Russia in order to learn more about the Tunguska Event, a massive explosion that occurred there in 1908, for reasons unknown. In his journey he explores the common bonds between the Cree and the Evenki people of Tunguska, making it a journey of both historical and spiritual discovery.
