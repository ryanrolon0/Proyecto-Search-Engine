The Stem Cell Divide

 'The Stem Cell Divide' examines the controversy over embryonic stem cell research, which has galvanized the scientific, religious and political sectors throughout the United States. We show how Missourians grappled with the conflict, which transcends geography, religion, political parties, race, gender, age and socioeconomic status. Showing both sides and challenging assumptions, we explore the passions and principles of patients, citizen advocates, scientists and policy makers.
