Skate of Mind

 A short glance at the city. Modern, historic, gray, we see her from above. But there is a big underground culture that is living by the sideways at the edge of the concrete, they look at the city from the ground Skaters. They have no religion, no country, no boundaries. The concrete kids refuse to commit and take responsibility (they don't go to the army), they live together in spite of their backgrounds and they have their on language and religion Skateboard. Our hero is Mohammed Kahil, an Arab Israeli skater champion. This is his story. A modern Romeo & Juliet, love story, between him & Alina Fine ,an Israeli Jew, their struggle to love and live in times of war and their parents disapproval.
