Secrets Sins

 Kristen and Sean are a married couple who work together as licensed marriage counselors, using the therapy sessions to keep their own relationship spicy. New clients Valerie and Brad are a married couple who don't have any big problems, but want to improve their relationship. The counselors guide the couple through a sexual and relationship therapy session, discussing various topics and using stories about previous clients as examples. Kristen takes Valerie aside so that she can explore her desire to try sex with another female, and the couple later try to decide if they're ready to try a threesome.
