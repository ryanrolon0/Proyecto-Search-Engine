Scalp

 Six day hikers went hiking in the North Carolina woods, thinking they would be back in time for dinner. They were wrong. In the Lost Ravine, all paths lead to nowhere. What happened in 1825 continues to haunt the Ravine. The image of a pilgrim woman begins the horrific struggle where courage, loyalty and the will to survive are pushed to the limit.
