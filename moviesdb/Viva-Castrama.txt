Viva Castrama

 In this society the citizens receive a daily script like that of a film where they are told exactly what to think, say and do. Tow citizens scripts are mistakenly switched and delivered to the wrong individuals. This confusion exposes a fraud sting operation and even a betrayal of a father by his own son. Due to the scarcity of food and everything else in this society, everyone is out for himself. In this world, corruption begins at the top and trickles all the way down to the bottom of the food chain.
