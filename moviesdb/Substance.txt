Substance

 Zoe Miller is the idealistic, "straight-edge" 23 year-old "shoegazer" guitarist with a troubled past. To further her musical career and meet her indie rock idol, Zoe convinces her bassist boyfriend Jake Reed and slacker drummer Bill "Trippy" Hansen to play at an Austin "DIY" (Do-It-Yourself) outdoor music festival. With no money and even fewer connections, they consent to drive a jet-setting Texas billionaire's white Cadillac from New York City to Dallas through a drive-away car service and soon find themselves stranded in Dallas for 3 days and nights. Beguiled by the decadent lifestyles of their scheming Texas hosts, Zoe and the band encounter a slew of obstacles that make their passage to the music festival improbable and absurd.
