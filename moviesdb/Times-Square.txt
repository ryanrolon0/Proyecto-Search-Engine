Times Square

 Times Square is an experimental, abstract meditation on urban shapes. It was a collaboration by Jules Engel, head of the Experimental Animation Department at Cal Arts Arts and his protEgE and student, Joanna Priestley. The images were made with a keyboard on a Cubicomp and were shot onto 16 mm film by putting a Bolex on a tripod in front of the monitor.
