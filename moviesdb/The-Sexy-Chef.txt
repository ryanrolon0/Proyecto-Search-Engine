The Sexy Chef

 It's another day. It's another day at the factory, another weekend, another Friday night, and another stop at the local all night breakfast and coffee joint. F.M.'s life has cemented itself in a rut. He serves the same idiotic warehouse, he lives in the same room at his parents, and all of the same co-workers drive him nuts. But then he sees her, and his life is never the same again. She is the Sexy Chef, a woman F.M. only briefly observes smoking in a seedy alley behind a local culinary institute. Transfixed by her image, the Sexy Chef becomes F.M.'s one last hope, the guiding light on an epic road-trip. He is joined by his friends slacker, Paul, a quiet misanthrope, and Wynonna, Tank's half-sister and practicing witch. Together, they track the elusive and alluring Chef. The road is long and strange. F.M. is haunted by his old couch. The group is given direction from prankster spirits from beyond. Bizarre Saturday morning cartoon fetishes come to light. F.M. needs to be rescued from a tree while a naked metal patient throws hamburger buns at him. All the while the group stays one step behind the chef. At the end of the line, the weary travelers find themselves at a Casino, where each discovers their individual destiny. It is at the Casino that F.M. finds the Chef. Naturally, nothing goes as planned. F.M. ends up alone, stranded in the desert, without his car, or friends. However, he does finally understand what must be done.
