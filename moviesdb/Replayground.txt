 I interviewed and filmed a group of students about their first year of school. After watching the footage I picked three kids to re-enact their story of an argument that took place in the schoolyard. Combining the three stories I wrote a script. Next I hired a casting director, set-up auditions with adult actors, and brought the students in to help cast their parts. We filmed each one sitting in on the session, interviewing the actors auditioning to play them. Afterwards each child chose an actor. After casting the actors the children each had the opportunity to direct the scene at a theatre near their school. As each one directed the adults through the re-enactment of the argument the story became something entirely new.
