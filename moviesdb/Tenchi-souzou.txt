Tenchi souzou

 Ark, a young boy living in the insides of the world, comes across a sealed, hidden box and opens it, freeing a mysterious creature but freezing all life in his village, Crysta, at the same time. Crysta's Elder, the original owner of the box, sends Ark on a mission to save his town, but it eventually becomes clear that the opening of the box meant the destruction of a world - our world - that Ark must now resurrect, from continents, to life itself, and re-establish civilization. But are Ark's deeds the beginning of a new utopia or an inevitable doomsday?
