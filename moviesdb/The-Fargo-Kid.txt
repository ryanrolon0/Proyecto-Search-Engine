The Fargo Kid

 In this light comedy, the Fargo Kid rides into town on an outlaw's horse and when mistaken for him, is hired to kill a man. There is a reward for the outlaw and the Kid's pal Whoppper not realizing what has happened, alerts the Sheriff in hope of earning the reward. Thinking himself a good judge of character he even enlists the outlaw's help in the capture. In a remake of RKO's 1933 "The Cheyenne Kid" starring Tom Keene, and one of the few B-westerns played as a comedy while hanging onto the action and heroics of the standard series westerns, The Fargo Kid rides into Micaville (a favorite town name in RKO westerns) on a sorrel horse he won in a draw on the road with gunman Deuce Mallory. The horse identifies him to crooks Nick Kane and Bush Cleveland as killer-for-hire Mallory, and they promptly pay him $5000 to kill prospector Caleb Winters. Curious, the Kid goes to Winters and finds him hostile toward anyone wanting to buy his land and claim as he believes he will hit paydirt soon. Meanwhile, the real Mallory has contacted Deuce and sent him to shoot Winters on sight and get the $5000 back from the Kid. Unaware of this development, the Kid walks into Nick's trap (who can't find the money on him), and then into the hands of Sheriff Dave, who thinks he is Mallory. With the aid of his pals, Johnny and Whopper, the Kid escapes, corrals Nick and the weasel-like Bush and herds them to Winter's cabin where Bush spills the truth---Nick wants Winters killed so he can buy the land cheap from Winters' daughter Jenny and wife Sarah, as he knows Winters is only 15 feet from a rich vein. The Kid turns Nick, Bush and Mallory over to the sheriff. As he and his pals ride off, he removes the rolled-up paper money from the barrel of his gun, where he had hidden it.
