The Alley Cat

 A penthouse-dwelling society kitty finds herself attracted to the black cat serenading her from the alley. The pompous butler sends the bulldog after him, but the cat is too tricky and the dog is too easily intimidated. The alley cat eventually makes his way into the apartment where he and the rich feline dance to "La cucaracha" on the radio. The bulldog returns to continue the battle, resulting in the complete destruction of the apartment.
