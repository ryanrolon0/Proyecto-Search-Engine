Two Guys & a Van

 Half-wit con-men Andrew and Bruce live in a beat-up Volkswagen camper, traveling around and scamming people in pursuit of their life-long dreams to move to France and become a famous chef and a famous poet... but their cooking and poetry are as bad as their French. All they need is one last scam, so when they met Charlotte, a blind girl with a penchant for prescription drugs, they're sure she's the easy mark who will get them to easy street. But when the merde hits the fan, it's every man for himself in this offbeat comedy about love, friendship, and roadkill cuisine.
