Smile Jenny, You're Dead

 An ex-cop moonlighting as a private investigator looks into the murder of the son-in-law of his friend and gets involved with the victim's wife, who is his friend's daughter. Harry Orwell, an ex-San Diego cop now working as a private investigator, learns of attempts on the life of Jenny English, a model. As Orwell and the Department conduct investigations independent of one another, Harry learns about Jenny English's marriage to a military officer, and then encounters a deranged photographer who has broken into Jenny's house. When Jenny's ex-husband is found dead, Jenny sobs in Harry's arms, and her stalker, wanting no one else to have anything to do with her, vows to "purify" Jenny on a dangerous rooftop.
