Touched by Fellini

 Take one Alfonso, a romantic and passionate waiter with a warped reality. Then take Isobel, a woman whose life is at a cross-road. Stir in Rob, her distracted and ambitious boyfriend. Sprinkle some charm and flirtation from Tony. Add one fountain. Finally, garnish with Fellini's La Dolce Vita. A recipe for passion or a recipe for disaster? Sometimes a random meeting can highlight what is wrong, what is right, and what is possible in your life. Touched by Fellini.
