Profile for Murder

 A female police psychiatrist develops sexual fantasies involving a patient accused of murder. Contains nudity, simulated sex and masturbation, violence, and profanity. Adrian Cross is a ladies' man. One of his favorite hobbies is to go to night clubs and find women to have sex with. Trouble is, recently some of these women have been turning up dead. In fact, three of them are found dead in their apartments, with identical stab wounds to the backs of their necks. Cross is the prime suspect. When the police find him and take him into custody for a few days, they hire Dr. Hanna Carras, a psychiatrist, to come in and evaluate Cross - to speak with him and hopefully get some information out of him that would incriminate him in court. But she finds herself very attracted to him and has sexual fantasies about him when they're not together. Will she succumb to her wildest dreams? Will the murderer get away?
