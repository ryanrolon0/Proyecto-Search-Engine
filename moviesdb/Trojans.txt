Trojans

 Trojans manages to poke fun at the formulaic sports comedy while still having heart and its own identity. Whether it's the quarterback who doesn't believe in himself, the girlfriend who is way too good to be true, the cocky star receiver who has to deal with a lovesick stalker or the coach who has seen better days Trojans throws them all together on the day of the championship game. Can they pull it together as a team or will they fall apart on the biggest stage of all?
