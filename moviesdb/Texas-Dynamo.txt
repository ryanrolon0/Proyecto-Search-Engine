Texas Dynamo

 Stanton, backed by the citizen's peace patrol making him the only armed man in town but actually the head of a gang of crooks, has Julia Beck elected mayor as an honest front for his activities. Her father, Walt Beck, sends for Steve Drake/The Durango Kid to help fight Stanton, but Stanton has Beck killed and Durango is blamed. The Texas Dynamo, a gunman sent for by Stanton, dies on the trail and Steve rides into town posing as the Texas outlaw. He convinces Julia of Stanton's double-crossing use of the peace patrol, but not before Stanton also frames her brother, Bill Beck, for a robbery.
