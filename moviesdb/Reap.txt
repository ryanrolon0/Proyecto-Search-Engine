Reap

 A husband and wife start a life in a new home. This is the start of a new chapter in their lives, as they await the birth of a child and a family. An almost surreal happiness fills the house until a dark presence interrupts and slaughters the promise of love and life. Human nature is pushed to the edge as the line between love and hate is blurred in a single night.
