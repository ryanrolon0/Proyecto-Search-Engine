The Last Dinner

 We're somewhere in the near future. America's dissolution of capital punishment will take effect on New Year's Day. A lone inmate remains on a hallway devoid of prisoners. He's the last man the country will execute before the New Year and his claim of innocence may very well be true. His final meal exists as his only hope at freedom, survival, and exoneration. A tall-tale of a man's fight for truth and life, The Last Dinner is a story as American as apple pie.
