The Glass Jar

 A story of two men to have an insatiable appetite for arguing on any subject and pontificating on areas of which they have little or no understanding. The Glass Jar is a character driven dark comedy that lets us stand back and watch two characters, John and Tony, set for us their well thought out opinions on everything from their deepest fears to the effects of Christianity on to the sport of hockey. In the tradition of "Waiting for Godot" and "My Dinner with Adre", "The Glass Jar" is a little more than a conversation between two men, It highlights the comic insanity of uninformed beliefs.
