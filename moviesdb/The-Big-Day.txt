The Big Day

 You are cordially invited to watch the wedding of Jimmy Michael Goken and Mandy Eve Quinn. It's not your typical wedding. Only stuffed animals, dolls, a dancing chicken and a cardboard preacher will be attending. After their vows they dance to their favorite song by Barry Manilow , "Mandy". After the toast, the chicken dance, and a doll catching the garter, Jimmy has one last gift to end his greatest night of. As Jimmy excitedly carries his new bride across the threshold, he stumbles through the doorway creating a temper tantrum that will never be forgotten. Jimmy quickly responds and happily takes care of his wife's needs. Even though she loses her head for a second she forgives him and they live happily ever after. Please congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Michael Goken.
