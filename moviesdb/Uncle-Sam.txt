Uncle Sam

 Warren Etheridge, director of the Bumbershoot One Reel Film Festival, asked ten directors to make a short film on the topic "Who Is Uncle Sam?" Writer/director Ward Swan gives a comprehensive history of the historical icon while weaving themes of meat, amputation and foreign interventionism into the picture in order to create gratuitous controversy. A surprise twist keeps the audience guessing until the very end.
