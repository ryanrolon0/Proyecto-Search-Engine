War Without Winners

 An earlier edition, released by Admiral LaRocque at the Center for Defense Information in 1978, was reedited by Producer Arthur Kanegis in 1983, when he added the Paul Newman interviews. Kanegis arranged for his film to be broadcast on PBS stations, and developed a campaign to use viewer contributions to broadcast the film on top commercial TV stations across the United States. His company One Films, LLC re-released it 2009 to remind us that in an era of proliferation, nuclear war prevention is more crucial than ever. War Without Winners, hosted by Paul Newman, deals with the deadly serious issue of nuclear war in an upbeat manner, interviewing both military and CIA experts and people in the street in the US and the Soviet Union. In addition to being broadcast on PBS stations, it was broadcast in major markets across the country through an innovative distribution strategy.
