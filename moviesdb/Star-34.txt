Star 34

 A young Eastern couple fall heir to a Kansas farm, on which they must reside for a certain time in order to qualify for inheritance. Their visits to well over a hundred scenic and historical points of Kansas lead the couple to permanent residence there. Bill and Mary Asher are forced to visit Kansas as a result of an insistance in the will of Bill's Aunt Emily, who has just died. Thinking Kansas was "nowhere," they soon find that it is a great place, looking at the beautiful sides of that state. The young couple inherits a home and two estates in Kansas and, just guessing, lived happily ever after.
