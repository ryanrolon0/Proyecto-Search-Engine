Rootin' Tootin' Tenderfeet

 Two friends are out west looking for an heiress to whom they have a deed to deliver. A saloon-keeper, to whom the heiress is a damsel-in-distress and kept in bondage, gets his wife to pose as the heiress, and the two duped dopes hand her the inheritance papers. After discovering their mistake, they spend the rest of the film trying to retrieve the papers from the wife. Yes, it's a direct swipe from Laurel and Hardy's "Out West."
