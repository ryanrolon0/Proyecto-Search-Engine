The Mad Trapper

 Albert Johnson was a loner, a deadly shot who in 1932 triggered a grueling manhunt that had become an arctic legend. For over six weeks amid blizzards and numbing cold, he eluded a posse of trappers, soldiers, Indians, and the RCMP using for the first time a two-way radio and an airplane. During this northern saga, Johnson was involved in four shoot-outs, killing one and gravely wounding two others.
