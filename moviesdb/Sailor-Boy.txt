Sailor Boy

 Eileen keeps walking out of her care home to return to the Portsmouth cafe where she last saw her son as they said goodbye before he sailed off to war aboard HMS Sheffield during the Falkland Island campaign. Unable to face the tragic truth that her son died at sea, Eileen is repeatedly transported back to 1985 where she meets her son again and is finally reconciled to his fate by the intervention of her daughter who reveals a different truth.
