Suster N

 SUSTER N retells an urban legend of "suster ngesot" (a dying nurse crawling on the floor) against a backdrop of some mysterious incidents in a nursing home during Dutch occupation in West Java. Suffice to say love stories are also included. This is the director's first foray to horror genre, after previously directed one segment in "Serambi", which was selected in Un Certain Regard of Cannes Film Festival 2006. Newlyweds Sarah (Hasiholan) and Joe (Seven) wanted to reopen Villa Rose, Sarah's inherited nursing home from a Dutch raised grandmother. Her gimmick to maintain the Dutch atmosphere in the Nursing Home has attracted some senior citizens, a beautiful young nurse, Wulan (Guritno), and also her own mysterious sister-in-law (Rasti), to come along. Death is a common thing in the nursing home but Sarah believed something went wrong in Villa Rose, she had a vision of a crawling ghost in a nurse uniform. Unfortunately nobody took her seriously, even she was accused of getting insane. Sarah was all alone to solve the mystery, before it was too late.
