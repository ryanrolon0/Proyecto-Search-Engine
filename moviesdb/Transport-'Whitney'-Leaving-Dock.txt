Transport 'Whitney' Leaving Dock

 "This boat was the first one to leave for the South with troops. On board is a battalion of the 5th U.S. Infantry. She is a sidewheeler, and the churn of her wide paddles makes the white foam seethe and boil as she backs out of the dock. The constant seesaw of the walking beam on the upper deck, the moving men on board and the boiling, bubbling water all combine to make the spectacle one of much interest. The light is good and the film is an excellent one."
