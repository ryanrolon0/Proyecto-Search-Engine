Portrait As

 A visual portrait of the disabled avant garde filmmaker Stephen Dwoskin, as represented by his environment. The film is a very personal movement through Steve's past and present, as seen through the house he has lived in for the last 30 years and the objects within it that both surround and represent him- as an individual living with a disability, and as an artist-filmmaker who has enjoyed a long and successful career.
