Primitif

 Three students, Tommy, Rita, and Robert, and their guides head into the jungle to study primitive tribes separated from civilization. However, the students say the one tribe they visit isn't primitive enough, and they want to find some really savages, and to locate the legendary cannibal tribe supposedly living in the area. The guide reluctantly agrees, and they are all soon separated in a raft accident. Robert and Rita are captured by the cannibals and held prisoner, while Tommy and their guide wander aimlessly through the jungle, looking for their lost companions.
