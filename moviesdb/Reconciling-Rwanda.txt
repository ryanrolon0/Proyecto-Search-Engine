Reconciling Rwanda

 In 'Reconciling Rwanda' an American College student tells us what most Americans don't know. We meet her fellow Rwandan students who were on opposite sides of the genocide. We journey with them through the picturesque hills, chimpanzee forest and vast lake Kivu. We hear the Rwandan president speak about genocide and reconciliation. Filmed entirely in Rwanda
