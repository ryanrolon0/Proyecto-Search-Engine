Radio Caroline

 Challenging the British government's monopoly of the airwaves, young DJs take to international waters, creating "pirate" radio stations. Radio Caroline broadcasts friendly pop music programmes, rapidly gaining huge public support across Britain and throughout parts of Europe. A brother and sister, following their separate dreams, end up on opposing sides of the battle for free speech. The Sixties in Great Britain was an exciting and turbulent decade. Ambitious young men and women rejected the Establishment, defining a new way to live and love. Max Cashman, a brash young music lover is swept aboard Radio Caroline, an offshore 'pirate' radio station set up to play pop music and challenge the government's monopoly of the airwaves. Radio Caroline epitomized the emergent youth culture, redefined broadcasting, and provided the soundtrack to a social revolution. As Max's celebrity increases his older sister Clare, a smart, tenacious aide, ascends the ranks of Harold Wilson's government. When the audience for pirate radio out rates the BBC's, Clare must legislate against the pop pirates and their stations. With their principles and family bond at stake, Clare and Max are forced against each other in a struggle that will teach them the high price of free speech.
