Road Kill

 Jose wanders through the hot sun, hoping someone will give him a ride. A gas can thumps against his leg as he trudges along, mile after mile. Like a Siren, the gas can calls out to The Biker. When The Biker slows down and stops, Jose thinks his prayers have finally been answered. Little does he know... The Devil hears our prayers as well.
