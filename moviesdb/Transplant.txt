Transplant

 Hurricane Katrina caused the greatest mass migration since the dust bowl, and while leaving only took a day, rebuilding a life in a new place takes much, much longer. The short documentary Transplant chronicles two such uprooted women challenged and the other her caretaker through the state of Louisiana. After evacuating New Orleans to escape Hurricane Katrina, both struggle to form a new life in a small town in Texas. While Vonda, the caretaker, and her children are having a hard time adjusting, they are learning a lot from Tanya, her client, who has overcome all challenges to pursue selling Avon products door-to-door. Tanya, who is without a family of her own, is learning to be a part of Vonda's family. Both learn to redefine their definitions of family and home.
