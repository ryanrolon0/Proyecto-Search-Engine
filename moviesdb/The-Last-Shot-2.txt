The Last Shot 2

 A year ago, Detective Jack Carter saved his wife from kidnappers, even after she was presumed dead. Now, Thomas Logan, one of the kidnappers is back and is bombing buildings in the city. Jack is called in by his ex-partner Dan Evans to find out what exactly is going on. With David Griffin (Josh Arms) recently paroled from prison, Jack doesn't know what exactly is going on. With danger around every turn, Jack proceeds to find Griffin and stop Logan before he strikes again.
