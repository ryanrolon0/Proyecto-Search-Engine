The Shaman & Ayahuasca

 As interest grows in the psychoactive visionary brew Ayahuasca (the Mother of all 'teacher plants') so does the question of how to explain this mysterious phenomenon to the uninitiated seeker. Filmmaker Michael Wiese's latest documentary, meets this challenge with remarkable grace. In mind-bending portraits of jaguar-skinned shamans enshrouded by seeing-eye vines, the spiritual alchemy between man and nature that takes place in the ayahuasca realms is magically revealed. Enchanting interactions in Peru with curandero Don Jose Campos and visionary artist Pablo Amaringo, recorded only months before his untimely death, are among the film's brightest highlights. A deeply introspective story of healing and discovery.
