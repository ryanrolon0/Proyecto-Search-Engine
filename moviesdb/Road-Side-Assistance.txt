Road Side Assistance

 A happy couple soon will face a tragic circumstance on their tenth year anniversary. This tragic situation changes the scope of things as Matthew Brenner seeks revenge while trying to find answers to why this terrible event happened. As Matthew digs deeper to search for a valid reason so does his supposedly belated wife Pauly. Later on, we discover that Pauly was only living Matthew's image, acting like him, and following through on her belated husband. The more people sought for roadside assistance, the more deadly was the reason to kill.
