The Massey's

 A two-part made for televison movie tracing the history of a Canadian Methodist family's climb to world-wide industrial prominence. Beginning in 1847 Hart Massey, an immigrant to Upper Canada (Ontario) takes over a bankrupt iron foundry and eventually turns it into the Massey-Harris (Massey-Ferguson) farm machinery corporation.
