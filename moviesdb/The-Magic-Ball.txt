The Magic Ball

 Children offer us a magical and creative insight into their world. This film celebrates children from many different places around the world - Bali, Czech Republic, Mexico, USA, India, France, the Caribbean and Australia. Our hosts, Ashlee and Ayden are guided by the magician, Shamani Azu in their travels around the world where they witness the dancing, music and adventure these children offer.
