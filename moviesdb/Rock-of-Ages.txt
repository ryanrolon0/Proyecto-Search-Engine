Rock of Ages

 We here introduce for the first time, a sublime religious subject, illustrating one of the best known hymns extant. A beautiful girl is seen clinging to a rock, over which huge billows are dashing, sending great volumes of spray and surf high into the air. As the maiden appears to be exhausted and about to give up in utter despair, a cross appears on the rock, showing at first thinly, but gradually growing clear until it stands out in bold relief. The maiden then takes new courage and throwing her arms about the cross, clings to it in safety, while the waves continue to surge against her.
