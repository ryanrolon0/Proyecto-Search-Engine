 Where should that chair stand? A man moves it around the room, tries a few different places, to finally decide. He's desperate and wants to escape this life with the most drastic measure be just perfect. Is that rope okay that way? It seems so, still there is doubt. When the moment is really near, the chair is very shaky, a mouse crosses the room. A meow sounds.
