Spectacle! Artifice! Jiggling!

 SPECTACLE! ARTIFICE! JIGGLING! is a film about high fashion, Jell-O and urban isolation. It depicts a world of eerie, affluent environments in which absurd, inscrutable mechanisms of cosmopolitan society mutate spontaneously, transforming bourgeois politeness into a highly bizarre, almost ritualistic, aesthetic experience.
