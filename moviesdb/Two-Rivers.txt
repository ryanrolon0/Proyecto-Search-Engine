Two Rivers

 TWO RIVERS is the story of Karna, a man seeking truth and redemption along two mythic journeys, one of the past when Karna is twelve and in search for his father along the Ganges River in India, the other of the present when he is thirty and disenchanted with his life as a Chicago cab driver. When the present Karna is convinced by a blues musician to embark on a pilgrimage down the Mississippi River, he begins to see the parallel course of this journey with that of his past, while a certain prophecy attached to his birth begins to unfold.
