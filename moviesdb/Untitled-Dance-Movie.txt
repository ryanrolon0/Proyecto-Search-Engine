Untitled Dance Movie

 Hot. Sultry. Seductive. It's summertime in the blue collar vacation town of Myrtle Beach. Charming hustler and gifted dancer Harry is the cool object of admiration and attention among girls and guys alike at the local hangout, the beach dance pavilion. One night on his own, Harry happens on the incredible new sounds and moves happening at a local black nightclub, where the likes of a young James Brown and Ike Turner are performing under the watchful eye of the respected club owner, Charlie. Harry bonds with a beautiful black dancer at the club, Shag, whose raw, sensual dance moves are like nothing Harry has ever seen. Harry takes the moves back to the dance pavilion, scandalizing the adults and thrilling the local youth, who've never seen or heard anything like it. Harry's friends wonder where he's learning this incredible new dance, and decide to follow him one night. Peering through the windows of the club, they're amazed at what they see and hear, and want to join in. Gradually more and more local kids, including Harry's summer love and daughter of the local lumber magnate, Marlene, are seduced by the provocative beats and moves happening at the club. Black and white youth come together in a celebration of music, freedom and sensuality, triggering long-simmering conflicts between parents and kids; rising tensions between local townspeople and Charlie; and the shifting passions of young love. All amidst the explosive environment of a new sound and movement that would soon sweep the world.
