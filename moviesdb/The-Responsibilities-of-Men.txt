The Responsibilities of Men

 The Responsibilities of Men chronicles the daily life of the last man on earth, still trapped in the mundane rituals of his former life. Unable to cope with the terrible realities of the world around him, he chooses to blind himself by engaging in the meaningless traditions of a former world. He delivers a persuasive monologue on the merits of routine, obligation, and conformity which ironically contrasts his reality and serves to highlight the futility of his charade. As the humor wanes we see the true sadness of a man too afraid of the truth to face it. Choosing a comfortable lie over the heartbreaking truth, he condemns himself to repeat his mistakes forever.
