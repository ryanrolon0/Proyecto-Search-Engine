Trial by Trigger

 The Fallon lumber company is after California's redwood trees but logger Bill Cardigan who wants to save the trees is in the way. Cardigan has a note due at the bank and needs to get a large supply of logs to the mill. He sends his logs down the river so Fallon builds a dam to stop him. As Cardigan sets dynamite to blow up the dam, Fallon arrives to stop him. A 20-minute remake of 1938's "Valley of the Giants" with most of the original stars and players clearly shown in some of the stock footage used from "Valley of the Giants"---anything involving logging scenes, barroom brawls, train wrecks,street scenes, mass extras, etc. The few minutes of new footage---possibly half of the film---consists mostly of dialogue exchanges between the billed actors; Robert Shayne, Cheryl Walker, Warner Anderson and Ralph Dunn costumed to match the leading players---Wayne Morris, Claire Trevor, Charles Bickford and Alan Hale--- of the source film. The few scenes in which Wayne Morris is clearly visible are easy to spot as Bill Cardigan's hair turns from black to blonde. Plot line and most of the character names are the same as in the original feature-length version. A couple of shots from "Gold Is Where You Find It" are also used, and both Wade Boteler and Cliff Saum, who died in 1943, are in this 1944 production via stock footage.
