Seasons

 A love story that follows one couple from 1949 until the present. It has personal meaning for me as the main characters are based loosely off my grandparents, parents, and my own marriage. Anyone who is or ever has been in love with someone can tell you that love changes like the seasons. There is the spring when the love is fresh and exciting. The summer, when the love is warm and you immerse yourself in it. The fall, when the excitement has worn off, the winter, which is the darkest of seasons. Eventually we all come back around to the Spring, when it is about the love and happiness again. This film follows Ricky and Sherry through those seasons and back again.
