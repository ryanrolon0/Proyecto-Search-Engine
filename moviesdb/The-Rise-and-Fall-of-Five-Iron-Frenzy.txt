The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy

 Hailing from Denver Colorado, this group of underdogs ascended to become both adored and despised for their nine albums and almost 1000 live performances. Riding the fence between a Christian fad and a secular phenomenon, Five Iron Frenzy never quite belonged in either world. This is the story of how nine people rose to have one of the greatest cult followings of any band in recent history, and of their subsequent demise. More fun than a piñata full of pork and beans - the rise and fall of Five Iron Frenzy.
