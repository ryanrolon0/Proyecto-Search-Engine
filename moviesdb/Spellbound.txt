Spellbound

 When a wizard's apprentice is tricked into a magical wood by a fairy, he emerges in New York City, where he must master his magic to return home. Shot without trick photography or special effects to accomplish the magic in the film, Spellbound uses magicians instead of actors, accomplishing the magic in the narrative with legerdemain, not ILM.
