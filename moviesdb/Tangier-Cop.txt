Tangier Cop

 Yaasin, a policeman from Tangier who has almost become an alcoholic, spends most of his time in an exclusive brothel. Several characters arrive in the city at the same time Miller who, with her little daughter Gudrun, makes herself a living by doing frauds and small thefts; the smart gangster Rustum Wadi who is looking for a talisman that at that moment is in the hands of Andrews, a homosexual British collector. Yaasin is supposed to protect Burns, but when Andrew's corpse appears the case takes an unexpected turn.
