The Whole Nine Yards

 Oz is a MontrEal dentist, paying off debts so he can divorce his wife dislike is mutual. When she learns their new neighbor is hit man Jimmy the Tulip, with a price on his head, she sends Oz to Chicago to earn a finder's fee telling Mob boss Yanni where to find Jimmy. To get his wife off his back, Oz goes, his assistant Jill urging him to get laid while there. One of Yanni's men awaits Oz at the hotel; Oz's now in too deep to avoid telling Yanni what he knows. Meanwhile, Oz's wife rats on Oz to Jimmy, hoping Jimmy will kill Oz and she can cash in on life insurance. Oz meets Jimmy's wife (Yanni's captive), flips for her, and the double-crosses mount. Even Jill isn't whom she seems. A miserable suburban dentist in Canada is terrified when he finds out a former mob hitman from Chicago has moved next door to him. When he tells his greedy wife, however, she forces him to go to Chicago and try to sell the hitman's location to the mobsters he betrayed. Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a mob hitman-turned-informant, ratted on the mob and put his life in jeopardy. Now he has moved to suburban Montreal, ostensibly to make a new start. His next-door neighbor is mild-mannered, unhappily married dentist Nick 'Oz' Oseransk. Nick recognizes Jimmy from the newspaper stories about his mob testimony, and that's when Nick's simple, boring world turns upside down. Well, there goes the neighborhood - in a pine box. When hit man Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski moves into a comfy suburb, everyone's suddenly in danger of pushing up daisies. And it's not all Jimmy's doing, either sparks a chain reaction in which just about everybody wants to clip somebody else. There's a hapless dentist who finds a way to get on the Tulip's good and bad sides.
