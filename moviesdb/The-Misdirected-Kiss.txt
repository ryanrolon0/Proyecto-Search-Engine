The Misdirected Kiss

 A near-sighted beau brings some flowers to a pretty girl. She leaves the room for an instant and a colored maid enters and proceeds to arrange the flowers. The near-sighted chap at once seizes her hand and proceeds to cover it with kisses, much to the amazement of the maid and of the mistress, who in the meantime has returned.
