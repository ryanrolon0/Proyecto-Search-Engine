Revue um Mitternacht

 Despite the fact that production manager Kruse doesn't have the actors or the crew for the job, he recklessly boasts that he could direct a review film. To prevent him losing face, Kruse brings together four people - a dramaturg, a composer, a writer and an architect - and gives them the thankless task of turning his idea into a film. Except for the relatively unknown composer Alexander Ritter, who is enthusiastically committed to the project, the other members of the team find themselves stuck in this mess. The production assistant Claudia Glueck and the rest of the team don't count on Ritter at first because he has absolutely no experience in composing material for review films. But what he lacks in experience, he more than makes up with his creative energy and his enthusiasm for the project. Not only are all of his colleagues' doubts soon cast aside, but Ritter also wins Glueck's heart, even though she mistrusted him the most from the very beginning. How could the review help but be a roaring success?
