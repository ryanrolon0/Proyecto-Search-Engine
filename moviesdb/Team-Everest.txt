Team Everest

 "Team Everest trekkers on an expedition to the world's highest mountain. If they succeed in their quest, the team will be the largest group of people with disabilities ever to reach Mount Everest Base Camp. Five men in wheelchairs and their teammates-representing a range of disabilities-trek 21 days through the high Himalaya. From their departure in the Sherpa village of Lukla, the team will attempt to reach an altitude of over 17,500 feet in one of the most inaccessible regions on earth. A Nepali support team is engaged to help push, pull, and carry members over the rugged, steep terrain. In this part of the world, the altitude and intense cold can stop even the most experienced hikers in their tracks. Yet if the team reaches Base Camp, expedition leader and amputee, Gary Guller, will make a bid for the summit of Everest. With stunning footage from the kingdom of Nepal, "Team Everest" offers a heartwarming story of personal ambition, as it dares us to reach beyond our perceived limitations and explores our unlimited capacity to dream.
