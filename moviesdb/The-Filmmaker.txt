The Filmmaker

 Mark is a filmmaker. He's head over heels in love with Jess but she thinks he's an idiot. She might be right. The Filmmaker follows Mark's laughable exploits in romance and moviemaking, from his innocent youth with a Super 8 camera to his accidental forays into artistic adult content. His vast array of films span animated holy muffins, post-apocalyptic zombies, tender coming of age stories and sci-fi film noir thrillers. Mark has tried his hapless hand at every genre known to cinema, and what he lacks in talent he makes up for with sheer, all-consuming optimism. But his happy existence is thrown into turmoil when his darling Jess runs off to New York with his best friend Mike. Can his prolific filmmaking console him? Can he win back the girl of his dreams? Will he ever make a good film? One filmmaker's quest for the truth, the girl, and the laurels of official selection.
