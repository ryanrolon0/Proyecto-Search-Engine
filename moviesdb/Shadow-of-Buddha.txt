Shadow of Buddha

 In the Shadow of Buddha takes us to the seldom seen world of Tibetan Buddhist Nuns in northernmost India. Many Buddhists believe that one cannot attain enlightenment in the body of a woman, so what compels these women to dedicate their lives to being a nun? Through their own voice we explore the paradox that being a woman within Tibetan Buddhism represents. For these women the notion that a woman can be educated and that being born a female is not a punishment of past deeds is currently challenging thousands of years of history. The stark images seem as familiar as they are exotic, but there is a world more beautiful and mysterious that is not often witnessed by the eye of western enthusiasm.
