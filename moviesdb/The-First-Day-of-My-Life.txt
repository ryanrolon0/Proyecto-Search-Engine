The First Day of My Life

 Laura leaves home to start a new life with her French-Canadian crush, leaving her little sis Kate to cover for her - and deal with her own feelings of abandonment. Both are thus initiated into an adult world where happiness comes at the cost of innocence. The First Day of My Life toys with taboos while maintaining a nostalgia for sisterhood.
