Tube Poker

 This is Poker with a difference - cards are replaced by people. Whether male or female, young or old, everyone is worth a certain value. The game can be played by two opposing players on any train with five seats in a row. Originating in Japan in the late 80's as "Subway Poker" and tightly controlled by crime syndicates, the game has subsequently spread to many major cities around the world.
