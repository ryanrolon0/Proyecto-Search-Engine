Surviving Sounds of Haida

 A few of the remaining Haida elders from Kasaan, Alaska share some of their endangered language. They give the English meanings to many Haida words and phrases. One of the most fluent speakers, Erma Lawrence, 95, reads one of her Haida poems. At the end, Erma sings "How Great Thou Art" in Haida.
