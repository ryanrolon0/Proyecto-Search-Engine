Them!

 Nuclear tests in the desert result in the growth of gigantic mutant ants who menace cities in the American south-west as a team of investigators and the army search for a way to control their spread in this Cold War-era monster film. After several people in the New Mexico desert wind up missing or dead, including an F.B.I. agent and most of his family, police Sgt. Ben Peterson teams up with F.B.I. agent Bob Graham to find out what's causing the strange occurrences. They find send a strange print found at one of the crime scenes and it is sent to the Department of Agriculture. Doctor Harold Medford and his daughter Doctor Patricia Medford arrive and ask to be taken to the scene of some of the disappearances. When they get there they are shocked to find gigantic ants, whose mutations were caused by the first atomic bomb explosion nine years earlier. They manage to destroy the nest of ants, but not before two winged queen ants and a couple of drones have hatched and escaped the nest. Now it is a race against time to find the two queen ants before they can establish more nests and hatch more queens. Police Sgt. Ben Peterson finds a little girl wandering aimlessly in the New Mexico desert and they trace her to the family's camping trailer a few miles away. There is no sign of her parents and the trailer itself has been badly damaged. Soon after, Peterson's partner and the owner of a general store are also killed. They're not sure what they have on their hands but are soon joined by FBI Agent Robert Graham and two doctors from the Department of Agriculture, Harold Medford and his daughter Pat. They discover that there is a nest of giant mutated ants resulting from the atomic tests in the desert 10 years before. They don't quite manage to kill all of them however and the ants migrate to Los Angeles and establish a nest in the vast subterranean sewer system.
