Prince of Wales Leaving Marlborough House to Attend an Investure

 "This is a splendid picture of the King (then the Prince of Wales) leaving Marlborough House, in the royal carriage. The King is uniformed as Field-Marshal of the British Army, and is accompanied by a suite and an escort of the Horse Guards. This is one of the best portraits of the King ever made."
