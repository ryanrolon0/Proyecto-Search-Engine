One night during a drunken argument with his sister, he is stopped from attacking her by a young woman who lives across the hall. Angry at first, he comes to admire the woman for sticking up for someone she didn't know. Soon he decides to turn over a new leaf, and he stops drinking and brawling and gets a job. Soon he finds himself in a position where he must return to his old ways in order to save the young woman who changed his life.
