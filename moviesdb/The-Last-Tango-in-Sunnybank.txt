The Last Tango in Sunnybank

 Lucy knows what her mum wants, maybe even mum will find out what that is. The Last Tango in Sunnybank explores a woman's search for the lost passion in her life. She is wryly observed by her twelve year old daughter who as a way of coping with her situation merges reality with fantasy by creating a semi fictitious character of her mother. Always hopeful she shares her mothers romantic inclinations but has her own agenda.
