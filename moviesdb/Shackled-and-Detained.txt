Shackled and Detained

 Juana Villegas was 9 months pregnant and never pictured herself as a mom to be behind bars. She was taken in for a routine traffic violation that is normally taken care of by a simple citation. This violation, of which she was later cleared, was handled by immigration authorized local police and she was locked up in a jail in her state. Taken to the hospital in chains, she went through labor with a sheriff's officer standing guard in her hospital room, where one of her feet was cuffed to the bed most of the time. She talks of her pain after giving birth.
