 Based on an original recording found by the writer-philosopher Jean Paul Sartre in 1967 in which a patient confronts his psychologist after a long therapy that has given him no results. The tension mounts while the doctor wants to get rid of the patient but he's afraid the patient, who is a lawyer, could use the recording as an evidence of the psychologist's methods.
