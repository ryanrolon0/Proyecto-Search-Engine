Sundancing with the Muse

 We discover the importance of the sacred in art, the sacred in the earth and a ceremonial life that makes them one. Artist and shaman Heyoka Merrifield, exposes his personal and creative journey that reveals the source of creativity and the roots of imagination. In looking at the medicine wheel of his story and his grasp of the interplay between our world and the world of spirits, a path is illuminated and we realize we each have a gift to give away to the circle of life, making our walk on earth a sacred journey.
