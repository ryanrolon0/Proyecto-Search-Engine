The Naked Gun 2½

 Lt. Frank Drebbin returns to save the day once again. This time he's out to foil the "big boys" in the energy business. A top scientist (Dr Mainheimer) is about to publish his report on energy supply for the future. Things don't look good for the traditional suppliers; oil, coal and nuclear. To save their industries, the suppliers kidnap Mainheimer and replace him with a decoy with a more favourable report. Jane, the Dr's secretary, is Drebbin's old flame; they're passionate love affair is thus rekindled. Lt. Frank Drebin loves a mystery. Why are we here? Is there life after sex? Yes, Drebin tackles the big issues--and the biggest of all is how to stop devious Quentin Hapsburg's plan to destroy the environment! Returning are Jane, the woman who can melt a cheese sandwich from 20 paces; the intrepid Capt. Ed Hocken; and the man so famous a beverage is named after him, as hard-luck cop Nordberg.
