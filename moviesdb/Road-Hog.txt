Road Hog

 It's morning, and the carrot-topped Angry Kid is off for a ride on his bicycle, right down the middle of a lane of traffic. As the day goes on and night falls, various drivers try to get him to move over so they can pass. The Kid stays in the middle of the road. As time passes, will an angry driver take him out, or will something else bring down the lad?
