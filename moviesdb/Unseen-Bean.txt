Unseen Bean

 That incorigable Mr. Bean is back! First, he's attending an open house day at school where he raises an uproar in art class, and wreaks havoc on the science lab. Next, Mr. Bean inadvertantly becomes a barber's assistant then enters Teddy in the county fair pet show and finally, Mr. Bean is sent to Moscow by post.
