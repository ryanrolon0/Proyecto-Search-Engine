The Medallion of Man

 A boy, Mike, is unlucky with the ladies, entering his Junior year of high school, until he comes across an ancient medallion called The Medallion of Man with the power to make any woman fall instantly in love with the man bearing it. Life is great for Mike until the medallion is stolen and other obstacles bring Mike away from his true self. With the help of his best friend, Chuck, and conquering personal obstacles, he recognizes that the best kind of love is what comes from the inside, not what the Medallion provides and only then does he get the girl he always wanted.
