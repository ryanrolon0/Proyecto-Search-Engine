The Adventures of Ragtime

 Ragtime is a miniature pet horse and the kids love him. But villains Sam and Lester think Ragtime can be their meal ticket. They kidnap the horse for ransom. The family is worried but before you can say "Home Alone", Ragtime out-smarts the bad guys who are then happy to be hauled off to prison.
