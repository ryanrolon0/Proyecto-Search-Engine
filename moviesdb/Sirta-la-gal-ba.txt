Sirta la gal ba

 Mam Baldar is a very unusual postman, who, for many years, has traveled among the mountainous villages of Iraqi Kurdistan recording and delivering people's messages. One day, a partisan commander asks him to make a recording of his newborn child's first cry. Mam sets off to find the commander's village and, once there, is informed that all the children in the area, as well as the commander's pregnant wife, have been evacuated to a far-off valley. With steely determination, Mam at once heads out for the valley.
