The Treble

 United lost the premiership to Arsenal in the 97/98 season. They were also defeated in the pre-season Charity Shield match at Wembley, by the same team. Yet, United managed to win the premiership (Arsenal finished 2nd), the F.A. Cup (2-0 in the final against Newcastle) and to make it even better, Manchester United, who were 1-0 down after Mario Basler's freekick in the beginning of the game, scored 2 quick goals in added time (1-1 Teddy Sheringham, 2-1 Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer) and win the most prestigeous title of them all - The European Cup Title!
