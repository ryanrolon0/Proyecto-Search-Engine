Sheoeyin Kenna

 A reflection on the destinies of comrades who were once bound by ideologies and remain tightly knit friends, We Were Communists an uninhibited examination of the legacy of Lebanon's civil war and its post-war present. Four men recount their stories from the battlefield, their broken dreams, and their eventual disillusionment in light of the country's unsettled crises. Artistically and politically audacious, incisive and tender, the film travels the chimeric and daunting reality of Lebanon's fractured post-war landscape. As sectarian leaders continue to strengthen their hold over political discourse, the film poses serious questions regarding the country's future.
