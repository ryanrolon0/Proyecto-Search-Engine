The One Stop Shop

 This story is about a history teacher who has come to the bleak conclusion that his existence is worthless. However, unlike the fearless war heroes and immortal generals he teaches about, Henry simply does not have the self-confidence to go on or the courage to pull the trigger himself, so he stages a convenience store robbery in the hopes that the cops arrive to shoot him first. Things go awry when one of his students Tracy, and her half-wit, punk boyfriend, Brad come into the store at the wrong time and find themselves inextricably involved in Henry's suicide plot. The teens along with the unsuspecting clerk, Kevin, are faced with the terrifying job of talking him out of it before it's too late.
