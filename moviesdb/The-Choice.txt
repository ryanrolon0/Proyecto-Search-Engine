The Choice

 Late one evening, just before closing her French restaurant and jazz club in Chicago, Vera meets Paul, who claims her husband, Tim, owes him a large sum of money. After Vera explains that Tim died a year ago in a car accident, Paul leads Vera back in time where she confronts the mystery of her husband's death. But, for Vera, a suspicion lurks or is it just a great performance by a sinister con-artist?
