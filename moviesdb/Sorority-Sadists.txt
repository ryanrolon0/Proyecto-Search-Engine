Sorority Sadists

 Co-ed KATIE JORDON is having serious problems with her new roommate VANESSA. The girl borrows her clothes without asking, doesn't clean up after herself, and even went so far as to steal her hair brush. When KATIE goes to A.J. KHAN, the president of her sorority, for help, the two girls plot the appropriate disciplinary action against the unrepentant vixen. A college student is having problems with her roommate, who takes her clothes without asking, leaves the room a mess and steals things from her. She complains to the president of her sorority about the girl, and the two of them devise a plan to teach the slovenly co-ed a lesson she won't soon forget.
