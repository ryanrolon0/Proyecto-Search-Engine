The Last Man in Brooklyn

 The year is 2012 The world has torn itself apart with nuclear weapons. The remaining vestiges of human life cling to survival like a scared child to mother's hand. In what's left of Brooklyn, New York, two men live a lonely coexistence. One is scarred by the searing radiation of atomic bombs, the other a miraculously unscathed drifter bent on cruelty for his own foul pleasure. Then... SHE came along. The bitter love triangle that ensued is as timeless as a stopped watch, and as tragic as a dead puppy.
