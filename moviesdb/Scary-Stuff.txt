Scary Stuff

 Scary Stuff is an enjoyable romp about two brothers who decide to play a prank on their unsuspecting sister one night after the parents have gone out. Putting their new toy monsters to good use they plot to scare their sister off her rocker and off the phone. But, turnabout is fair play and when the toys appear to come to life, the boys realize scary stuff is not as much fun as it seems.
