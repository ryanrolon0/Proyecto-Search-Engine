The Stain

 In a house on a cliff by the sea, a man and a woman live together and eventually have children. When the mother disappears and the father goes for a swim in the sea, the baby is left to be raised by the twin brothers and the cruel, older sister. When they grow up secrets can only be kept for so long.
