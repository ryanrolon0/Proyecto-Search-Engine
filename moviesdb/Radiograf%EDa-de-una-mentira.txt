Radiografía de una mentira

 "The revolution will not be televised" is a propaganda film designed to distort the Venezuelan reality. Its authors used the good faith and patronage of recognized European TV Corporations as the BBC, RTE, ZDF, NPS/Cobo, Arte and YLE. "X Rays of a lie" shows the grave omissions,informative bias and direct lies of the film.
