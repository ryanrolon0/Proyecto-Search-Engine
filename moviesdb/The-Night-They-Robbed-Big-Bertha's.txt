The Night They Robbed Big Bertha's

 Big Bertha is the popular, full-figured owner of the community's most successful whorehouse and moonshine racketeering enterprise. Some guys decide to rob the place, the local cops just happen to coincidentally be "visiting" the girls, moonshine is discovered, slapstick ensues.
