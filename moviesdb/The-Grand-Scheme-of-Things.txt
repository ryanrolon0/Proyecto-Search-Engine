The Grand Scheme of Things

 Ten years ago, Simone Rovelle lost her twin sister to a rare heredity disease. Since that time she has dedicated her life to finding cures and saving lives. Unfortunately, her young daughter has been diagnosed with the same disease that claimed her sister's life. Over the past three years, she and her bio-medical engineer partner (Brooks Avery) have been working to find a cure to save her daughter's life. On the brink of discovering a treatment, federal funding for the project has been cut and she's ordered to cease working of the project. Knowing that her daughter's life depends on this cure, Simone devises a plan involving a young lottery winner (Randy Baxter) to conjure up the funds needed to continue the research. However, all is not what they may seem to be, in the Grand Scheme of Things. The Grand Scheme of Things ......... love lies money murder
