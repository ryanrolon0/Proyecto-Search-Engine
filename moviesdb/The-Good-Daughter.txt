The Good Daughter

 Ashleigh's father Denton is absorbed by his pleasures. Though still a girl, she dutifully hunts, cooks and cleans for him, dreaming of an impassioned, sophisticated life, far from the shadows and rust of the rural South. Her room is her private space to explore her fantasies, thoughts and feelings, though one day Denton spies her toying with her femininity. Afraid her burgeoning womanhood spells the end of his dominance, Denton seeks divine intervention, forcing Jesus into her life, but she resists. Feigning injury, Denton succeeds in keeping Ashleigh at home, the old cycles creep back into the house and all hope seems lost. One day Ashleigh discovers his deceit and escapes the house to try follow her dreams.
