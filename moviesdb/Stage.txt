Stage

 The film follows two young students in their final year of school. They are told they must decide what they want to do for the rest of their lives. The film follows them making their choices, and dealing with their confusion. This film was made for my final year of school for an art project. I chose this subject because I believe too much pressure is put on students when they have to decide what to do after school.
