The Poet

 Tired of the daily grind, meek office drone Paul Keswick decides to try a new look. Almost immediately, his life takes a turn for the unexpected as he is routinely mistaken for literary rock star David Hawk. Initially intoxicated by the attention, his experience soon turns to horror after a chance encounter with the man he pretends to be and the dead woman he is suspected of murdering. Can Paul Keswick prove his true identity in time, and is everything really what it appears to be?
