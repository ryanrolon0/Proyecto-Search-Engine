Rookies in Burma

 Even in the jungles of Burma, U.S. Army Privates Jerry Miles ('Wally Brown (I)' (qv)), and Mike Strager ('Alan Carney' (qv), are still spending most of their time on KP (Kitchen Police) duty. But they are captured by the Japanese and taken to a prison camp and discover that their long-suffering Sergeant Burke ('Erford Gage' (qv)0 has also been captured. They manage to escape into the jungle and find their way to a Burmanese village in which two American showgirls, Janie ('Joan Barclay' (qv) and Connie ('Claire Carleton' (qv), who have escaped from Shanghia, are stranded. The fivesome borrow an elephant and head for India.
