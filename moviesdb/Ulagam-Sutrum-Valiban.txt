Ulagam Sutrum Valiban

 MGR plays a double role as a scientist and his modern-swashbuckler brother trying to protect the world from a gang of evil doers led by scientist/entrepreneur Ashokan, trying to steal a formula to make bombs out of lightning. Jarring camera work, peeling make-up, truly old leading-men, and some fabulous kitsch in this second MGR directorial venture. Must-see for MGR fans, but a fair warning of 3-hours of extreme actor adulation for those new to MGR films.
