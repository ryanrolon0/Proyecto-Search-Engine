Sex and the USA

 Thirteen year old Audrey Shaw is new to Bellweather, California and certain she'll never fit in when she meets Krista Rich, the pretty, popular girl she aspires to be "or be with" - she's just not sure. Set against the backdrop of abstinence education and presented as Audrey's real life documentary assembled entirely from her own video clips, instant messages and cell phone cam (as well as those of her classmates and internet friends), Sex and The U.S.A. is a scripted drama about two teenage girls torn between Americas popular culture, where twelve year olds bear skin, breast implants are a Sweet Sixteen gift and George W. Bush's Evangelical right prizes virginity. Where natural urges of adolescence are at best dismissed, at worst, demonized and either way, taught in public schools. Without sex education or parents who are willing to talk about sex, Audrey and Krista are faced with a difficult task like whores. Like many American girls, this quest leads them to do almost anything in the name of being popular - everything in fact, except having intercourse. Their behavior escalates until ultimately, combined with confusion, results in the forced loss of the only thing thats important to Krista " her virginity", and the only thing thats important to Audrey " their friendship".
