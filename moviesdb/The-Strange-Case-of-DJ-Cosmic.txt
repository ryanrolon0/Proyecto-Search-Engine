The Strange Case of DJ Cosmic

 One man leaves, another returns, the hero's journey. An extraordinary man reflects on his life, work and the love of his estranged wife and reluctant son, not eager to take the journey. The man's reality is haunted by a past of fascination and ambition, told through the reflections of sirens in five languages and international locations. A multi-part nonlinear narrative, music-driven and based on beat-poetics, is represented as a portal network. Inspired by Carolyn Cassady's Off the Road Kerouac and Ginsberg.
