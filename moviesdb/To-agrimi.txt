To agrimi

 A lively girl, Kakia, works to help her sick mother, but her rebellious character brings her into frequent conflict with her bosses. Friction with the snooty and aloof Maro is the pretense for her being fired; in this way, however, she attracts the interest of Andreas, Maro's wealthy fiancE. Andreas falls in love with her and is willing to help her find a job as a model, but he gets into trouble, since he is dealing with an untamed creature who isn't easily dazzled by glamor and possessions. Maro, of course, on her side, does anything she can to break up their relationship, but doesn't succeed, and the love of Kakia and Andreas survives to a happy ending.
