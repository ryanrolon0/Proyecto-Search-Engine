Up Late

 The story of a young girl, Kaylee, who wants to stay up until her father gets home. But her tired stepmother, Vanessa, just wants some peace in quiet. What Vanessa doesn't know is that its more than just a restless young girl keeping them both up all night. 'Up Late' is an imagining of the old 'monster in the closet' tale. But with a bit of a twist. The end leaves our audience with many unanswered questions.
