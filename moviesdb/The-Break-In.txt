The Break-In

 On a weekday morning like any other, a man and woman stake out a house waiting for the owner to leave. As soon as he does, the woman jumps out the car and breaks into the house. She makes her way to the bedroom, filling a large bag as she goes. But then, the owner returns, catching her in the act. She freezes. The owner steps forward, his hand raised... And strokes her face. She looks up at him and they almost kiss. The guy from the car stands in the doorway. The woman pulls away from the owner and takes off her wedding ring. She places it in the owner's hand and leaves with her new man. But is she sure that she made the right choice?
