Tannhäuser

 Tannhäuser (tenor) is sick of the sensual pleasures of the Venusberg and longs for the simple joys of earthly life. The love goddess Venus (soprano) summons a magic grotto and tempts him to surrender to ecstasy, but Tannhäuser invokes the Virgin Mary and Venus disappears. Hermann (bass), the Landgrave of Thuringia, and minstrels approach. Wolfram says that in their earlier song-contests, Tannhäuser won the love of Elisabeth (soprano), the Landgrave's niece. Going to the Hall of Song, Tannhäuser throws himself at Elisabeth's feet. They sing together of love. The Landgrave announces a new song contest; the winner will receive his prize from Elisabeth herself. Wolfram (baritone) sings first and uses the image of a fountain to sing of the purity of love. The audience enjoys his song, but Tannhäuser retorts that the fountain of love fills him only with burning desire. Another minstrel, Biterolf (bass), speaks on behalf of the outraged knights and ladies when he challenges Tannhäuser to a combat. Tannhäuser mocks Biterolf's inexperience in the joys of true love. Wolfram attempts to calm everyone down, but Tannhäuser sings a hymn to Venus. The knights want to kick Tannhäuser's butt, but Elisabeth begs them to forgive him, and Tannhäuser falls to the ground with a cry of grief. The Landgrave tells Tannhäuser that his only hope of salvation is to join the band of pilgrims preparing to make their way to Rome. However, when the pilgrims return, Elisabeth sees that Tannhäuser is not among them. When Tannhäuser returns, he tells Wolfram that he saw the Pope, who condemned him by saying that if he has enjoyed the delights of the Venusberg, he can no more be forgiven than the Pope's staff can sprout green leaves. Wolfram is horrified when Tannhäuser declares he will return to the Venusberg.
