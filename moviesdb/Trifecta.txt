Trifecta

 Born into a long line of powerful empaths Gideon has had to abide by only one solemn rule. He can only 'pull' other people's feelings into himself, never 'push' his own feelings out into the world. But when the love of his life is taken from at the hands of his fanatical father Gideon turns to darkness and is transformed into something that will shed light on the true nature of his unique abilities.
