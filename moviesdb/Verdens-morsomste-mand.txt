Verdens morsomste mand

 Made to coincide with the 100th anniversary of his birth, this one-hour television documentary examines comedian Victor Borge's life from his early life in Denmark under the name Børge Rosenbaum to his escape to America during World War II and his decades of success on Broadway and in television. The filmmakers had full access to Borge's personal archives, and the film features interviews with his children and grandchildren. Former ballet dancer Nini Theilade tells the story of how impressed she was when Borge first played the piano for her, and photographer Tine Harden talks about the time she spent with him in the final months of his life.
