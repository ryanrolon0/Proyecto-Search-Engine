Umbrella Dance

 By the beautiful Leigh sisters, who dance under an umbrella, with beautiful flowing locks, hiding at times behind the umbrella while the one is carried on the back of the other. The umbrella turned down serves as a concealment. Then as the umbrella is turned backward, they both come to full view again.
