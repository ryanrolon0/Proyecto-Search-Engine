The Love Project Journey

 Inspiring Friendships through Music with a goal to move people and to make music for musics sake Goal film with musicians from throughout the world. Not Genre-specific Music but Music that people can feel again. Dedicating Art to a Family that lost a very talented Artist utilizing His work. Combining Professional Collaborations World Cinematic Orchestrations Opera, using top studios from NY to LA and Lifers of Music - Some very well known and some that simply should be. We set out to make a Record and ended up on a Journey we never anticipated. Want to Share what we think should be passed on a worldwide level. Interested in submitting to film festivals end/2009 into 2010! All You have is Now. Make it Count!
