Villa

 Many of the Nazis still at liberty when in the 1950s nations closed books and turned over new leaves were hunted privately or publicly by Jewish vigilantes. Born in the shadow of murder and shame their various offspring, would eventually find each other. Maxim is a nice woman with a nice boyfriend, a nice home, a distant mother, a vague therapist and a foggy memory of her late father. With her bad dreams fast becoming her day to day reality she is pushed to edge of nervous endurance and will follow any path to end the nightmare. Villa. An atmospherically told and stylistically photographed psycho-drama frames the wilting mind of a woman, willfully hunted and victimized.
