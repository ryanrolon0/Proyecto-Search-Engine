The Usual

 The evening begins as so many do for Teddy, an alcoholic who spends night after night drinking himself into oblivion at his local watering hole. But Teddy is soon challenged to rethink his self-destructive ways by a mysterious patron whom Teddy has never seen before. Despite their seeming unfamiliarity with one another, it soon becomes evident that the 'Mystery Man' knows far more about Teddy than he should. Initially intrigued by the man's insights, Teddy soon discovers that his fellow bar mate does not merely wish to engage in a polite back and forth about issues of no relevance. Instead he challenges Teddy's opinions on his drinking and its effect on those around him. Suddenly faced with the harsh truths about his lifestyle, Teddy is forced to confront his issues head-on and reconsider the choices he has been making.
