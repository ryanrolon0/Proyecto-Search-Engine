Starving Artists

 Zach starves to produce an apocalyptic musical comedy. Doris and Jay starve to make a neo-noir thriller. Joy starves to write a comic book that the copy-shop won't copy because it's copyrighted to her. The street prophet starves because he has no food; but nobody listens to him because he's predicting the end of the world.
