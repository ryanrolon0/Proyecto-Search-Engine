Tears of Kali

 The eerie stories around the Taylor-Eriksson group and their members are told in three episodes, SHAKTI, KALI, DEVI, embedded in a frame plot. This group tried to re-define the limits of self-finding, sex and violence. Starting as a psychological cat-and-mouse-game, the story soon turns into pure horror.
