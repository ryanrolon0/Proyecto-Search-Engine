The Drummer

 The Drummer is the story of this inimitably talented but perennially disparaged man, the only true surfer of The Beach Boys and one of the truly original voices in Rock & Roll history. Intimate and personal, the story tracks the last six years of Beach Boys drummer's life, the younger brother to front man Brian, as he evolves into a creative force. Dennis Wilson digs his way out from under the shadow of his tyrannical father, corrals the demons and harnesses the will to tap his own artistry in order to create the critically applauded Pacific Ocean Blue. The film starts in the midst of The Beach Boys' fame and follows Dennis' journey, replete with decadence, drugs, love and tragedy. Despite Dennis' fall into drugs and alcohol, ultimately it is his music and his uniquely magnanimous spirit that endures.
