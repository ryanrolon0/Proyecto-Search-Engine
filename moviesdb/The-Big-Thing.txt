The Big Thing

 1851 Closure" (zipper) 1889 World Fair of the same year BUT, one detail that the history books never mention is that the World Ended that same year in 1889, in Paris. Just then, Lucifer & the Archangel Michael hatched a successful plan, followed it through, overcoming perilous obstacles, and got the job done. For the first time, our film documents and re-creates the End of the World as it really occurred.
