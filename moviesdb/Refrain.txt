Refrain

 'Refrain' is a dramatic narrative that follows the musical awakening of a young woman bound in an abusive relationship. Riya wrote songs in the middle of the night, in the bathroom, after her nose had stopped bleeding and the swelling in her cheeks had gone down... After her husband, Ash, had finally passed out. She wrote songs that will never be heard by anyone but herself. This had been the sad refrain in Riya's life for many years. But what follows is the bridge to a new verse; a chance for Riya to bring her songs out of isolation and into the light. With the help of friends who mentor and protect her, Riya aspires to shed the bonds of her abusive relationship and head toward her dream of one day playing her music for other people. The crescendo to Riya's story deals in love, violence, retribution and hope.
