Tabula Rasa

 Tabula Rasa is the story of a young girl who is being fed hate by her parents in the form of alphabet cereal in which words of prejudice appear. These hateful thoughts haunt her, and she throws up the breakfast. The next day, she prepares love cereal for her parents and cleans their metaphorical mind slates until they return to a blank tablet ("Tabula Rasa"). The family begins again, with love at the core.
