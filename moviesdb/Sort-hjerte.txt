 The tragic teenage love story of Stine and Tobias. Stine is a manic-depressive techno-fan with whom the soft-spoken Tobias falls head-over-heals in love. But Tobias is not ready for the swinging moods of Stine or the shocking story of her parents' death in a car crash. As Stine steers her life towards certain doom, all Tobias can do is try and keep pace.
