Purple Glow

 Astronomers across the world are watching the sky as a meteor is reported on a collision course with our planet. When the rock gets to crash on Earth, some campers in the neighborhood decide to venture in the woods to find that relic from outer space before the authorities. Problems arise when one of the ladies touches the alien rock and turn into a monster that feeds on human flesh.
