Sleep Away!

 SLEEP AWAY! is the story of a man, the deadlines he faces, and the perversions of nature he employs to win his race against time. When Cramer begins using mail-order stimulants to complete an assignment for work, he starts to notice bizarre changes in his friends. What he doesn't realize is when you toy with Mother Nature, sometimes you have to pay the price... with your brain!
