Vigilantes of Dodge City

 Red Ryder and Little Beaver arrive on the scene too late to prevent the hold-up of the freight coach and the theft of a big bank shipment. Red's Aunt, the Duchess, operates the freight line and is unaware that banker Luther Jennings wants to scare her into selling him the freight line at a low figure. Jennings has Red's herd of horses stampeded, and makes it appear that Red staged a fake stampede in order to defraud the government. Captain Glover arrests Red, who maintains his innocence and persuades General Wingate to allow him to go after the real crook. Little Beaver accidentally finds the gang's cave-hideout and Red and Captain Glover find evidence proving Red's innocence and incriminating Jennings.
