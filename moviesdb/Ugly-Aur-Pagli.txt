Ugly Aur Pagli

 We have all heard of soft romantic comic love stories. Now get set for a love story with a punch, a thud and some serious arm twisting thrown in with zero bedside manners. Ugly aur Pagli. It is the story of Kabir, a carefree guy who has been studying engineering for the last 10 years now, whose life goes for a sixer when he meets the quirky and kinky Kuhu. Kabir always wanted a girl to love and to make love but he never in his wildest dreams thought he would encounter a girl who could make him dance around circles, run semi naked, ride cycles without seats, wear high heeled ladies shoes... Oh trust us it gets worse. But the funny part is they actually fall in love with each other and what we get is one of the quirkiest love stories of the year. Dadar-based Kabir Achrekar lives with his parents and attempts to unsuccessfully obtain a degree in Engineering. Then one night while at Chhatrapati Shivaji Train Terminus he comes across an impaired woman and decides to assist her. He helps her board a Thane local, but she gets into fisticuffs with other passengers and they alight at Parel, where she passes out. He takes her to Hotel Godwin where he books a room for the night, and it is here that he gets arrested by the Police, held in a lock-up, as well in trouble with his mother, for not obeying her instructions to visit his Worli-based aunt, Sandhya. The next day is the beginning of one of many nightmares when he finds out that his cell-phone has been switched with the unknown woman, who contacts him, instructs him to meet her, and he agrees to do so. And it is this meeting that will change his life forever.
