Rhythms of Light

 We are the unique species that has independently acquired and exploited our ability to completely transform the natural environment. Our technological mastery has reached a point where it is fundamentally tied to the operation of the biosphere and a part of our human identity. Set in the framework of Vladimir Vernadsky's concept of the noosphere, Rhythms of Light explores the consequences of defying evolution through the use of artificial light. Have we set ourselves up in an environment where we are at an evolutionary disadvantage right out of the womb?
