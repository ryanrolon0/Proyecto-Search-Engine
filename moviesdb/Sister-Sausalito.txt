Sister Sausalito

 A rather Bohemian Nun from the Sausalito, California area, as much a contradiction in terms as that description implies, heads for city streets to attempt an unorthodox method of saving street kids. She's not prepared for the tragic and sometimes violent lives of these young people, but makes one connection that will change both of their lives forever.
