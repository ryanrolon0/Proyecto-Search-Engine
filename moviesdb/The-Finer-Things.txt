The Finer Things

 Broken under the strain of Wall Street, Saddler arrived in the West, bringing his butler and some few comforts to which he had been accustomed. He saw Jim Worthy and his child Helen and saw a miracle that he did not understand, for Worthy was happy and hard working. He looked first with contempt, then with envy at the happy farmer and then marveled at it all. His butler brought his mail and he angrily ordered it away. His wife and mother arrived by automobile, and he angrily and irritably ordered them from the premises. He wandered for miles over the countryside, nervous, quarrelsome, easily irritated, until one day, Little Helen, daughter of his happy neighbor, came to visit him. Her childish innocence, her sweet baby ways, brought about a revulsion of feeling in him. Why could he not be happy like her - like her father? A great resolve came to Saddler. He went to Jim Worthy and asked for work as a farm hand, and the delighted Jim was only too pleased to oblige him. One long year did this Wall Street man stick to his work, rising early and going to bed with the same promptness. After that lapse of time he surveyed himself in the mirror. The dark circles were gone, the step was elastic and hope and happiness swelled in his bosom. Then came his wife and daughter and he welcomed them with open arms, showing Helen, the child that had caused it all. And so he returned to his old life, a wiser, a healthier and a better man.
