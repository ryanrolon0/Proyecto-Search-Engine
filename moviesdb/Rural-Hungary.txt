Rural Hungary

 This entry in the narrated travelogue series visits the rural areas of Hungary, a country where three-fourths of the land is used for agriculture. The simple people live in small villages and raise geese and grow grains for bread. On Sundays, the people dress up in their colorful traditional attire, attend church, and gather later for folk dancing and singing. Out on the plains of the Puszta, Hungarian cowboys called Csikos herd sheep, horses and cattle. Back on the farms, a traditional harvest festival is observed.
