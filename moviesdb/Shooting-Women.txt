Shooting Women

 Our global documentary reveals the history of camerawomen around the world. For seven years, we followed the lives of camerawomen in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Senegal, the United States and other countries zones, and on major sets in Hollywood and Bollywood. "Shooting Women" celebrates not only the survival of pioneer camerawomen in a male-dominated field, but a new generation of camera women's visions.
