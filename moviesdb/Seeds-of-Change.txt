Seeds of Change

 Canadian Biologist Dr. Larry Wang, along with fellow scientist and childhood friend Dr.Sam Chao, decide to give back to the land of their birth by restoring the silt-ridden Yangtze River to health. The winding waterway serves as a metaphor for their circular life journey as they return home to help subsistence farmers along the water's edge convert to more environmentally friendly and sustainable forest-based agriculture.
