Sudden Birth

 Officer Bob North of the Berkeley (CA) Police Department is understandably nervous about assisting in an "emergency maternity", when a woman gives birth before she can reach a hospital. On patrol one night, Bob is dispatched to investigate a 'suspicious auto' stalled along a remote stretch of road. When he arrives, he finds a woman about to deliver her baby in the back seat! Bob remembers his first-aid training, which emphasized three points she gives birth, 2) keep calm and project an air of confidence, and 3) let nature take its course; don't interfere with the natural birth process--only a doctor is trained to do that. With Bob's help, the baby is delivered successfully just as the ambulance arrives. At the hospital, the doctor and the ambulance driver debrief Officer North and critique his performance. The doctor then discusses the types of equipment that patrol cars should carry for just such an emergency.
