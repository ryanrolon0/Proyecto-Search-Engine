The Borinqueneers

 This compelling film chronicles the untold story of the Puerto Rican 65th Infantry Regiment, the only all-Hispanic unit in U.S. Army history. Having performed with distinction early in the Korean War, the Borinqueneers of the 65th would face their greatest challenge in the fall of 1952, when more than 100 soldiers were arrested.
