Violeta de mil colores

 In NY city, surrounded by candles and rose petals, a tired-of-life woman carefully prepares her death place on a bathtub, turning her death into a ritual. While she floats, every single blood drop comes out from her veins and mixes with the warm water, and she starts to remind her nonsense life in little fragments. By the time the end of her life gets closer, she remembers the good and the bad times, her joys and shames, and the simple and complex facts that makes life be the life. These are the memories that make her choose between go on with her life or finish it.
