Stand by Love

 Two years after they broke up, two former lovers meet by chance on the plane of a transatlantic flight from New York to London. They chat, argue and pull each other's leg about the reasons for the end of their relationship. They inevitably involve the other travellers and crew members in their quarrels - before inexorably realise that they are still in love.
