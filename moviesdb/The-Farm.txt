The Farm

 A bounty hunter distraught over accidentally killing the woman he loves, travels to a remote area of South Dakota where he becomes the unwelcome defender of a small German religious group called the Mennonites. While building a tunnel to allow law enforcement to defend the town, he builds a relationship with his son who has come to avenge his mother's death.
