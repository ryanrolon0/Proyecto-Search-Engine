Vite in sospeso

 By all appearances, Dario leads a lush life in Paris stylish, his daughter is appealing, he's successful in business, and he has a circle of Italian friends in town. Beneath this veneer is a violent past and fear of discovery inadvertently is Dario's younger brother, Jacopo, who idolizes a brother he hardly knows, visits Paris, asks questions, and learns about his brother's terrorist past. What does Jacopo now make of his brother, and how do Dario and his circle respond to Jacopo's presence, especially when one of their number is arrested and when an ID card of Jacopo's indicates he may be a cop?
