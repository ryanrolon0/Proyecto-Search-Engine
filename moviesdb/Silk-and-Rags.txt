Silk and Rags

 SILK AND RAGS decade-long friendship between film maker Rachael Romero, (In the Shadow of Eden) and the Jamaican artist Monique Fagan Smith as she lives (by choice) on the NYC streets--much as a mountainman might live on a mountain. The intimate footage shows the complexity of a remarkable woman's life, belying the 'homeless' stereotype and raising the questions is home? What is family? What is accomplishment? What is wealth?
