The Story of Irena's Vow

 The film will capture and document the making of the play based on the true-life story of Irene Guy Opdyke, a polish nurse who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland while successfully hiding and saving twelve Jewish strangers. This will not only be one of the more unique documentaries of the Holocaust, but also one of the more unique stories about the heroism of women.
