Twisted Faith

 Father Reilly, a gay priest becomes entangled in counseling a young woman named Sandra, whose disturbing dreams open a window into his repressed past. This is a poignant film that studies extreme psychological effects on individuals who suffer systemic sexual prejudice and their subsequent social disenfranchisement.
