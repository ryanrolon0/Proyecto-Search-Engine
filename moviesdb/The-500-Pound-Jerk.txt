The 500 Pound Jerk

 A sports agent/promoter is looking for some new talent. When he has car trouble in the middle of nowhere, he discovers a country bumpkin who is REALLY strong. (This guy picked up his car!) Figuring this bumpkin is a natural for the weight lifting events in the Olympics, the agent brings him back to the city to compete. Only there finds out that his weight lifting techniques don't meet Olympics standards. This bumpkin is going to need intensive training while avoiding the distractions of the big city, and a cute little Russian ballerina.
