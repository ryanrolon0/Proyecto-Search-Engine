The 4th Beast

 Army Ranger Daniel Abrams has just come home from service in Iraq. His goals are simple; to live a peaceful life here in America and find love with Myra, a beautiful young private he met during his tour of duty. This dream comes to a screeching halt when Father Paul Anderson, a teacher he knew from high school, request him to deliver a disk containing information on the identity of the Antichrist to journalist Veronica Evans. But things become problematic when Delilah and Sebastian, two rogue Vatican agents, and their band of NOCs (agents with Non-Official Cover) come to steal the disk for their own purposes.
