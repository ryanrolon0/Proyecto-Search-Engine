Tartuffe ou L'imposteur

 When the religious charlatan Tartuffe insinuates himself into the household of the wealthy but credulous Orgon, it is not long before he takes over, acquiring the deed to the property, disinheriting Orgon's son, and becoming betrothed to Orgon's daughter. But when clever Elmire, Orgon's wife, trips up the imposter, Orgon throws him out only to finf himself arrested and his family evicted instead. A last-minute intervention by the King restores order and metes out justice.
