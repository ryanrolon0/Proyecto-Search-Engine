Polly's GlobalWalk

 Polly Letofsky walked 14,124 miles through 22 countries over 5 years and raised over $250,000 for breast cancer. From her September 11 walk through Muslim villages in SE Asia, a determined effort across India, and a lonely path through a rain soaked Europe, Polly tackled a rapidly changing world and educated thousands of women about breast cancer, one step at a time.
