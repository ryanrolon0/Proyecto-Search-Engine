The Day the Forest Opened Its Eyes

 Flood waters in a very remote Florida swamp have allowed computer programmer Alan Cummings, on a vacation fishing trip, to venture further into the swamp than any man has gone before. While Alan communicates via Satellite Video Monitor in his boat with coworkers hoping to join him camping, he slowly becomes aware that this patch of the Earth has seemingly taken on a life-form of its own. The night before friends from work are due to arrive; Alan is surrounded by an army of earthen monsters. The forest has taken on human shaped forms that lurch towards his tent with impossible broken movements, making garbled words and growling screams, they very angrily approach.
