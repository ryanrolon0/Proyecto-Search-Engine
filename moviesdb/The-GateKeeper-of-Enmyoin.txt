The GateKeeper of Enmyoin

 Teijun Ogawa, a female priest from the Shingon Buddhist Sect--a rarity in Japan--talks about her past, but refuses to speak about her experiences as a woman. She dies before the filming was complete. A homecoming visit (the husband of the filmmaker couple is from the area and had grown up listening to Teijun's chant) with the priest's mysterious successor, who is also a woman, a young woman, inspires the filmmakers to explore the older nun's unspoken feelings while they themselves struggle to find happiness and freedom in their immigrant family life in New York. Teijun told that she built Enmyoin temple. The area priests give different stories. As the filmmakers seek spiritual nourishment from the untold parts of Teijun's life, what began as a simple portrait turns into a genre-bending personal detective story, and the business of Japanese Buddhist world shows signs of its true face.
