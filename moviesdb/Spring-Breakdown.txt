Spring Breakdown

 The storyline revolves around three thirtysomething friends who break the monotony of their uninspired lives by vacationing on an island that's a popular spring break getaway for college co-eds. One of the women works for a powerful senator whose daughter is one of those co-eds, only she's as geeky as her chaperones.
