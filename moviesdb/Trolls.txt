Trolls

 There comes a time in every kid's life when they realize their parents are up to more than just "cleaning their room". For nine-year-old Billy, this discovery only comes with the help of his know it all younger cousin, Genevieve. When she explains the rules and point system of the "adults only" game, Billy and Genevieve start counting up their own points. Soon playground gossip turns anatomical, and Billy, with Genevieve close behind, tries to get to the bottom of what "doing it" actually means. Trolls is a hilarious reminder of those childhood moments which made growing up exciting, embarrassing and downright confusing.
