The Spider and the Fly

 Dianna Taylor and Michael Moore are two authors, who have a book and a film to publicize, try and out do each other by planning the perfect murder. Things start to go wrong when their publisher, who has them under an iron clad contract, is murdered using one of Michael's plot lines. Michael has an alibi, but one by one, the main characters are being killed off, and the police are still no closer to finding out the truth.
