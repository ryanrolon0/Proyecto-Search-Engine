Terror on Highway 91

 Deputy Clay Nelson is a young deputy who got the job he always wanted, a police officer for his town. However, soon after he begins, he learns of the ways of how his sherif operates. While he endeavors to be honest and dedicated in his job, the other cops engage in graft and torture of the accused among other things while the sherif acts like he is above the law. Eventually, his patience for this mockery of justice reaches the breaking point and Clay has to do something to stop it.
