Vogelfrei, Hors la loi, Outlaw

 A sequence shot is choreographed over the course of three performances in Vienna and thereby a film is created. The dramatic theme raises the question of the political dimension private actions can have. The sequences are located in central Europe and are staged as memories, dreams and phantasms in specially constructed installations and filmed simultaneously. Formally, the various locations will be ranked successively. Markings on the ground and a few set design elements identify the playing field. The camera focuses on the respective events and wanders through various locations like a dreamer.
