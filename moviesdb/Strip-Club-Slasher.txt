Strip Club Slasher

 A seedy, small town strip joint takes a down and dirty donkey punch to the back of the head when one of the girls is brutally murdered. Fearing that the killer may be targeting the local talent, the authorities shut the place down while they investigate the crime. Sad and scared, the other girls decide to spend the weekend together to reflect on the loss of their friend and to keep each other safe.
