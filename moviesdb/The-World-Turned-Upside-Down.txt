The World Turned Upside Down

 This film portrays the life of a typical Loyalist family, who were opposed to colonial independence in the American Revolution. Through the eyes and words of the young daughter, we see the unrelenting persecution of the family as a result of being on the losing side of a defacto civil war. Stripped of their rights and dignity, the family faces irresistable social pressures as emigration to the Northern colonies of what is now Canada becomes the only option.
