The 40th Annual Miss USA Pageant

 The theme of the 40th Annual Miss USA Pageant is The Spirit of America which is reflected in the opening song "Hooray for the USA". The patriotic theme was due (in part) to the USA's ongoing war in the middle east (Iraq) and the hope that there would soon be a peaceful resolution.
