RKO Pathe Reelism

 This short takes place in the ritzy Crystal Ballroon of New York City's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where Arthur Murray, of the dance-school franchise, has his Arthur Murray Dancers going through their steps with some modern terpsichorean that combine class and swing. Mr. Murray, in best frozen-face style, invites the movie audience to join in, but it is not recorded whether any of them actually did. Very few ever joined in on the follow-the-bouncing-ball sing-along shorts, and they could do that without leaving their seats.
