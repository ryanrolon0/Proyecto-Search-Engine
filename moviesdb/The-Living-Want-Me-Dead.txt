The Living Want Me Dead

 It's not uncommon for people to seem a little 'on-edge' come the holiday season, but for mild-mannered Howard Phillips, it just so happens that everyone else is suddenly running right over that edge with bloodshot eyes, foaming mouths, and unstoppable urges to kill...and they're running towards him. It could have something to do with the lack of shopping days left on the calendar, but Howard is betting that his recent visit to a medical testing facility is more likely to blame.
