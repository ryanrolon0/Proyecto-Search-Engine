Scraps

 Eva is a young woman who chooses to travel amidst a grim urban jungle doing what good she can. She's accepted by a few who see her as a shining light in the darkness and shunned by everyone else as a wandering vagrant. Eva must prove herself to a judgmental, image obsessed world by showing how one simple selfless act of love can effect the entire community in ways they may not even realize.
