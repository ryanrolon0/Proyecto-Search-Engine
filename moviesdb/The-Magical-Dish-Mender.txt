The Magical Dish Mender

 A magician steps upon the stage with a basketful of dishes, consisting of a complete dinner set. The basket falls from his arms with a crash, and the dishes are broken into hundreds of pieces of indescribable shapes. The magician hesitates a moment as if in great distress, but suddenly a happy smile appears on his face, and seizing his magic wand he waves it in the air, commanding the dishes to return to their original shape. One by one the various pieces, plates, cups, saucers, soup tureens, etc., begin flying through the air, at first apparently in great confusion, but ultimately drawing together and taking their places upon the table in perfect condition, thus in a few seconds transforming a mass of broken and apparently useless chinaware into a beautiful and perfect dinner set.
