The Shooting of Caribou Lou

 Inspector Clouseau goes to Canada to study Canadian prison systems. He is assigned to guard a dangerous criminal named Caribou Lou. Lou breaks out of prison and heads for a secluded cabin hideaway, taking Clouseau along as a hostage. Clouseau tries unsuccessfully to sedate Lou with sleeping powder mixed in with his porridge, then appeals to Lou's vanity by saying how Lou's chiseled profile would look good on film. Clouseau is permitted by Lou to take a photograph and secrets a rifle inside a fake camera with which to "shoot" Lou.
