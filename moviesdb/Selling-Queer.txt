Selling Queer

 Selling Queer examines what happens when a stereotype becomes a sales tool. Shot during Gay Days 2004 in Orlando, Florida, we follow several promoters and party-goers as they experience the event differently. Some cry for more charity and family, some are simply in love and others want to party. Find out who is really "Selling Queer".
