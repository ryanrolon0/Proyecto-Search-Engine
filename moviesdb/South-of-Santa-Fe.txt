South of Santa Fe

 This entry in Universal's "Musical Westerns" series of shorts is a semi-remake of 1937's "Courage of the West" that starred Bob Baker, and the cast here are costumed to match the characters from that film(with similar character names also)in order to use footage from the original film. Tex Williams is a Free Ranger who, with his pals Deuce Spriggins and Smokey Rogers, track down a band of outlaws.
