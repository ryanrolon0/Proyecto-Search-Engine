Sunday Funday

 A crew of friends are on their way to pick up Kenny from his suburban home. To their dismay they are shocked when Kenny tries to cancel on account of his wife telling him of her pregnancy. When DJ accidentally lets the big cat out of the bag that Kenny had his "tubes tied" also known as a vasectomy, Will, Kenny's brother loses his temper and turns around to head toward Kenny's home again. Questioning that there was no way that could be the father of his wife's child, Will persuades Kenny to make the playoff game and lie to his wife about going to the store. During the tailgate, Will establishes a game plan to catch Carolyn, Kenny's wife, in her cheating and manages to cheer his brother up with some Nitrous balloons he picked up the cartridges for earlier that weekend.
