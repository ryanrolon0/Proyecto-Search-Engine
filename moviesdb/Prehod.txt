 A painter named Vlado paints a portrait of an unknown woman. When the portrait "becomes alive" and the woman in the painting shows up at the artist's exhibition opening, Vlado's life is turned upside down. As Vlado becomes involved in a passionate affair with the mysterious woman, he does not even notice that he has fallen into the trap of Zom, a para-psychological organization which controls the actions of individuals by entering their thoughts, which is the meaning of "passing". A whirlwind of curious events and unexplained suicides takes him into a world where reality and fantasy are intertwined, a world created by a manipulative international corporation. In the world where relationships are just a means to an end and death is only an illusion, control and power are of ultimate value. Vlado realizes that he cannot trust anyone and even doubts his own sanity. However, it turns out that the naive artist is not such an easy target
