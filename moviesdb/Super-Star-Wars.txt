Super Star Wars

 The fifth episode of the Star Wars trilogy is now on your Super Nintendo! It opens on the ice world of Hoth, where Luke Skywalker and his band of rebels have established a base. They chose this particular planet because they figured the Imperial forces wouldn't sink to freezing their hinies off looking for them. One afternoon as Luke is traveling on his TaunTaun in the snow, he notices a meteorite that strikes the ground. It's an Imperial Probot! So he must battle Wampas, probe droids, and other dangerous Hoth creatures but beware! The Wampas can breathe on you and turn you to ice! Dodge the snow covered valleys and dangerous caves, then climb aboard the snow speeder and take out AT-AT Imperial Walkers and AT-ST two legged ones. And then, while Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO fly off in the Millennium Falcon, Luke and R2-D2 head for the swamp planet of Dagobah to learn from Yoda, a wise old Jedi Master. Meanwhile the Falcon runs into Imperial problems, so they decide to travel to Cloud City on the remote planet of Bespin. But the Empire beats them to it, C-3PO winds up in the Ugnaught junk room, and what is more, Han Solo has been encased in carbonite! Sensing his friends' troubles, Luke races to Cloud City in his X-Wing, but watch out for Cloud Cars because they don't cotton to visitors! Luke arrives in Cloud City, only to wind up in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader! Remember, Do or Do not. There is no try!
