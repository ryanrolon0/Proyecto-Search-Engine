Twin

 Holly Davis is struggling in therapy after the death of her twin sister, Haley. Her therapist, Jennifer Campbell, Ph.D., suggests Holly try a new form of bereavement therapy. Jonathan Knightley, a representative of Restore Industries, promises that Holly will be able to speak with Haley. Has the company found a way to contact the dead? Or, is it all a mind game, achieved through a high-tech version of a magician's sleight of hand? Will Holly learn what she needs to accept her sister's death?
