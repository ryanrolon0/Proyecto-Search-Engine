Una aventura llamada Menudo

 Xavier, Miguel, Johnny, Ricky, and Charlie (the Members of Menudo) decide to take a hot air ballon to a concert and end up crashing in the woods. The boys have their own adventures (jumping in the mud, skateboarding, stealing motorbikes, playing practical jokes on each other, throwing sea sponges, and meeting beautiful girls) while the record company tries to get them back so that they can perform in concert.
