The Demand

 Set against the backdrop of the world's most viewed sporting event, The Demand explores the anticipated increase in human trafficking in South Africa leading up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. With the opening ceremony of the games only weeks away and media reports of 40,000 women and children being trafficking into host cities, this intimate look at the human trafficking industry follows a group of public officials, activists, street ministries, and police as they race to ready themselves and the citizens of South Africa before the first match.
