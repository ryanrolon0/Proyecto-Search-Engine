Store Front

 The rumors are rife that a Venture capitalist will visit soon, but will not identify himself or herself. It could be any customer that enters that day, which places the store owner on edge. The staff includes the stock boy who is secretly in love with the pregnant receptionist; the delivery man is his rival for her affection. No one knows who or where the father of the receptionist's unborn child is. It's the night before Halloween and all is more weird then usual at Store Front. The store owner Mr Hondo is obsessed with sending out Halloween holiday emails he thinks would bring in more customers. The computers are attached by a mysterious video spam. The mobile geek network is called for help only the geek drinks the coffee and is changed forever. A scary Halloween mannequin arrives and a little after people start disappearing.
