Rum and Coke

 Linda is a bright, confident and independent daughter of Cuban immigrants who has vowed to stay away from all Latino men. She has a safe, comfortable relationship with her average, self-absorbed boyfriend, Steve. Her passionless life is all planned until she meets Jose, a handsome, aggressive and charming firefighter, who woos her back to her roots and proves love is a risk... and so is learning to dance Salsa!
