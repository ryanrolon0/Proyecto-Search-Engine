The Body Shop

 Emminent plastic surgeon and mad scientist Don Brandon loses his wife Anitra - pinup model and social butterfly - in a tragic accident. He and his faithful humpbacked and drooling assistant Igor - oops, I mean Greg - busy themselves experimenting with re-animation experiments. Once ready, the good Doctor begins luring young women back to the lab with hypnosis in order to gather select parts to create a New and Improved Anitra.
