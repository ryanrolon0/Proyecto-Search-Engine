The Coldest Winter

 The Coldest Winter is a WWII Battle of the Bulge story that tells the tale of an American Soldier, and a German soldier, both left for dead, who awaken on the battlefield only to find themselves fighting for survival against their wounds, the weather and each other. A second storyline follows a naïve, frightened, Captain, sent out to track down missing intelligence with a newly demoted Sergeant turned Private from the Black Army, and a battle-hardened and battle-hungry Sergeant. Constant in-fighting, racism, and power struggles ensue when the troops get lost in the Ardennes forest.
