The Other Shoe

 We are in Brooklyn. The most diverse ethnic groups live here without sharing a folklore or tradition, each one on its own, but united by two common elements defend. One street, Broadway, serves as boundary and as common ground for three communities ultra-Orthodox Jews, all together underneath the tracks of the elevated subway that goes to Manhattan. In this multicultural space, the stories of three characters are intertwined Spain who demands too much from himself and the people around him; Richie, a young Hispanic drug dealer who dreams of escaping the basketball court where he carries out his business; and Abraham, a Jewish landlord who withdraws into his work in order to avoid a reality he can't bear to face.
