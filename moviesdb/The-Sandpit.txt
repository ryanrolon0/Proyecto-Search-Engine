The Sandpit

 A day in the life of New York City, in miniature. Shot as over 35,000 stills in Manhattan and Brooklyn using a 'tilt-shift' style, this film watches the pulses and rhythms of the city and its inhabitants from a different perspective. Serendipitous moments of people's collective everyday experience form a rich visual mosaic of urban life.
