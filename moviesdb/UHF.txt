UHF

 The wortless daydreaming slob George Newman can't keep a job for more than a few days at a time before he gets fired. Fortunately, his uncle wins a UHF television station in a poker-game (it was almost bankrupt), which George Newman is put in charge of. Will the new job be any different from the last few jobs he's had? George Newman (Yankovic) is a normal man. Problem is, he's also a daydreamer, who can't keep hold of a steady job. His uncle decides George will be the perfect man to manage Channel 62, a station which is losing money and viewers fast. George's imagination is put to good use and he starts thinking up bizarre shows such as "Wheels of Fish" and "Raul's Wild Kingdom". The ratings start to soar again, but not everyone is happy. An unemployed visionary finds a job as the manager of a television station his uncle owns. Unfortunately, due to gambling debts, the uncle is forced to consider selling the station to a rival station's owner. With popular less-then network standards of programming, George and his friends try to save the town's new favorite station.
