The Prince, the Showgirl and Me

 'Colin Clark' (qv), younger brother of 'Alan Clark (IV)' (qv) and son of Lord 'Kenneth Clark (V)' (qv) wanted to work in the movies. When 'Laurence Olivier' (qv) and 'Vivien Leigh' (qv) came to dine with his parents, he mentioned his ambition to them and they arranged for him to work as 3rd assistant director on the forthcoming _Prince and the Showgirl, The (1957)_ (qv). Colin kept a diary throughout the production and this documentary is a dramatisation of that diary with lots of behind the scenes footage of Marilyn (and 'Arthur Miller (I)' (qv)) in England and of the production of the film with all of its associated problems.
