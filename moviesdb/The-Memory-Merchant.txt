The Memory Merchant

 A young girl returns to her childhood home to reunite with her estranged father, Bick. Upon finding him she sees that he is not the man she has cherished in her memories since she was a child, but a ghost-like shell of a man with little to no memory of who she is. Determined to solve the mystery of her father's physical and mental decaying, Newt stumbles upon a old hermit living in the woods who just might have the answers she is looking for. But what price is she willing to pay for her father's salvation?
