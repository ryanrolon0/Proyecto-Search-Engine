Rosafuria

 Vita and Rosa are teenagers. The first lived in Genoa, in the Northern of Italy, then all her family moved in Naples, in the Southern of Italy. The two girls are very different in temper and disposition, but, after a first moment of almost hate, they became great friends. And Vita, younger and apparently weaker, will show herself the stronger of the two.
