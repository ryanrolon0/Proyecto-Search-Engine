The Real McCoy

 A city slicker from Elmira, NY, speeding through the back woods, gets a look at a lovely woman, a local school teacher, and decides to pose as a mountain man, the last of the McCoys, to get her attention. A skunk and a split in his trousers may derail him before he gets properly started. Then, local whiskey runners think he's an undercover cop. To prove his bona fides, the gang wants him to sing an Appalachian song. Can he deliver a convincing performance and win the mountain gal's heart? Or has he made a serious miscalculation?
