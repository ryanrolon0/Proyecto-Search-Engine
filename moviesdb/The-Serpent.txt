The Serpent

 Peasant girl Vania is assaulted by a duke who murders her lover and sends her away to London. There she becomes a famous actress. The Duke, seeing her perform but not recognizing her, hears that his son is wounded. "If anything should happen to my boy, I think it would kill me." That's all the motivation Vania needs to go to the front, find the one-armed paralyzed boy and marry him. Next she arranges to make love to his father just as the boy enters the room, causing the young man to blow out his brains. Vania, a beautiful young peasant, falls asleep while worrying about getting her father's consent to marry her sweetheart Andrey. In her dreams, she lives a completely different life, as a vampirish vixen wreaking havoc in the lives of those she believes have done her wrong. The dream Vania determines to have revenge on the Grand Duke who has ruined her life, and no wickedness will prevent that revenge.
