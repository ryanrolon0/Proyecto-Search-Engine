The Dummy

 A newlywed couple visits a fortune teller just for laughs. The fun soon turns to terror after they insult the woman and leave without paying. The fortune teller then unleashes an evil spirit inside a creepy-looking ventriloquist doll that she commands to kill anybody who speaks to the couple on their first anniversary. The silent, murderous dummy kills without words, unlike the Chucky movies. A creepy, Italian-style independent horror movie that's fun and wicked with an unexpected ending.
