The Adventures of Daniel

 Nineteen-year-old Daniel,a stand-up comedian,is dating the sweet Emma, but her father disapproves of his career,preferring the smarmy go-getter Matt Spencer,who is going out with Suzie,his other daughter. Daniel sees an opportunity for revenge when he invites Matt to do an open mike spot at his stand-up club, anticipating that he will bomb. In fact he is a huge success. At least Emma's parents appreciate that Daniel has a career and show him some respect. However this is instantly withdrawn when Daniel gets his arm stuck in a condom dispensing machine,in anticipation of a night with Emma whilst the parents are away.
