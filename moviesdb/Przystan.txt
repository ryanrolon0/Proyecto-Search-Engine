Przystan

 Karolina is a teacher in a small town whose life seems somewhat bleak and empty until she meets Jan, in town to take part in a seminar for young businessmen. They fall in love, but when Karolina goes to visit Jan in his hometown of Warsaw, she is followed by a twelve year old boy who is 'in love' with the teacher. When she discovers the boy has no money or return ticket, she tells him to wait for her while she visits Jan. The date, however, turns out to be nothing like she had expected.
