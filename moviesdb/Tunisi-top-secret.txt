Tunisi top secret

 An Italian orphan countess, Katy, wants to be a journalist, but is dismissed from her work because she does not bring in hot news; she hears that young Prince Scedid is about to inherit the throne of his father, and that he lives an irreproachable life - actually so secluded that almost no one knows him. With her friends Simona and Barbara, she goes to Monastir in Tunisia, to set-up the Prince of Scedad and to take photos of him in some compromising situation that will give Barbara headlines in the scandal press. The English government is aware of a death menace against the future ruler of Scedad and sends three secret agents to protect him Knicherbocker, Mr. George and Baron Philippe. The political enemies of Prince Scedid have paid two thugs, Pedro and Paulo, and a belly dancer, Sherazad, to approach the Prince and kill him. Neither of these nine persons possess a photo of the Prince, as he lives such a secluded life, and their conflicting enterprises and various disguises will lead to plenty of confusion, and daring situations. In the end, the three freelance reporters will not achieve their end, but they will find love in the arms of a Tunisian doctor and two English agents.
