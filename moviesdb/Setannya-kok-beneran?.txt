Setannya kok beneran?

 With their career acting as ghost-busting paranormals in a fake reality show is about to end, the three phony losers accepted an invitation for a friendly meet and greet in a village out of town. At least a taste of being a celebrity before their television career is over. They did not realize that the villagers didn't invite them for a fan meet, instead to get rid of an angry ghost that's terrorizing the village. Trapped with nowhere else to go, our scared fake heroes are forced to deal with a real ghost, or everyone will know that they are nothing but impostors.
