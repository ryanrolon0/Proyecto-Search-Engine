The Garden

 After the death of his mother, the vegetable garden becomes 11 year old Liam's lifeline to the world. For James, surviving the death of his wife has meant a total disconnection from the world, keeping pain at arm's length. It is only when Liam's beloved garden comes under attack by the family goats that James reconnects with his responsibilities as a father and Liam can once again become the child he really is.
