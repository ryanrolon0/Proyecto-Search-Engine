Some Called Them Baby Killers... We Call Them Heroes

 Contrary to the hero's welcome received by other veterans, the majority of men returning from Vietnam were barely given a handshake of appreciation...much less parades and accolades. Their training did not prepare them to gracefully blend back into civilian life afterward, especially if some cruelly perceive you to be a 'baby killer.' This documentary takes a closer look at their service and family life. As each man recounts his story and contemplates the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, we get a glimpse into the lives of these unheralded heroes.
