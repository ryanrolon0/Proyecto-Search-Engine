The Mannequin

 After an accident months earlier, Patrick remains a recluse in his apartment with only mannequins as his friends and his brother to stop by every once in a while, who tries to convince him to go outside again. As the night progresses, he left only to be pushed by his fake friends to leave the apartment and deal with his situation, before it is too late.
