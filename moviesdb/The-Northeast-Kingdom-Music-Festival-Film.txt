The Northeast Kingdom Music Festival Film

 This vibrant concert film/documentary includes three years of highlights from the intimate Vermont music and arts festival (2004-2006). Performers include Toubab Krewe, The Spam Allstars, The Devil Makes Three, Oteil Burbridge and the Peacemakers and many others. The film carries you on a colorful journey through a seamless weekend at the locally celebrated festival and features fan interviews, coverage of festival activities and events, behind the scenes footage, and 21 eclectic performances that took N.E.K.M.F audiences by storm year after year. Set against a backdrop of Northern Vermont's rolling green mountains on the 90-acre Chilly Ranch that is home to the festival site, the film is framed by breathtaking scenery. Giant dancing puppets tower over concert audiences and fire-twirlers light up the brisk night sky as one great band performs after another, each concert poles apart from the next. From hip-hop to folk, bluegrass to rock and funk, a score of genres are represented by the acts that took to the N.E.K.M.F stage and shined. Many of the fans in attendance at the Vermont event have attested to an experience unlike any other concert festival. As said by festival site owner Bill Pearce at the close of the film, This is one of the places that the revolution starts.
