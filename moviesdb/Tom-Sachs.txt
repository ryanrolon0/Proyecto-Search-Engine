Tom Sachs

 An intimate portrayal of world renowned artist Tom Sachs at work in his New York studio. While Tom and his team, drill, draw, and hammer, Tom speaks about his worldly views, his work, his inspirations, and his beginnings. The audience gets a true sense into who Tom Sachs is --- an opportunity to see and understand the man behind the creations. Preparations are underway for a major exhibition next spring, and Tom walks us through his working process as we tour his studio and discover the artist as an individual. For the first time on camera, Tom's art is secondary. The personality we unveil becomes a statement of art in and of itself.
