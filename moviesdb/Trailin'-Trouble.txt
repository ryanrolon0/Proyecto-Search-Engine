Trailin' Trouble

 Ed King travels east to sell Pop Blake's cattle. While there Buck, another of Blake's hands, plans to rob Ed by using a local girl Ming Toy as a decoy. Ming Toy gets the money and returning empty handed, and before the other hands arrive, Ed is surprised to find Ming Toy return with the men. Cowhand Ed King (Hoot Gibson) is in love with Molly Blake (Margaret Quimby), daughter of the rancher (William McCall) he works for. When Ed takes a shipment of horses to Kansas City, Buck Saunders (Pete Morrison), his no-good rival, plots to have Ed robbed of the payment money for the horses and discredit him in the eyes of Molly and her father. Ed sees some ruffians roughing up a Chinese girl, Mig Toy (Olive Young) and saves her... he thinks. While she is bidding him thanks and an affectionate farewell, she lifts the money from him. Ed misses his train and steals a ride in an airplane. (Gibson's real-life passion was owning and flying airplanes in meets across the country, until he was nearly killed a few years later. ) Blake accuses Ed of theft and things look bleak until Ming Toy shows up, returns the money and denounces Buck as the conspirator.
