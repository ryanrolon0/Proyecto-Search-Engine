 Ladislas Starewitch (1882 - 1965), European Disney, a pioneer of puppet animation is one of the most forgotten film geniuses. He was named as a true Wizard and an Alchemist of animation, whose wizardry was born in Lithuania; he got his fame in Russia and flourished in his full power in France. Unique methods of animation, never disclosed to others, - who was he? This film will be an effort to "decode" Starewitch by using the means of his own artistic thinking, and tiding together the biographical facts, memoirs, factual information, films made by Starewitch himself driven by the love story of puppets.
