Stolen Souls

 Toby Ferguson, a famous photographer, has just bought a one-of-a-kind antique camera. Now all his models are turning up dead. Stephanie, his assistant, is caught between her admiration for Toby, and her fear for her friends. It is a mystery that baffles Detective Carl Hall, assigned to investigate the murders. The case will lead him back through the history of the camera, through ghost towns and ancient Indian beliefs that it is the camera which is turning everyone it photographs to dust.
