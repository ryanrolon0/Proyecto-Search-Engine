The Comedian and the Flypaper

 This is another funny one. The absent minded clerk is about to leave the office on an errand. He reaches for his silk hat, which he had thoughtlessly placed on a piece of fly-paper lying on the table. As he is about to place the hat on his head, he finds it sticks to his hand. He then places the paper on the floor and tries to free himself from it by stepping upon it, but it sticks fast to his shoes. He then pulls it from his shoe, and it sticks fast to the other hand. An idea then seizes him and he places it upon the table and sits on it. Pulling it from his hand, he leaves the room in apparent satisfaction, but to the great laughter of the audience, the fly-paper is hanging to his coat tails.
