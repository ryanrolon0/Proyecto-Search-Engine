The Knight Waltz

 For years, Batman and Catwoman have had a very non-conventional, love/hate relationship. Neither willing to completely submit to the other's ways. What was once an endless fight, has now become a sensually painful dance of seduction and courtship. It is their unending struggle. It is their Knight Waltz.
