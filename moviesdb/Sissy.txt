Sissy

 Sissy is a fourteen year old girl living on the streets to escape her dysfunctional home. Her mother, addicted to good-for-nothing men but carrying some guilt about her daughter's situation, has a plan. She arranges for Sissy to go on the road with "Uncle Charlie," a struggling, unstable magician headed out on a two-bit tour through Nevada. When the trip begins to deteriorate, so does Charlie. This leaves Sissy even more isolated than she was when she was all alone, and forces her to find the strength she never knew she had.
