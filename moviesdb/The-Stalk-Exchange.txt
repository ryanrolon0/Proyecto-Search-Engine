The Stalk Exchange

 The deal was worth $264 million...and it was going to be the easiest money any body ever made. Smooth talking Jakinde Lawanson has a sure -fire way of selling this bogus deal to a bunch of greedy and unsuspecting foreigners. All they have to do was come to Nigeria and meet the man behind the deal, Dr. Egoma Onwuelingo. And thereafter send a worthless shipment of car and airplane parts to Lagos..."
