Under uret

 In this television documentary from Copenhagen's central railway station, we meet its travellers, its staff and its inhabitants of homeless people. We hear their stories of waiting for the family member who may or may not be on the next train, of worrying about the addicts who do drugs in the water closets, of not getting what you wished for in life and coming to the station to find someone to talk to or a young couple to watch from afar. The film becomes a close portrait of a place and its people, emphasized by interesting detail photography and jazzy score music.
