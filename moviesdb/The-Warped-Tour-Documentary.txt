The Warped Tour Documentary

 The Warped Tour documentary captures the heart and soul of The Van's Warped Tour. It sheds light on how the Warped Tour has become the longest running and most successful traveling music festival in American history against all odds. It speaks to a generation and reflects their views on life, music and politics. The film reveals how a million patrons a year pass through its gates to find the central meeting place for a generation. It also illustrates the underdog story of Kevin Lyman, and how his good nature and natural generosity are at the core of the scene's success. This is the first documentary to tell the complete story of the tour's rocky start in 1995, to its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and its importance in music culture today.
