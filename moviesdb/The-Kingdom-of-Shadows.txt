The Kingdom of Shadows

 A lonely 8-year-old boy, Alex, discovers a doorway to the magical kingdom of shadows. This is a world, which exists purely of scenes from the Lumiere filmstrips. It is a silent world, one without sound. After finding his way back home, Alex tries to convince his parents of his discovery. Later, Alex's father visits the kingdom and encounters some of the eerie ghost-like figures who live there.
