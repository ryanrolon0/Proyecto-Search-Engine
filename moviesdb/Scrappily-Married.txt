Scrappily Married

 Henry the rooster attempts to sneak out but his wife, Chickenpie, catches him and orders him to sit on the eggs, a job he hates. Along comes Herman the mouse who frightens away Chickenpie after taking one look at him. Henry sees the advantage to this and enlists Herman as his friend to keep Chickenpie away. Chickenpie tries to scare Herman away disguised as a cat, then sends a real cat after Herman when the costume fails, leaving Henry at Chickenpie's mercy. Just when all looks hopeless for Herman and Henry, Herman traps the cat in a cage and returns to frighten the wife away.
