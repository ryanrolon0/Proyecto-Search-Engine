Rubbish

 London. A capital city filled with culture and opportunities that truly represent the modern voice. Yet some things never change. No matter how many times you pass it or see it right in front of you, rubbish is simply left forgotten. Litter in general is one of London's greatest, yet most overlooked, problems, an issue that indirectly changes the face of the cityscape. But what is rubbish? What is the difference between the product and the packaging? Should we think of it as anything of less value? Perhaps there are different solutions to just blissful ignorance... Compelled to accept the challenge and approach litter with a different perspective, the drama follows one habitant who has found his own unique take on the idea of recycling. Showing a new way of thinking about the problem with litter, the film looks to raise questions about the current situation and in turn challenge the audience to think about the things we throw away in a new light. Take a journey through London as never seen before.
