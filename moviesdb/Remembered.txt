Remembered

 In the untamed West of post-Civil War America, the outlaw Dead Eye Porter is lost in the Nevada desert, having been mysteriously shot in the side. On his way for an appointment in San Francisco to begin publication on a book detailing his exploits, he is rescued by a young black man with seemingly good intentions. It quickly becomes apparent that the man is not all he seems and the two unlikely traveling partners must keep a close eye on each other as well as the dangers that surround them if they hope to make it out alive.
