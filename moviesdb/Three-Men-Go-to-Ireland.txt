Three Men Go to Ireland

 'Griff Rhys Jones' (qv), 'Rory McGrath' (qv) and 'Dara O'Briain' (qv) return for a journey through Ireland, beginning on an 80-year-old original Guinness barge with a temperamental engine. Making their way from Dublin to the Aran Islands, the trio get involved in more boat races, unexpectedly find themselves the subject of a parade, and create the first Limerick limerick competition.
