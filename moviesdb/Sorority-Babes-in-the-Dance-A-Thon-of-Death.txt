Sorority Babes in the Dance-A-Thon of Death

 Four sorority sisters conjure up a demon from hell from within an ancient crystal ball. However, one of the sisters is changed into a rampaging ghoul bent on raising hell through partying! Only two elderly antique dealers can rescue the gals (and sex-wanting frat boys) from certain doom, but not until they've taken their ghoulfest to the discotheque and turned it into the dance-a-thon of death!
