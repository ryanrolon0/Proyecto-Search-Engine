The Ballad of Robert & Harvey

 The homeless are different from you and me. They have no homes. But they share with us the ability to love, the need of friendship and hope, and the capacity to surprise. Indian American filmmaker Parthiban Shanmugam explores the complex society of Atlanta's homeless in this haunting documentary. Centered on the troubled friendship between Robert and Harvey, the film exposes the unique hardships and common humanity of people who live among us but are virtually unknown. Part love story, part social commentary, the story intensifies when affection and hope encounter the darker sides of personality, including a suspicion of murder. Further complexity is added through a compassionate examination of social rituals within this surprisingly organized community. Even in this alien world, tragedy has a familiar face.
