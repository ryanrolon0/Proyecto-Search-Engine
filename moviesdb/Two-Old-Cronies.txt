Two Old Cronies

 The interest manifested by these two gentlemen (who are evidently of similar taste, and the best of friends) in the illustrations they are examining, is made so very apparent by their facial expressions and gestures, that it requires no words to convey its meaning to the audience. The hearty laughter resulting from their evident buoyant remarks and illusions are alike indulged in by actors and audience.
