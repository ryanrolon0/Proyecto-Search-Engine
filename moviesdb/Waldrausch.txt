Waldrausch

 After years of absence, engineer Lutz Ambross returns to his home village Maria Schnee with the job to build a dam. He can persuade most of the residents to accept the offered compensation for their land and houses - only the greedy Crispin sets them up against Lutz to raise the price. Both do also compete for the love of Beda.
