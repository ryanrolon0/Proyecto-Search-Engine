The Next Movie

 Maxine lives in a world where friends have become her cast, the river near home is an exterior location for scattering of her father's ashes, and the music on her Mp3 player scores the routine events of her daily life. This invented reality allows her to cope with the sudden, tragic death of her father, a man whose passion for cinema now lives within the heart and soul of his youngest daughter. With her shot list and storyboards flickering through her mind, she directs the final scene in which the father's ashes are scattered. Maxine, however, had never planned on becoming a character in her own film.
