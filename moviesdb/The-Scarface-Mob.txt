The Scarface Mob

 Special Agent Eliot Ness (Robert Stack) forms The Untouchables, an elite squad of incorruptible lawmen, in order to bring down underworld kingpin Al Capone. First televised as a two-part episode of the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse in April 1959, The Untouchables was later combined into one seamless version for movie theaters titled "The Scarface Mob." Here, accompanying this movie version are the Desi Arnaz and Walter Winchell introductions that preceded parts one and two of the original Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse broadcast.
