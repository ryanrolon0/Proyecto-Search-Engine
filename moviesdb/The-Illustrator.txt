The Illustrator

 The Illustrator is the story of an American artist living a life of solitude. Losing his loved ones from a young age, Jack Ridley moves from his home in Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia. He is a loner, an outcast, distanced from society, and relying on his unique illustrations and memories of his past to survive in a foreign city he struggles to fit into. A chance encounter with a young Australian boy in need of help suddenly forces Jack to decide whether he will continue living in isolation, or reveal his one secret to the world.
