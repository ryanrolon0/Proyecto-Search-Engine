Sheepshit

 Three guys walk into a bar to put in place the makings of one of the best April Fool's gags ever. The heroes here - a world class dart champion, Lewis Newsome, known around dart competitions as "The News"; a Spanglish-speaking ladies' man, Roe "Rude Boy" Ramirez; and the bar tending man with the plan, Rylan "Gin" Thomas - are looking to pull the wool over the eye of their friend Ali "Lee" Ray... but as even the best of plans go awry, ingenuity remains spry. Since Lee's birthday just happens to fall on April Fool's day, he's not one quick to fall for gags, and with this in mind, the heroes intend for the gag to work as both prank and present.
