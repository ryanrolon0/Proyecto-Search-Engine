The Unruly Hare

 Elmer Fudd is a dim-witted surveyor trying to lay out a new railroad track. When his work disturbs Bugs Bunny, he finds himself overwhelmed by the wascally wabbit's antics. Bugs' attempts to befuddle Fudd result in an explosive finish, as well as a patriotic warning to reduce unneccesary travel!
