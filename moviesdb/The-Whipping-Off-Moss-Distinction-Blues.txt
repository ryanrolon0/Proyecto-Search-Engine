The Whipping Off Moss Distinction Blues

 An animation that has been inspired by recent world political events, but is really a general commentary on politics, power and death. It consists of altered video, 3D models and animation, effects, music, and generated sound composited together. Some of these elements include old blues songs, archetypal film and TV fragments that have been modified and recombined.
