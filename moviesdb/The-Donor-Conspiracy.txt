The Donor Conspiracy

 A couple of goofball medical students haphazardly stumble upon a kidney harvesting operation in their apartment complex. Who knew that becoming anti-heroes, extracting organs and crossing the Mafia could turn their lives into a slapstick comedy? Gavin and Curt are two talented but behaviorally challenged medical students who are almost finished with medical school. In an effort to pull one last prank, they outfit a cadaver with a remote-control penis, but it gets them expelled. Without any future, they stumble upon a kidney-harvesting ring in their apartment complex, and despite every effort to stay away, soon find themselves thrust into the middle of the operation. All they need to do is find a kidney for Gavin's girlfriend, a heart for the head of the local mafia, and get back into medical school. It's not as easy as it sounds.
