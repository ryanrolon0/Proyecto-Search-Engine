Symphoria

 In his late 20's, Shawn Wittig is the epitome of the spoiled rich kid living on the largesse of an indulgent single playboy father. Having just returned from a 10-year stay in Europe where he fled to escape a possible manslaughter charge, Shawn is struggling with addictions to drugs and alcohol. Within months of his return to America, Shawn is involved in a DUI accident. Instead of prosecution, Shawn is released into a teaching/rehabilitation program at the local university run by JT Dalton, a brilliant but mysterious chemist. At first JT's and Shawn's relationship is antagonistic but, after a late night in the chemistry lab, it becomes something deeper. Soon JT and Shawn are involved in an illicit and highly sexualized affair that begins to consume both their lives. When the University catches wind of the affair, JT is promptly suspended and Shawn's father forces the young man to give up his romance with his older professor. Unable to keep apart, however, the two lovers soon reunite and their relationship turns deadly.
