Trespass

 Five friends who break down on their way to their camping trip get lost looking for help. Unknowingly they Trespass on private property. This special piece of private property and the family living there has it's own set of rules for who will live and who will die. Will our lost friends make it or will their 'Trespass' be their last one!?!?
