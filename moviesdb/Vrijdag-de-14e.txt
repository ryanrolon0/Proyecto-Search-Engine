Vrijdag de 14e

 Stef is 16 years old and very clever. She has a passion for drawing and painting art, but keeps it a secret from her parents, who are anxious awaiting her test results for Harvard University. Stef secretly visits the Art Academy and there the "punky" Nick introduces her to art and life itself. She gets a positive letter from the University, but won't she rather follow her own dreams?
