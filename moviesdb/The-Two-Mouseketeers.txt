The Two Mouseketeers

 This Tom and Jerry cartoon is set in 18th century France. Tom, who is a soldier in a castle, is assigned to guard the food laid out on a banquet table. Jerry and a smaller mouse companion, two wandering "mouseketeers," make the situation miserable for Tom as they abscond with (and occasionally eat) all the food they can.
