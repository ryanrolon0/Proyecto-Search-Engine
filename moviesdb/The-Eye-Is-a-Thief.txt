The Eye Is a Thief

 "The Eye Is a Thief" is a brief study of two complementary modes of eroticism girl confesses her most satisfying sexual encounter to conservative dinner party guests, revealing a hidden desire to be watched. Part 2 ("To See") opens on a reflection of man on a window pane spying on another man. Meanwhile, a young socialite finds a key under a neighbor's doormat and, giving in to curiosity, enters the apartment, which, unbeknownst to him, belongs to the onlooker from the opening scene. Thus the onlooker, immersed in his own voyeuristic acts, unknowingly becomes the object of another voyeur.
