Season of Kin

 Tired and dejected, Peter struggles with his overbearing responsibilities. By night, he guards an old industrial estate while his days are spent at home, caring for his sick grandmother. When his friendly boss, Errol, invites him over for a meal with his family, Peter reluctantly agrees. But, as Peter is about to discover, all is not well in Errol's house either.
