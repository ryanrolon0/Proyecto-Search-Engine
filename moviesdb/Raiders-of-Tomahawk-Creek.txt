Raiders of Tomahawk Creek

 When a rancher, part of whose property is in Indian territory, is murdered and robbed of a silver ring of Indian origin, the new Indian Agent, Steve Blake (Charles Starrett) investigates. He finds that similar murders and robberies have taken place, one victim being the rancher father of Janet Clayton (Kay Buckley). Ex-Indian Agent Randolph (Edgar Dearing), responsible for the killings, frames Steve for one of the killings and he is jailed. His pal, Smiley (Smiley Burnette), a correspondence school detective, trails Dike but is captured. Steve breaks jail and, in his guise as the Durango Kid, begins to bring the villains to justice.
