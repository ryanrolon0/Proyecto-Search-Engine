The Lone Rider Rides On

 Tom Cameron is after the man that killed his parents when he was a boy. Obtaining a deed from a family killed just like his, he runs into trouble with Mitchell whose men committed the murder. Accused of the murder by Mitchell, he is quickly tried and convicted and the Judge he recognizes as the man he is looking for. While Bob Cameron ('Al Bridge' (qv)) and Ma Cameron ('Isabel La Mal' (qv)) and their young sons, Jim ('Harry Harvey Jr.' (qv)) and Tom ('Robert Winkler (I)' (qv)), are traveling to land they purchased in Miracle Valley, they are attacked by Graham ('Karl Hackett' (qv)) and his henchmen, and Tom alone, apparently, escapes. Years later, when Richard Brown is en route to take possession of land bought from Frank Mitchell('Frank Hagney' (qv)) in Flat Rock, he is murdered by Mitchell's gang. Tom Cameron ('George Houston' (qv)), now grown and famous throughout the West as "The Lone Rider,", a solitary avenger, discovers Brown's body, finding a bill-of-sale to the Wagon Wheel ranch, signed by Frank Mitchell, on Brown's corpse. Recognizing the similarity in Brown's murder to that of his own family, Tom rides to Flat Rock. There, he learns from "Fuzzy" Jones ('Al St. John' (qv)), a storekeeper, that Mitchell, "Curly" Robbins ('Lee Powell (I)' (qv)) and the other gang members have been selling the same land to people for years and no one has ever come to claim it. He also learns that this territory was once called Miracle Valley. Tom, posing as Richard Brown, rides to the ranch where Sue Brown ('Hillary Brooke' (qv)), Richard's sister, believes Tom is really her brother as she has not seen him for over ten years. Ere long, Tom also discovers that his own brother, whom he thought dead, is one of the current gang members. Despite the "original" credited to Joe O'Donnell, this plot had been made at least five times earlier, credited to other writers.
