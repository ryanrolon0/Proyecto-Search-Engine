The Bag Witch Project

 In this gamer-centered parody of "The Blair Witch Project," three roleplayers wander into Milwaukee's Convention Center to participate in a legendary roleplaying event, "The Bag Witch Tournament." The three hapless dorks quickly get lost. Without food, water or a clue, they wander past telephones, exit signs and elevators in a fruitless search for a cool game. Eventually one of their number vanishes without a trace. The remaining two gamers spend the night in the men's room.
