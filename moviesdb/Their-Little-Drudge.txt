Their Little Drudge

 The village Cinderella leads a humdrum life until a chance remark and an accidental meeting bring her into two of the most wonderful adventures. Thereafter she ceases to be Cinderella and takes her place in the world as a beautiful woman, to whom homage is due. A theme which touches a deep truth in a way to make this artistic picture linger in the memory.
