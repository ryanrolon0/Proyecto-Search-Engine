 Four friends decide to spend yet another night cruising around town. As the car goes deeper into the night, the four friends discover they live in a neurotic society most likely on the edge of a collapse. They try to explicate their views on the crumbling remains of a pseudo-democratic society going rotten by the minute. This only brings them to an even more uncomfortable conclusion deteriorating as the environment they criticize.
