Till We Eat Again

 Bobby and his sweetheart are hungry - and broke. At their boarding house, Bobby figures out a way to steal some food but the landlady quickly puts the kibosh on that and chases them out of the house. Walking down the street, Bobby is caught by a hook and hoisted ten stories above the street before he falls on a pile of mattresses a salesman is demonstrating. He give Bobby $50 for helping make the sale, and Bobby and his honey go to a diner and order $50 worth of wheat cakes.
