Salaam Memsaab

 Radha (Zarina Wahab) and Sunder (Asrani) and a child (Master Jeetu), are street singers, who earn their living singing and dancing on streets, especially in the posh area near the Taj Mahal Intercontinental Hotel opposite Gateway of India in Bombay, India. Radha is pretty much down to earth and is content with living this life, working hard. But Sunder has big dreams of becoming rich, wealthy, and famous - quickly. Sunder's dreams do come true, albeit temporarily, when he wins a all-paid week's stay at a five star hotel, and comes in contact with the rich, the wealthy, and the famous. Lyrics penned by Majrooh Sultanpuri. Two songs stand out even now "Hum bhi rahon me khadey hai yaar idhar dek lo janeman pyar se ik nazar dek lo..."; and "Na sharab hamey kaam hai, ye teri nazar ka kamaal hai jo laga diya hamey kaam pe....".
