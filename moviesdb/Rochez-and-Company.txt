Rochez and Company

 The Sisterhood of Charity inducts a new member, Ms. Shirley Jackson, into their circle. Through a series of misunderstandings, Gavin is locked in the freezer as he tries to prepare for the ladies luncheon. Victor rescues Gavin from the freezer and Gavin goes on a tirade against the kitchen and wait staff. After Gavin serves the salads at the luncheon for the ladies, he offers the ladies fresh ground pepper. Suddenly, the Sisterhood of Charity's luncheon is ruined by Margaret Devine's sneeze, which has epic repercussions. Florida and her crew plot to destroy Rochez and Company while Victor and his crew try to save it.
