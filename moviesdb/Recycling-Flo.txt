Recycling Flo

 When Jake meets an intriguing young woman, Fran, at a party, sparks fly. This heat leads to a torrid affair featuring breathless sexual gymnastics in imaginative places (the top of the washing machine during the spin cycle, for example). This mad bliss grinds to a halt with the arrival of Fran's dog Flo, who moves in with her own ideas about bedroom activities, as well as poor table manners and a very exotic skin condition. The sex becomes less and less gymnastic. Trapped in what has become a very untenable menage a trois, Jake finds an imaginative, not to mention ecological, solution to his problem.
