Un soir de joie

 Based on a true story from November 1943 publish a fake edition of the pro-German newspaper 'Le Soir', put on sale by surprise in the newsstands and stuffed full of parodic articles pouring ridicule upon occupying forces. The film faithfully traced the course of this humorous and enterprising attempt to wake up the populace, filling out the basic plot with irreverent patriotic gags.
