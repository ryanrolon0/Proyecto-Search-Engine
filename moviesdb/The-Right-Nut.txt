The Right Nut

 A lost Pug and his million dollar diamond-studded dog collar lead a luckless slacker on a ridiculous and disastrous cross-Alabama road trip. Locked out in his undies and mistaken for a peeping Tom in his own backyard, Stanley Tyson is slapped, run over, burned, and cursed at by dozens of ill-tempered rednecks. Dog crap flies in the face of good taste and intelligence in an adventure celebrating failure and ineptitude.
