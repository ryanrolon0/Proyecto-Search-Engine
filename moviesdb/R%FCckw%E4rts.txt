Rückwärts

 The whole film was shot with a camera running backwards. The plot deals with the inversion of the dimension of time, with a world in which time suddenly moves backwards. Only one slightly secluded bachelor - Otto Trebert - has not yet caught on to this strange development. He alone continues to move forward and because of this abnormality he gets involved into terrible difficulties. One day he decides to do something against it.
