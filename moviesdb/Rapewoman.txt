But the telephone calls don't stop, and the mysterious pervert caller is bothering her there too. Naoko reluctantly agrees to meet meet him at a local restaurant, hoping the man will stop. When she arrives, Naoko is surprised to find the cafE is operated by Harada, a man whom she and Mari had liked so much in the past that, in fact, they had cat fights over him at their working places.
