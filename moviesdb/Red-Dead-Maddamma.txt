Red Dead Maddamma

 A plot in a Custer/Soltis movie? Ridiculous you say? We think not! Kirk Johnson (Steve Maddamma) has two weeks to fix the errors of his life or else he will spend eternity in hell. Joining Kirk on this quest for redemption is Virgil (Ben Haubrich), his spiritual guide. Join Kirk and Virgil on this sprawling journey that has them crossing paths with an angry bum, drug dealers, a deranged killer, a local white knight, homosexuals, religious figures, the Grim Reaper and Kirk's vicious mother, Rita Johnson (Sarah Cawford).
