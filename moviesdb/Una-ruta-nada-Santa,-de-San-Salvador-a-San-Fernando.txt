Una ruta nada Santa, de San Salvador a San Fernando

 A group of undocumented immigrants crossed Mexico hoping to make it to the United States, to the American Dream. Nonetheless, a few kilometers from their destination, 72 of them were massacred. This crime is one of many committed on the so-called Route of Death. This is the story of Victoria Castro, a young 15-year-old girl, and Francisco Antonio, a 30-year-old father of four children, two of the souls lost in the massacre of San Fernando.
