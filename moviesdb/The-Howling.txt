The Howling

 Eye-popping special effects highlight an updated werewolf story. TV newswoman, Karen White, goes on a retreat after a traumatic incident with a serial killer. But is she really safe? And what should she fear more regaining her memory or the creepy residents of "The Colony"? Followed by many unsatisfying and unconnected sequels. Helped launch shortlived werewolf craze in early eighties. There is a serial killer on the loose, Karen White is the only reporter he communicates with. After a near fatal encounter with him at an adult video store, she is ordered to take a vacation. Eddie was killed by Police, but Karen doesn't want to let it go and discovers that he came from a tiny community in the woods and that's where she decides to vacation with husband Bill. Big mistake, because Eddie was an outcast of a pack of Werewolves who is trying to keep a low profile and doesn't want any interviews. Can Karen and Bill escape the village of the wolf? After assisting the police in capturing "Eddie", a serial killer who had been preying on the homeless, news anchor Karen White needs a rest and at her psychiatrist's suggestion heads to The Colony, his own clinic. Her role in capturing Eddie had been quite traumatic and Karen can't picture his face. Once at the clinic however, strange events lead her to believe that her life is in danger. What she does not realize is that the clinic is located near a den of werewolves.
