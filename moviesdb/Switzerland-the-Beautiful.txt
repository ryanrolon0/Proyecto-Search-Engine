Switzerland the Beautiful

 Four million ethnic French, German and Italian people live in the European country of Switzerland - the oldest existing republic in the world - which is known for its friendly nature, neutrality and spectacular scenery. The Alps form a large part of that scenery, but the Alps also played an important part in the country's history by stopping invading Roman armies. An abundance of vividly colored alpine wildflowers cover the mountain meadows in the spring. The mountain pastures are seen as community property, available for all farmers to use for animal grazing. In size contrast to the tiny wildflowers, the rushing mountain streams are fed by melting snows. Alpine chalets are colorfully and intricately painted, especially around the windows. Switzerland is also known for the manufacture of fine watches and clocks, but they are also known for the manufacture of more traditional items cities are Lucerne, a tourist mecca renowned for its covered wooden bridges and lion monument; Interlaken, a resort town; and Geneva, a center of international finance, the headquarters of the League of Nations and the city where the Red Cross was founded, its name and logo taken from the Swiss national flag.
