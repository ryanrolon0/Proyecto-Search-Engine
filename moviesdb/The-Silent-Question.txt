The Silent Question

 Set in the distant past The Silent Question considers issues of femininity and hysteria. The story explores the repressed creative desires of the female protagonist (Alex McTavish), a young middle class woman suffering with post natal depression. In a bid for recovery she endures the 'rest cure,' a Nineteenth Century treatment for female hysterics whereby the woman is forbidden to engage in any intellectual and/or creative endeavours. In compliance with the wishes of her physician husband she spends much time 'resting' at their isolated summer home.
