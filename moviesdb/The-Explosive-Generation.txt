The Explosive Generation

 Peter Gifford is a likable, dedicated schoolteacher that teaches a senior life skills class. When student Janet Sommers brings up the topic of sex and dating, he asks students to write questions on the topic, and will cover them in the next class. The parents get wind of what Gifford is about to do, notify the principal, and he warns Peter not to read the questions in class. Gifford decides to go against this and is suspended. The whole student body protests, and the administration gets worried on what to do. At Mason High School, one of idealistic teacher Peter Gifford's classes for the senior students is on college preparedness. Instead of sticking to the prepared curriculum, he feels they would be better served on a discussion about what are the important issues of life post-Mason to them. After some hesitation, what the students place on the top of their wish list is a frank discussion about sex - not the technical aspects of it, but the human emotions behind it. Mr. Gifford agrees, asking the students to write down questions and concerns anonymously to which they will discuss during the next class. Two issues from this exercise arise. First, student Janet Sommers is most concerned about an incident between her and her steady boyfriend, Dan Carlyle, and between fellow students Bobby Herman and naive Marge Ryker at a party the previous night, after which the foursome spent together for the entire night. Dan, Bobby and Marge are all concerned about discussing what they see as solely their private matter. And second, the parents learn about the planned discussion on sex and mistakenly Mr. Gifford's "sex survey", but also the all night party. The parents without exception are shocked by both. What ensues is a battle of wills between the students, the parents, Mr. Gifford and Principal Morton. The students, feeling like they are being ignored in what is happening directly to them, decide to take radical action to be heard.
