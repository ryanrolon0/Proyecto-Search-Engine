The Dreadnaughts

 The Dreadnaughts are an ancient race of gargoyles living in modern day Los Angeles. Their leader Dresden has accumulated an army of bloodthirsty creatures that when released would bring a darkness upon the earth never seen before. An internal power struggle takes place between the Dreadnaughts when Dresden's successor is mysteriously killed.
