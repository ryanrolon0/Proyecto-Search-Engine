Vacaciones de terror

 An evil witch gets burned at the stake, but not before vowing to return and get her revenge. A hundred years later a family arrive to spend their vacation at a summer home located in the same immediate countryside area where the witch was killed. Trouble ensues when little girl daughter Gaby finds an ugly doll that's possessed by the lethal spirit of the malevolent witch.
