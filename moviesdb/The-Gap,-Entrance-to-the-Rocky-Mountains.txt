The Gap, Entrance to the Rocky Mountains

 "This, and the subjects immediately following, form a series of magnificent panoramic views taken in the Canadian Rockies over the line of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. The entire series has a stereo-scopic quality which has occasioned the most enthusiastic praise wherever the pictures have been shown. The scenery is the most magnificent on the North American Continent, and the view, as if one were riding on the cow-catcher of a locomotive running at high speed, is one that even tourists riding over the line are not privileged to enjoy."
