Severed Lives

 A small group of college students decides to film a documentary on the twenty-year old murders of two sorority girls for their senior thesis project. Each student carries a secret that threatens to sever the seams of the film's production and, even worse, their friendships. But one student's secret verges on deadly, and soon the group finds themselves running for their lives from a maniacal killer intent on hiding the past.
