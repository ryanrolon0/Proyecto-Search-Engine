The Absence of Light

 When a scientist discovers the possibility of the meaning of life, two shadowy organizations learn of this and will stop at nothing to steal the scientist's work for themselves. As a result, two burned-out assassins named Puritan and Sultan are assigned to protect the scientist and keep his project from falling into the wrong hands. In a bleak near-future, two sinister corporations are at an internal war with each other for control of North American politics. The first corporation, titled 'Plague' which is run by the sinister ex-government operative known only as Whiplash is for creating chaos and discord in the world to consolidate their power in world affairs. The other corporation, and the "lesser" of the two evils, is 'Section 8' run by an operative known only as the Higher Power whose job is blackmail, assassination and infiltration for its high-paying clients. Focusing on two grizzled agents of Section 8, the professional Puritan and the newcomer Sultan are sent by Higher Power to protect a corrupt U.S. Senator named Criswell whom is seeking re-election and wants his sordid past protected at all costs, leading Puritan and Sultan on various and episodic cloak-and-dagger missions which take them across the USA, while other employees of both Plague and Section 8 take on their own adventures while trying to get ahead of one another in this dark, episodic story of murder, greed, corruption, assassination, fantasy, and every thing thrown in for good affect.
