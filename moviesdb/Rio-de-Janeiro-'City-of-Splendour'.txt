Rio de Janeiro 'City of Splendour'

 James FitzPatrick narrates this visit to a city on an inlet discovered by European explorers 400 years ago. We see Sugarloaf mountain from various views and travel through this city of more than 1 million people. We see its mosaic sidewalks, its many parks, and its royal palms (planted originally by Portugal's king while in exile in 1808). We visit swimming clubs and the avenida along the waterfront. The city is a haven for racial tolerance tiny shops where young women make butterfly art and the wings of Brazil's 700+ species of butterflies. Many finished pieces are images of Sugarloaf.
