Ver e Amar!

 The love story between a young pair, and their adventures and misadventures with the vaudeville theatre as background, and the temptations chorus-girls represent for the young man. The film depended extensively on musical numbers and fado songs registered in discs, played in the theatre house from a gramophone.
