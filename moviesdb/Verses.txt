Verses

 A chain-smoking trouble-maker enters a poetry contest at a local cafE, where he faces off against some heavy hitters including a handsome easy-going favorite. In the cafE, he makes friends with a blonde, who has relationship commitment problems and a political activist, who has another more personal secret. The film stays at the cafE and relies on its wordsmithing to keep the audience involved.
