The Lost House

 What began as a film experiment with shadow and light evolved into an abstract horror movie shot almost entirely in miniature using cardboard, paper and clay. Focusing on suspense, mood and tone, as opposed to violence and gore, patients veer away from the graphic detail of the modern horror genre and center on the anticipation of the event and what our imagination supplies. Utilizing techniques such as lighting, green screen, stop-motion animation and sound, the patients create a world that exists somewhere between the Mr. Bill comedy shorts of the late 1970s/ early 1980s and David Lynch's abstract conceptual film, Eraser head.
