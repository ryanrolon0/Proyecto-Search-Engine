She Loves Me

 Maraczek's Parfumerie is the setting for this romantic musical about the many entanglements of love. Georg Nowack and his co-workers lead quietly dreary lives as sales assistants in a little boutique in Budapest. That is until Amalia Balash shows up, asking for a job. As soon as she is hired, through no fault of her own, tensions begin to mount inside the store. Just as Georg and Amalia come to hate each other passionately, Georg discovers that Amalia is his secret pen-pal with whom he exchanges "Dear Friend" letters. How can they reconcile their simultaneous love and hate for each other?
