Soldiers in the Shadows

 For some New Yorkers, life changed dramatically after 9/11. Tyler is a charismatic young man who has started running a coffee shop in downtown Manhattan with his friends, Larry and Manson. Routine life for Tyler on MacDougal Street is broken by the arrival of a Saudi Arabian student named Fausi. He is a shy and well-educated young man who becomes Tyler's neighbor. The two of them agree to respect each other's culture, but everything changes when a secret agent named Romulus 12 begins operations in Manhattan.
