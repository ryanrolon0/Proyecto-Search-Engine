Seduction of Innocence

 Small-town girl journeys with friend to Dallas to visit older sister, only to find that Sis is a) working as a stripper, b) tied up with some kind of drug syndicate, and c) living with a lesbian. Our heroine gets interested in "dancing" herself while her friend gets interested in the older sister. Lots of nudity on stage and a fair amount of lesbian friendliness. Standard exploitation fare, interesting mainly for the mostly-positive light in which female homosexuality is portrayed.
