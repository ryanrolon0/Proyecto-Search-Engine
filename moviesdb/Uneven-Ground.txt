Uneven Ground

 Myron Oliver, a television journalist for a tabloid-style current affairs show is handed another story to investigate. On paper, it looks like any ordinary dispute between troubled neighbors fighting over noise and fence lines, but what Myron unearths throws his world into disarray and makes him question everything he thought he knew about reconciliation, racism and being Aboriginal in a twenty-first century White Australia. Uneven Ground is the compelling account of Myron's personal journey into an unacknowledged reality of discrimination and injustice towards Indigenous Australians. A genre-bending mix of fictional characters and real people in both fictional and non-fictional situations, Uneven Ground offers a unique and valuable insight into issues surrounding race relations in contemporary urban Australia.
