The Bombay Project

 From director David Kahn comes a thought-provoking and innovative film set at the crossroads of two cultures. Mike, an American film student, reluctantly travels to Bombay, India to assist a graduate student, Rahul, in the making of a Bollywood movie. Mike initially finds it challenging to adapt, but as the magic of Bollywood begins to win him over, he finds himself falling in love with the lead actress Preeti. When Rahul's parents announce an arranged marriage between Rahul and Preeti, this news threatens Mike's enchanting new life. Will he be able to follow his heart and fulfill his romantic Bollywood dream, or will the cultural traditions of India deny Mike the very visions he conjured from its popular culture?
