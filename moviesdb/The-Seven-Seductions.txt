The Seven Seductions

 Christopher Hamilton is a wealthy and arrogant British playboy seeking the ultimate sexual experience. His quest eventually leads him to the mysterious sanctuary of Madame Lau, an exotic oriental temptress endowed with mystical powers. She promises Christopher that he will find the gratification he seeks - but that the key to this treasured reward lies only within himself. Transforming herself into a host of beautiful women, Madame Lau caters to Christopher's every whim, and soon he is ushered into an erotic world where his fantasies come to life in graphic detail.
