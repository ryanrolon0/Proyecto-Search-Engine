The Devil's Tramping Ground

 Cassady languishes in the dull reality of the workaday world, holding a state job but longing for the bright lights of the big time. As a founding member of the hardest working band in town, The Pre-Madonnas, Cassady believes that he and his friends Izzy, Mick, and Lily are on the verge of something great. But while their songs and performances have gained life as of late, the audience at their shows has been lackluster and the pay, non-existent. The Pre-Madonnas trudge on, pursuing one last rock and roll dream in a town that doesn't notice or seem to care. But all that changes one night on an old haunted patch of ground in the pine barrens of North Carolina. The Pre-Madonnas pursue their destiny with a fateful choice one night, and the events spiral towards their conclusion. The Pre-Madonnas' luck has changed. Cassady's phone won't stop ringing, and the gigs keep pouring in. Izzy receives a large payoff, and Lily has finally found someone she can relate to. Things are going well for the Pre-Madonnas. But who was that hooded figure from the party? And why does Cassady keep seeing him around town? When a band would give anything to become instantly famous, just how far would they go to get it, and what would be the consequences? The Pre-Madonnas tangle with these questions and find their place in the annals of rock and roll history to be altogether different than what they bargained for.
