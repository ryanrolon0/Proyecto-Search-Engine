The Adventures of the Wildlife Refuge Rangers

 All the animals at the Lackafauna Wildlife Refuge are in danger from the Apathy Monster! An alert goes out to the only one who can stop it. From deep in the heart of Mt. Rushmore, President Theodore Roosevelt, along with his faithful sidekick Puddles the Blue Goose, set out in their balloon. Nate, a young video game addict, joins them. If Teddy and Puddles can convince Nate that the country's Wildlife Refuges are worth saving, the Apathy Monster might be stopped. Can they make it in time?
