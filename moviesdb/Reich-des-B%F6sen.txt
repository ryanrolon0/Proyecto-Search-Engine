 Our knowledge of Iran is limited by what we see and read in the media. The director of EMPIRE OF EVIL Mohammad Farokhmanesh lives in Germany by choice and is Iranian by birth. He visits its capital Tehran and encounters the reality of modern Muslim society, torn between prejudice and the quest for personal identity. The protagonists speak openly and discerningly of their problems and hopes and about how they envisage their future.
