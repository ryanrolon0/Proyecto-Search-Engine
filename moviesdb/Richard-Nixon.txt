Richard Nixon

 Senator Richard Nixon, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, gives a speech as part of the 1952 presidential campaign. He discusses a fund that had been created for him to pay for his political activities and enumerates his own personal finances. Nixon comments that he did receive one gift from a political supporter -- a cocker spaniel dog which his daughter Tricia named "Checkers." Nixon calls upon the Democratic nominees to make full financial disclosures as well. In response to questions as to whether he will resign as the vice-presidential nominee, Nixon says that he is not a quitter, but he will leave it up to the Republican National Committee to decide whether he should stay or go. He calls upon viewers to contact the Republican National Committee to give their opinion on the subject. Nixon concludes his speech saying that whether he stays on the ticket or not, he will continue to fight against crooks, Communists, and their defenders, and that a vote for his running mate Dwight Eisenhower is a vote for what's good for America.
