Stand Up Funeral

 An aspiring comedian misinterprets a request from his now deceased friend to have a happy funeral and does his routine instead of a eulogy. He appalls the crowd, then tries to go the opposite way and sing his dead friend's praises as much as possible. The crowd is confused and upset, he is not describing the real person they knew. Finally the comic finds a middle ground, making jokes about the endearing habits of his dead friend. But just when the crowd is warming up he throws in one off-color joke and they beat and chase him out of the church.
