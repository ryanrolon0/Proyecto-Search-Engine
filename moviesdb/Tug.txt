Tug

 England, 1890. Boyd, the black sheep of a small fishing community, is found with blood on his hands after a fight with his now missing brother. Jumping to conclusions, the villagers spring a macabre plan to enact their own twisted version of justice and revenge on Boyd and send him out to sea with his father.
