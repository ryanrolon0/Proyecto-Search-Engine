Sea of Demons

 Two years ago, while diving in the Pacific Ocean, Scott Cassell was viciously attacked by a giant, 200+ pound Humboldt squid. His flesh was torn by 30,000 razor sharp teeth. His arm pulled from its socket with bone-crushing strength. His body dragged down into black ocean depths. Miraculously he escaped with his life. Now, fully recovered, the former Special Forces diver is ready to face off against this very real Sea Monster once again. Protected by his specially-designed "squid-fighting" armor, Cassell will risk his life to film this deadly predator up close and personal.
