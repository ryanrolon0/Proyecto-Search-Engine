Un monde meilleur

 A man stands alone in a lovely pastoral landscape of grass, sea, and sky. He is a soldier imagining this peaceful place while his reality is a fierce firefight at a weapons depot. The soldier is skilled. He kills using various weapons; the corpses of his mates gives him pause. We move back and forth between the battle and the scape. What's in store for the soldier?
