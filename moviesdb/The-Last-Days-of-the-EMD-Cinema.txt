The Last Days of the EMD Cinema

 The historic EMD Cinema in Waltham Forest is widely regarded as one of London's finest cinema buildings. Created by architect Cecil Massey and the world famous Russian stage designer Theodore Komisarjevsky, the venue was originally opened as the Granada Cinema by legendary showbiz mogul Sidney Bernstein in 1930. 'The Last Days of the EMD Cinema' traces the history of the venue from its early days as a 'cine-variety' theatre up to the highly controversial closure in 2003 and the lengthy public campaign to preserve it as a place of entertainment. Drawing extensively on footage shot during the closing night Gala Show and previously unseen archive film, the documentary provides a rare insight into the complex story of a unique cultural and architectural gem.
