The Chicken in the Case

 A young man's aunt refuses to give him his inheritance until he marries, so he passes off the wife of his friend as his new bride. His ruse is threatened when his aunt takes a liking to his new "bride" and whisks her off on a retreat when she thinks that she (the bride) is becoming too attentive to her "husband"'s friend (her real husband.) Now it's up to the young man to tell the truth and straighten up all the misunderstandings.
