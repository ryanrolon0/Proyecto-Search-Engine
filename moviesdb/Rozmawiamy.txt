 The city at night is a place where people wander, some because of sorrow, others because they seek love and adventure. The city by night is shown from the point of view of two taxi drivers, a man and a woman, both of whom have landed in this job because of life problems. The taxi drivers have an additional job for which no one pays problems, while they keep their own to themselves. They drive around city all night, meeting people who are a reflection of the place and time in which they live.
