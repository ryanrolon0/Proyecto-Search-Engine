Shiny Thing

 Shiny Thing is comedy/drama about a seventeen-year-old boy, Lochlan, who feels under appreciated by his mother, the dazzling Harriet Kitchener, or Kitch, as her fans have dubbed her. Harriet is a warm, charismatic and flamboyant woman who has made a life for herself down at the town's one and only cabaret club. Born for the limelight and having been a standout performer since the club's opening in 1986, Harriet has attracted a considerable amount of admirers over the years. She loves their attention and Lochlan has quite frankly had enough of being left on the outside. So he goes in search of a new mother, having to look no further than his own classroom. He sees great potential in Carolyn Kibre, his delectably stiff, bland-as-cardboard schoolteacher and takes great pleasure in busting his way into her personal bubble to find her maternal side. But the pleasure of Mrs Kibre's attention is soon stolen away when Mrs Kibre meets Harriet and is captivated by her glittery world. Lochlan is cast into the shadows yet again, so fed up and bitter, he gives his mother an ultimatum; the club, or your son? To avoid losing her son forever, Harriet is forced to come face to face with the difficult decision that she has been avoiding for years. What is truly more important? Is there any way they can both find happiness?
