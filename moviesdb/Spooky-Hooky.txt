Spooky Hooky

 The gang puts a phony absent note on their teacher's desk so they can go to the circus, then have to get it back when they find out that the class was going on a field trip to the circus anyway. A circus is coming to town, and the gang is dejected because they have to be in school. But not to worry. One of them draws up a fake absence note to get them all out of school and goes to put it on Miss Jones's desk. However, while he's doing that, Miss Jones tells the rest of the gang of her plans to take the whole class to the circus. Before they could recover both from surprise and the note, the door to the school is closed and locked, and the live-in custodian will not let them back in. With no choice but to get the note back, the gang breaks into the school in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, despite recovering the note, it storms that night and they all get sick from it, and are not allowed to attend school the next day anyways.
