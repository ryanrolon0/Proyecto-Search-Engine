Refren pir Kosovin

 Fatmira is a drama about a 7 year old girl, who after the death of her mother, wants to meet her again by traveling to a mountain where she believes that people continue to live as Zanas (an Albanian mountain fairy) after their death. This becomes increasingly difficult when she meets Mrs UN, a UN Judge.
