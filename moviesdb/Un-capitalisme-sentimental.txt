Un capitalisme sentimental

 A Sentimental Capitalism is a tragicomic tale on the extension of economic logic to art and love. The film chronicles the apprenticeship of Fernande Bouvier, a naive country girl, who, traveling from Paris to New York in 1929, from avant-garde Bohemia to the narrow circles of high finance, will loose a few illusions.
