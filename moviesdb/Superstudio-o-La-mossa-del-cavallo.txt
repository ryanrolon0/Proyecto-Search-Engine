Superstudio o La mossa del cavallo

 SUPERSTUDIO comes up again and Piero Frassinelli tell about themselves. SUPERSTUDIO the Florentine group of Radical Architecture, between clear visions and insight, between life and art, between past and future, proposes his story from the Continuous Monument to Globalization, from Supersurface to the Net, in the midst of prophecy and demonstration, utopia and reality. Uninterrupted thoughts, words, dreams and works of SUPERSTUDIO, down through to the roots of human kind and of architecture... and back.
