Sawa Lakh Se Ek Ladaun

 Sathpura-based Kartar, changes his religion from Hindu to Sikh, enrolls as a rebel to fight the oppressive Mughal rule, goes missing even on his wedding day, and ends up getting married in absentia to Shanno. The rebels liberate Khairabad from the lusty Chaudhry Qutb Din, and form a Panchayat led by Ghafoor Khan and Jamal Din only to face the wrath of Subedar Ali Shah who instructs the Mughal hordes to do away with the Sikh rebels, as well as reinstate Qutb Din.
