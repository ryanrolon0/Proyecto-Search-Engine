Time of the Other

 A memory of a love in a room becomes the site of a mystical journey into the idea of Memory and Time. The film is the story of a woman who comes back again and again to that room to locate what is no longer there. The love story becomes the journey of cinema in its own gaze , to tell a story that is metamorphosed into the idea of the world memory. The story of a woman trying to locate her own time, like the ones of Bresson's Mouchette , Godard's In Praise of Love, and Tarkovsky's Mirror, to find out what is looking for is on the other side, on the side of 'Time of the other'.
