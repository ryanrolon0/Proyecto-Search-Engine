The Vanquisher

 Sector 70 is a noir-ish dystopian future where prosperity belongs to the few - and those determined to take it. Jarron Brenner did well by the system until his body was invaded by the technology he helped to sell. After a series of traumatic events, a mysterious agent Miranda May takes it upon herself to help save Jarron's life. Soon, however, they find themselves hunted by the shadowy forces of an alien conspiracy.
