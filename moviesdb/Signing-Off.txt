Signing Off

 It's the late 1950s, and the DJ of a nostalgic radio program, out-of-date in the time of the Beatles, has just been fired. On his last broadcast, he decides to play requests, and a loyal listener (according to his ratings, just about his only listener) asks for her late husband's favorite song. But when fate intervenes, the DJ has to prove just how far he'll go to make his biggest fan happy.
