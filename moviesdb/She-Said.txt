She Said

 Is there such a thing as a mother and daughter that get along, or a perfect daughter? Mothers try to get their daughters' to communicate with them, while daughters want freedom and space to act how they want, and be whatever they want to be. What if there was such a thing as the more gentle side from rowdy teenage daughters? What if it was possible that what is seen on the surface is not even close to who they truly are? Is there more to just judging people by how they behave, when all you need to do is see what they act like when they are at home.
