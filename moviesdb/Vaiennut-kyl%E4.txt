Vaiennut kylä

 After his predecessor on a long-festering wilderness village murder case resigns for "reasons of health", a young police detective decides it's time for more forceful methods. But there's still those "we don't know nuthin" villagers to contend with, and ultimately his own personal lust for revenge. Based on a true story.
