Romy and Michele

 This time around it's 1987, and new high school graduates Romy and Michele are desperate to get away from their hometown of Tucson, Arizona. Their goal is to leave their square town behind and be amongst the beautiful, hip people in Hollywood, California, where they can realize their dream of socializing with the rich and famous. Their lives would be complete if they could just get into the celebrity-laden Ozone, the hottest nightclub in Los Angeles. It takes them three years to save up enough money, and find the right outfits to wear, but once in Hollywood, the lovable and lucky duo's escapades lead them to a cast of characters who keep their lives from being anything but square. Back in 1990, ditsy high school graduates, Romy and Michele, move to Los Angeles to try to make lives for themselves and find one complication after another in their quest for finding romance, excitement, and getting into a famous nightclub.
