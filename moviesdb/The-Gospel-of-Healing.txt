The Gospel of Healing

 The Gospel of Healing profiles four outstanding models of faith-based HIV-AIDS prevention, treatment and care services primarily serving African-American communities. It explores how these influential groups were established, what services they provide and their common views on faith, healing and the role of the black church as a source of social leadership. The presentation of each model will be followed by insightful social commentary from prominent black HIV-AIDS activists and progressive theologians. The commentary will be led by pioneering, faith-based AIDS activists Pernessa C. Seele, Founder of The Balm In Gilead, Inc., and Bishop Yvette Flunder, Founder of Ark of Refuge Church in San Francisco, California. The Gospel of Healing is powerful film that highlights socially progressive ways African-Americans can heal their communities.
