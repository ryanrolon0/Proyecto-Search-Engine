The War Bridegroom

 A young man about to be married goes out celebrating with his friend on the night before his wedding. They wind up getting arrested and sentenced to jail. Embarrassed, they send word home that they've been drafted into the army. Trouble ensues when, after they're released, the sheriff discovers they still have two days left to serve and sets out to bring them back.
