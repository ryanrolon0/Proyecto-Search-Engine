Soir bleu

 Ten-year-old Eloise lives with her mother in a large house surrounded by wheat fields, on the outskirts of a town. Her older brother, who is often absent, has come to visit them. He must leave that same evening. Following an argument between her brother and mother, Eloise runs outside to hide. During her wandering, she witnesses a serious road accident.
