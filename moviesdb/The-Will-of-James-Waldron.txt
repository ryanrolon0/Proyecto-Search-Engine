The Will of James Waldron

 When James Waldron died he divided his will to include his crippled son, William, and his pretty daughter, Mabel, and a son of an old friend. Watkins, his old friend's son, made life miserable for the brother and sister. He frequently kicked and maltreated the cripple and repeatedly insulted the girl. She petitioned one of the cowboys to help her. He interceded and Watkins knocked him down for his pains. Then one day came Ralph Coswell, handsome, strong and with something of a reputation for being able to take care of himself. He and Mabel fell in love at once. The brother confided their trouble to him and he interceded with such good results that Watkins carried a black eye for some time. Watkins, revengeful, determined to kill Ralph. He saw them standing together, slowly pulled his gun and took aim. At the other end of the yard stood the cowboy before mentioned, calmly rolling a cigarette. He dropped his tobacco and paper, slowly pulled his gun and took aim. Another instant and Watkins lay dead on the ground.
