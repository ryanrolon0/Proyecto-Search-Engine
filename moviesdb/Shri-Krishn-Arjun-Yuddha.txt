Shri Krishn Arjun Yuddha

 Chitrasen inadvertently humiliates Gabal Rishi, who approaches Bhagwan Shri Kishan and prays that the former be punished. Kishanji readily agrees to punish Chitrasen by beheading him with the Sudarshan Chakra. When no amount of pleas for mercy are adhered to, a compassionate Subhadra, moved by Chitrangini's plight, asks her spouse, Arjun, to intervene. The later, at first, refuses to take up arms against Kishanji, his friend, but subsequently relents - resulting in war - that will not only end their friendship - but may well also destroy the universe and annihilate Arjun, his brothers and their entire army.
