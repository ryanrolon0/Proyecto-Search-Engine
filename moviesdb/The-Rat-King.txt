The Rat King

 An art film set in the distant future where all out nuclear war has wiped out most of mankind and left the Earth uninhabitable. Those who survived live underground in a brutal and oppressive society. After a satellite crashes somewhere on the Earth's highly toxic surface, a scavenger is sent to retrieve it by any means necessary, but what he does not know is that he may not be alone out there.
