Rhythm of the Rhumba

 This 1945 short from Vitaphone's "Melody Master" series proports to show a typical American city where the Rhumba craze has arrived, although it would take a New York, L. A, or Chicago to support the club shown here. The focus is on native Latin instruments and features Chuy Reyes and his orchestra. The Cuban Diamonds do a dance, Chinta sings a song and the dance team of Antonio Triana and Loa Montez (billed as Triana & Montez) grab the spotlight. The finale is a conga, "Ahi Vieni la Conga". Music includes "Bim, Bam Boom", "Linda Mujer" and "Rhumba Matumba." Original Warners production number is 1306, which was changed to 1803 when the short was reissued on January 2, 1954.
