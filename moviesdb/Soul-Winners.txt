Soul Winners

 Southern exploitation director Ron Ormond (The Exotic Ones; Please Don't Touch Me) and associate producer of the 1950's horror classic The Blob; Russ Doughten have something more in common than cult films... soul winning. Exploring the conversion of two directors into Christian independent filmmaking of the 1970s, Soul Winners chronicles the films (A Thief in the Night; Burning Hell) that scared the "hell" out of church congregations for decades and their lasting effects.
