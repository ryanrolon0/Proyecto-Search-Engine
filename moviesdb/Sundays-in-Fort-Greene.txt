Sundays in Fort Greene

 This is a story about an affluent family living in contemporary multi-cultural New York. It details the lives of two sisters impacted by the traditions and expectations handed down from parent to child, that often cause conflict with the everyday choices they make as adults. It explores the repercussions of failing to be true to ones' self out of fear and misunderstandings. Lastly, it attempts to illustrate what happens in modern families everyday, when communication breaks down. A family divided against itself cannot stand.
