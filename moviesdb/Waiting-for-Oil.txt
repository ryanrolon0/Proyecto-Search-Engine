Waiting for Oil

 More than a month after the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, which started the largest oil spill in United States history, residents of Terrebonne Bay had remained extremely lucky. Natural currents continued to pull the oil east away from their fishing estuaries, providing residents with a sense of cautious hope that perhaps their community might be spared from the ravages of the oil. As hurricane season approached however, residents not only found themselves wrangling with BP for lost revenue but also preparing for 'the worst case scenario'; a major hurricane, which could bring massive amounts of oil deep into their fisheries and possibly into their homes. The appearance of Hurricane Alex in Gulf waters only fuels their fears, and as the winds shift their direction residents struggle to find meaning and prepare themselves for the oil they hoped would never come.
