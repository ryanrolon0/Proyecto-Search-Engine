Solitary

 Two women lie accused and imprisoned in separate but adjoining cell blocks. Never having seen one another, they have formed a bond through the walls that no man can break. Solitary portrays the horror of imprisonment and solitude and human's natural desire for love and affection, even when surrounded by the four walls of solitary confinement.
