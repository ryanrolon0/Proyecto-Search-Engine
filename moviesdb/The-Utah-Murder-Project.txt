The Utah Murder Project

 Inspired by actual events, this dark suspense thriller is a fictional account of actress Darcy Gold's sudden and mysterious abduction, thirty miles outside Kanab, Utah. After Darcy is kidnapped and held for ransom, her ex-lover, L.A. narcotics Detective Charlie DeSantis(Oz Perkins)arrives in the small town of Bryerson to investigate. His slick and confident demeanor instantly clashes with the town's hard-edged, no-nonsense Sheriff(Jeff Conaway). When key evidence of Darcy's whereabouts slowly begin to surface, DeSantis and Sheriff Patterson suspect that she may be involved in staging her own kidnapping and ransom.
