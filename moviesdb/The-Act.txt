The Act

 At a comedy club, the Ha Ha Hut, the M.C. introduces the next act, comedian Rosy Marconi. She's approaching middle age, announces she's just gotten a divorce and says, "Please, no pity." She riffs on her ex, Stan, who made laziness a religion. The audience loves it. The film jumps back and forth between her performance and later that night as she stands alone in her unlit kitchen, gift baskets on the table. She smokes, she drinks whisky. The set ends, to great applause, and, at home, she finishes her nightly chores. What is the real source of her material?
