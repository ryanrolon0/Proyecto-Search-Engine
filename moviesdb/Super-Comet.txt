Super Comet

 In a half-documentary, half-movie format we go from just days before the comet makes landfall to months after when those left behind move on to make a new world in the face of what could have ended it all. 'Super Comet' follows these events as seen through the eyes of people in various locations world wide, from a family in Paris, France to a tribe of pygmies in Cameroon everyone is effected.
