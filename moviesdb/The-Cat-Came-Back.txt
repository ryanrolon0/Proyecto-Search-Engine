The Cat Came Back

 Animated illustration of the folksong, "The Cat Came Back," sung by a quartet. Old Mr. Johnson, at 80-plus years, sits in his bed sit playing his tuba when someone leaves a small yellow cat on his doorstep. The cat is destructive, so Old Mr. Johnson puts it back on the doorstep. The cat comes back through the mail slot. Then Johnson tries the woods, the sea, a helium balloon, and a scenic railway. Each time, Old Mr. Johnson takes the brunt of the adventure and the cat returns more destructive than before. Finally it's time for dynamite. Nine lives anyone? Mee-ouch.
