The Car That Became a Star

 At a 1965 international auto show in New York City, the key attraction is not a new car but a 35 year old 1930-vintage brilliant yellow colored Phantom II Rolls-Royce limousine. It's claim to fame is that it is the star of the MGM feature film _The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964)_ (qv). For filming, the automobile traveled from London to northern Italy (Pisa and Florence) to Austria to Yugoslavia, along the way encountering it's several co-stars including 'Rex Harrison (I)' (qv) and 'Jeanne Moreau' (qv) in London, 'Shirley Maclaine' (qv), 'George C. Scott' (qv), 'Art Carney' (qv) and 'Alain Delon' (qv) in Italy, and 'Ingrid Bergman (I)' (qv) and 'Omar Sharif' (qv) in Austria and Yugoslavia. The limo also encountered many fans interested both in the filming and the vehicle itself. During filming, the limo was well taken care of by a large maintenance crew. In its post filming life, the limousine has even inspired a fashionable clothing line by designer Joan Leslie in, of course, the famous yellow motif. This promotional film showcases the automobile whose adventures are chronicled in _The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964)_ (qv). After the car is filmed in various European shooting locations, it becomes the star attraction in an international automobile show in New York City. We even see a fashion show whose colors and styles are based on the 1930 model vehicle.
