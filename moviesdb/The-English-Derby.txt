The English Derby

 "This is a remarkable picture of one of the greatest races of the past century. The horses are seen in the distance galloping under the lash in the final rush for the wire, and at the conclusion of the picture the camera is swept across the field, showing the enormous crowd of spectators which attends this great event."
