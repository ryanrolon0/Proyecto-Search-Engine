The KickBack

 A comedy about two best friends in college living together. They wake up and start their day preparing for a party they are throwing later on that day. They interact with different characters and each character adds their own unique dynamics to the flow of the day. During the final preparation the main characters discover there has been a mis-communication and one key element of the party is missing. They then leave on a journey to get it and throughout the remainder of the day things keep taking a turn for the worst and prolonging what started out as their simple 'KickBack'
