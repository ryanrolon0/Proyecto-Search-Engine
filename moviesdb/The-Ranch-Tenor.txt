The Ranch Tenor

 Wm. Steers fell in love with Young Widow Smith, whose ranch adjoined his own and, knowing that she was fond of music, organized a trio composed of his foreman, a Mexican cowboy and himself, to serenade her. The singing of the foreman irritated the widow and she abruptly stopped the vocal efforts of the trio with a bucket of cold water. The next day she wrote the ranchman that if he wanted to serenade her he should leave that 'bum' tenor at home. Although his foreman had been with him for years, he discharged him, employing in his place a young cowboy of remarkable vocal powers, and with the new tenor, his next serenade was a musical triumph. The widow was highly pleased and as a mark of favor, gave him a rose and the trio returned home rejoicing. His happiness was short lived for the widow admired the new tenor and sent him a note to call upon her--alone. When Wm. Steers called to pay his respects to the fickle widow he found her in the arms of his new foreman. Mounting his horse he goes out to seek his old foreman, and comes upon his camp on the prairie. He finds ready sympathy when he tells his troubles to his old friend.
