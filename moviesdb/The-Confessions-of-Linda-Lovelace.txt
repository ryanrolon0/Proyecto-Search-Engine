The Confessions of Linda Lovelace

 "Linda Lovelace" (played by a double whose face is never shown) interviews for a job as the concubine of a sultan (Harry Reems). Flashbacks attesting to her experience are represented by clips from Deep Throat. It is only in these clips that the actual Linda Lovelace appears.
