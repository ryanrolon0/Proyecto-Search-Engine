The Young American

 "The Young American" follows 27 year-old Garret Savage as he begins his 13 year campaign for the Presidency of the United States. His first campaign stop is in Santa Monica, CA and the Venice Boardwalk. His goal is to represent the Everyman of America. With no platform or definite opinions, Savage quickly figures out that he can campaign to six year olds as they will be old enough to vote in 2012.
