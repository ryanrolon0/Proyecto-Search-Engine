The Chinese Conjurer and the Devil's Head

 A Chinese conjurer steps upon the stage and produces a huge and hideous head which appears to be a cross between a dog and a man. The head goes through various facial expressions, frowning, and working its eyes in a hideous and most frightful manner, twisting its mouth in unbelievable shapes. The conjurer then commands the head to leave the stage, which it does, moving about apparently without the aid of body, arms or legs.
