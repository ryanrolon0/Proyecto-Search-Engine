Suzie Washington

 Nana, fleeing the upheavals in the former Soviet republic that is her home, heads for the USA, where she has an uncle. Her plan is thwarted when her travel documents are inspected at Vienna airport and revealed as forgeries. Nana manages to escape from the transit lounge at the airport and, now instantly transformed into an illegal immigrant, relies on her wits and the kindness of strangers (typically, lonely men) as she makes her way west.
