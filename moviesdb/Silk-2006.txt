 Emma (Christie Will) returns to her father's home for the first time since his passing to sort through a house full of memories. The recently-worn house coat lying on his bed still smells of his presence. Each room is a time capsule filled with the familiar objects of her childhood. Overwhelmed with grief and in a moment of desperation she makes a drastic decision to cut the ties to her past.
