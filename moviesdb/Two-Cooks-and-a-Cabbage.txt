Two Cooks and a Cabbage

 Grandma gives the task of cooking the cabbage to Sally and Jane, who each gets one half a cabbage to work with. Sally uses very little water to make her cabbage and cooks it for a short time. Jane has her half of the cabbage swimming in water and boils it "for ever such a long time." At dinner time, Alan and David fight over Sally's cabbage, which is delicious. Neither wants to eat Jane's cabbage. Grandma gently admonishes Jane for using so much water.
