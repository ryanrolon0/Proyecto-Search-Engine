Røde ører

 Røde Ører (Awfully Embarrassing) is an everyday story about a boy's first love. About Herman who is head over heels in love, and totally paralyzed by this new emotion. The story is told from inside Herman's head, where fantasy has free reign and where rationality is represented by the super hero Overman - Herman's idol. Overman always has some good advice up his sleeve, while Herman tends to float off in a day dream.
