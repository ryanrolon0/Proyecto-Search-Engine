Wall Rats

 Teenage sport climbers Tori Allen and Scott Cory attempt to become the youngest people to climb Yosemite's El Capitan. However, they've never been more than 100' off the ground. How they'll respond to a multi-day adventure up a 3,000 foot wall is anybody's guess. With very little planning, they embark on a 5-day adventure into history.
