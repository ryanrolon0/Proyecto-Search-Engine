Relatively Speaking

 This program tells the life and career of Joe Dumars from the point of view of family, friends, teammates, and colleagues. From the streets of Nachitoches, LA to the Bad Boys of Detroit to the front office of the Pistons, we see the rise of the quiet shooting guard from humble beginnings. Isiah Thomas, Chuck Daly, Michael Jordan and others show us how Dumars touched their lives.
