The Luckiest Guy in the World

 Handsome guy 'Lucky' has it all, sports car, big house, beautiful wife, money and good job. Ordinary guy 'Kev' has beat up car, rented house, no money, and factory job. Two sides of life are acted out on the golf course but everything changes when Lucky and Kev get home.
