The Fall of Adam

 The Fall of Adam is an urban regeneration of Adam's fall from grace. Taking the story to new hi-rise heights and wrestling his descent down through the inferno, he finds his once beautiful eve has turned from the divine to the bovine. A bloody fight with a fat guy in stained underwear (Satan) ends Adam's fall. His body descends the endless flights to his death. He turns back to the dust in which he was created.
