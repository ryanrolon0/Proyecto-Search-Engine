Swerve

 A businessman in white shirt and tie drives alone on an isolated country road. He swerves for a passing truck and the result is a blowout. As he's changing the tire, an unseen assailant knocks him out. He awakes a few yards from the road, a large snake directly in front of him. The car's gone. He hitches to a diner where he sees his car in the parking lot, a backpack on the back seat. He enters the diner and watches the patrons. He makes a phone call. Is the sword of justice about to fall? Who's holding it?
