The Boy from Hell

 Young Daniel has been sent away to a home for troubled teens by his mother, who claims it's to protect him from his long- missing father. The father eventually returns and, despite his wife's plans, discovers where his son is being hidden away. It turns out that Daniel's father is actually a demon who wants to take possession of his body and begin a murderous rampage. As the body count starts to rise, only fellow inmate Charlie notices the change that has come over Daniel, but will he be able to convince anyone of what is happening before he becomes the next victim?
