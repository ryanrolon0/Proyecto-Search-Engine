Vaud and the Villains

 Three members of an 18-piece, 1930's style, American folk big band explore their personal relationships with Los Angeles, performing, the music they love, and the band that binds them all together. Combined with various musical vignettes that showcase the talents of the entire ensemble, this film leaves us with a better understanding of how music can transform both those who create it and those who experience it.
