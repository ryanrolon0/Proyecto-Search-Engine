 We are all driven by our own insanity. Daniel Wong (played my Matthew Tran) is being question about accidentally murdering his housemate Jacob (played by Ivan Ye). Silent Motion will take you through the story of Daniel Wong and Jacob in a short littered with twists that will bring the audience to question 'what is reality?' and 'what is insanity?'
