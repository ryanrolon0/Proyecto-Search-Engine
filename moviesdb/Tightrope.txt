Tightrope

 An insightful, witty look at two constants of adolescence -- being In High School and being In Love. The picture opens as three couples, each representing a different capacity of the constant, entering the classroom of Dr. Lucas. An expert on love and walking the proverbial tightrope. He'll guide these 'representations' through a lecture about what it means to Fall In Love and the repercussions or consequences or mere happenstance that follows such an emotional connection. The young couples learn that the rest of their 'love'life is waiting -- whether they fall off of or actually do manage their way across the pubescent Tightrope everything is inherently different and or new.
