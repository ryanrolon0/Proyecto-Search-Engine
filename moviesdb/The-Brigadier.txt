The Brigadier

 Two brothers living in Russia find themselves separated by adversity with one imprisoned in a Gulag and the other fleeing to the United States. Life deals them very different hands but both ultimately find themselves on opposing sides in the US in a war against crime in which family loyalties are tested to the limit and in a struggle in which there can be no winners.
