The Spy Ring

 The absence of stagecoaches and covered wagons didn't keep director Joseph H. "Wagon Wheel" Lewis from employing his usual camera set-ups of shooting scenes from behind and through various props and fixtures, and the inclusion of a polo game enabled him to get his usual "hitching post" shot, in addition to shooting over and through automobile hood ornaments, champagne bottles, balloons and mirror reflections. The source that dubbed this one in the "musical" genre obviously never saw the film, as there are no songs and only a rinky-dink piece of music used at the Officer's Club dance. This one is about a gang of independent spies after a cigar-shaped device that guarantees accuracy on artillery and large weapons. The spies are headed by Paul Douglas, Jean Bruce and Frank Denton, while Captain Todd Hayden is the protector of the device, and in love with the Colonel's daughter, Elaine Burdette. Most of the action is placed at the Presido in Montery and most of it revolves around the outcome of a polo match between the Cavalry team and a civilian team called "The Rainbows", which star player Hayden has to throw in order to catch the spies.
