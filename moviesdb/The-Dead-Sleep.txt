The Dead Sleep

 It could be that, after death, our spirits need to forget this world. Or maybe something in our mortalities is worth fighting for, even worth dying for a second time. In this supernatural thriller, Paul Wells plans to find out. His body has been in a grave for five years while his spirit witnesses the consequences of his transgressions. Driven to save his daughter from his unfortunate mistakes, Paul twists the boundary between the living and the dead.
