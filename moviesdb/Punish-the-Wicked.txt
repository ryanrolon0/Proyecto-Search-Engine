Punish the Wicked

 Eight bible school teens arrive at the Evangelical Senior Center expecting a week of visiting, long walks, and old people food. They are unaware that their faith is about to be tested. Jacob (Dennis Clarke) and Sarow (Keila Collins), run the establishment with a strict interpretation of the laws set forth in the bible. The slightest infractions are dealt with harshly. When the more severe sinners start to disappear it is up to the ultra faithful youth to find out why and seek their vengeance. With suspense, thrills, horror, and irony, this film illustrates how blind faith can be more perilous than no faith at all.
