The Disciple

 The sun no longer shines and smiles are rarely seen in the town of Keller. But, the oddest thing about the town is no one ever notices. With his town overtaken by sin, Matthew Haulston, a young pastor, calls to Jesus for help. The next morning a mysterious man is found lying dirty and naked in the road. The man, Azal, claims to be a direct disciple of God. Immediately, Azal is treated harshly much like Jesus himself was. Because the majority of the townspeople believe that Azal is nothing more than a delusional drifter, his warnings are ignored. As the hours and days pass everyone begins to realize Azul's prophesies are coming true. His powers scare the people and the treatment of Azal becomes even crueler. When their acts become more brutal, the town and its people will be changed forever in ways they never thought imaginable.
