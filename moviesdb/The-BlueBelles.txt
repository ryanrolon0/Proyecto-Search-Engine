The BlueBelles

 The BlueBelles are a group of elderly women who met at a YMCA swim class over twenty years ago and together have forged a unique and long-lasting friendship. They love spending time together, whether swimming, playing cards, or meeting at the local bagel shop to chat. And they take great pleasure in making each other laugh -- which they do often and loudly. However, the Belles are more than just a coffee klatch. Their friendship has sustained these women through life's ups and downs. None of them are strangers to tragedy, and yet they remain upbeat, optimistic, and mostly without regrets. The Belles show us that it is possible to age gracefully surrounded by love and laughter.
