The Man Who Ate His Lover

 The true story of two men and their encounter with each other. One is a German, who is also a cannibal. The other man is from Berlin, who's fetish is to be eaten and killed. They meet up on the Internet, and rendezvous in Germany at the cannibal's mansion. There, the willing-victim is drugged up on painkillers. The cannibal then removes the willing-victim's penis while video-taping the incident. The penis is split down the middle for the two to eat; first trying the penis raw, then cooking it. After the willing-victim has bled to death, the cannibal puts his corpse in a bath for ten hours, then uses the corpse's meat for food.
