We Are the Marines

 The history of the Corps, from Colonial times to the present day (1942, that is). The film's midsection details the arduous training procedure of the Few and the Proud at Parris Island and elsewhere. Finally, wartime newsreel footage is adroitly blended with dramatized re-enactments to illustrate the contributions - and the utter necessity-of the marines in WW II.
