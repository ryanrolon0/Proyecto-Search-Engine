Posing

 Although this movie is about the Playboy magazine, there are no erotic scenes. Instead it tells the story of three women, who seem to have nothing in common professors; Meredith is a married mother and owner of a bowling alley; Janet is a successful broker -- yet all of them decide to pose for the Playboy adult magazine, shocking their dears, friends and co-workers. They have to suffer the consequences, but manage to turn it into a precious experience of life.
