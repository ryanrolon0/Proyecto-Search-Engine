The Revelation of Reverend Jones

 The Reverend Jones is a popular, Welsh vicar. Those with suspicions about his love of Hollywood grand dames say nothing - until he is spotted in drag outside a nightclub in Soho. Then his parishioners turn against him. The vicar makes a public statement by erecting a large pink cross outside his church. Things can only get worse.
