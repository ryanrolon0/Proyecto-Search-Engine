Tattle Tail

 Cathleen (Cathleen Mason) and Kevin (Kevin Hoagland) have been married for 20+ years. The children are all grown up and moved out leaving the couple as new "empty-nesters". With all this time on her hands, Cathleen starts to notice Kevin has a flaw she can't put up with for another 20+ years. Based on Edgar Allen Poe's "Tell Tale Heart".
