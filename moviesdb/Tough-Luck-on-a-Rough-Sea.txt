Tough Luck on a Rough Sea

 A young man books passage on a ship for himself and his fiancEe to escape the police, who are looking for him. After the ship sails, he runs into a passenger who turns out to be a man he cheated and set adrift--his father. The father plans revenge on his double-crossing son, first by trying to steal his fiancEe from him, and then by more sinister means. However, the ship suddenly runs into a fierce storm, and it's every man for himself.
