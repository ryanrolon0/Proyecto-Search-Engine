Standpoint

 In this short drama set amidst the Iraq War, injured Marine, Paul, wakes bloodied in captivity. Paulʼs consciousness dims, flickers and he stirs to discover himself confined to a bed in a military hospital. Jolted by his most recent experiences, Paul is further shaken to find his roommate an Iraqi civilian,Ali. The jovial Ali attempts to befriend his injured counterpart but is met with both alarm and contempt. As their first day together marches forward, Ali continues to press Paul for companionship, offering the bedridden Paul a description of what lies beyond their hospital room window. Paulʼs animosity wanes when Aliʼs description unwittingly strikes a cord within his injured peer. In a move of uncharacteristic weakness, Paul opens up to Ali only to have their time together cut short and their budding friendship evaporated, leaving Paul with more questions than answers as Ali proves a greater anomaly than he appeared.
