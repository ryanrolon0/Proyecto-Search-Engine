The Warden

 One night, after escorting yet another prisoner to the electric chair, Warden Harrell finds that one of his Death Row inmates is missing. After the inmate appears, he attacks the Warden, frees the other prisoners and starts a riot. The Warden wakes to find that just he and one other prisoner, Elliot, remain. Upon this discovery, Warden Harrell takes Elliot with him as he searches the prison for any other "sign of life". As they walk through the prison, the only other person they find is the man the warden saw being executed the previous night. Together they realize the only possible explanation; they didn't survive the riot. Trapped inside the prison, the two men contemplate what they believe heaven to be like and reminisce about their happiest memories. While reminiscing, they become separated and find themselves at the brink of reliving those cherished events.
