The Cheyenne Cyclone

 Bob Carelton hires on at the O'Brien ranch where O'Brien is in trouble due to the lack of water. After Flash Corbin has O'Brien's water supply poisoned, Bob brings in a well driller. But Flash pays him to not find water and while Bob is away, brings in an actress to buy the ranch from the now discouraged O'Brien.
