The Medicine

 From the living room of the 102 year old inventor of LSD, Albert Hofmann, to shamanic ayahuasca ceremonies in the Amazon; from the finest medical schools and brain research labs in the world to ibogaine clinics treating heroine addictions with 36 hour sessions, people are being relieved of psychological disturbances. Twenty-first century medical research with psychedelic medicines is proving to be valuable for treating people with post traumatic stress disorder; existential anxiety due to terminal illness and impending death; addiction therapy; and life enhancement with healthy people. Volunteer subjects reveal their permanently life changing experiences while being assisted with specially trained psychedelic psychotherapists. New technologies - fMRI, PET scans, and biofeedback equipment show what these substances do while volunteers have extraordinary healing experiences.
