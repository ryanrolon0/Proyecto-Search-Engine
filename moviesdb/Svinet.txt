Svinet

 Christmas peace in Stig Larsson's way. A Christmas tale about a family which isn't quite like everybody else. Or maybe they really are... A beautiful facade can hide so much. Like the popular and complacent TV-meteorologist Arvid has a half alcoholic wife, Charlotte, and a wounded daughter, Lisa, who has given birth to a son which Lisa says that he is the father to. This happy family will celebrate Christmas with Arvid's best friend Sune, detective superintendent, and his wife Cholatom, who Sune found in Thailand.
