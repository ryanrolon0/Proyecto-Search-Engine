Wake Up, Freak Out

 Hardly anyone seems to have noticed that the newest climate science suggests we are about to pass the point of no return, to unstoppable, catastrophic global warming. This short animation explains the positive feedback mechanisms that mean the Earth's climate system has a tipping point, followed by a brief glimpse into the crystal ball of horrors that will almost certainly come to pass if we cross it. Finally, the film explores how we got into the mess we're in, and the possibilities still open to us to prevent the worst natural and humanitarian disaster in human history, and the very real possibility of the end of civilization, and of life as we know it.
