The Gay Intruders

 When the curtain comes down on the great stage romantic team of John Newberry and his wife Maria Ivar, their criticisms of each other's acting abilities sets off a domestic battle of clashing tempers and temperaments. Their manager, Charles MacNulty, tired of the constant bickering, suggests psychiatry. John secretly confers with Dr. Harold Matson and Maria, also secretly, sees Dr. Susan Nash. Matson poses as an old college pal of John's while Susan is introduced as Maria's sister when they meet in the Newberry home where they have come to observe their patients. Each doctor, at first, assumes the other to be the patient. Maria soon suspects Susan of having an unprofessional interest in John, while John does the same for Matson regarding Maria. Progress is made and John and Maria discover how wonderful it is to be able to say nice things to each other. MacNulty arrives with a play about a temperamental wife and a lying cad of a husband, and John and Maria refuse to play such unsavory characters. The enraged MacNulty accuses the psychiatrists of ruining the best acting talent in the country and, with the doctor's true identities revealed, John and Maria denounce each other as the smiling MacNulty watches the verbal battle.
