The Brand

 Jim Haroll was a blacksmith. He lived alone with his old father until the matrimonial bee lodged securely in his curly head. Then Jim found a copy of "Cupid's Darts," fell madly in love with an advertised beauty, and sent for her to share his hearth and fortune. One year tired the beauty. A perfumery salesman called one day and Jim, glancing through the window, beheld her in his arms. In blind rage he rushed to his forge, seized a red-hot iron and pushing his wife's betrayer to the floor branded him upon the cheek.
