Probed

 Carter Fox, a senior at Irving High in Phoenix Arizona, is obsessed with UFO lore- particularly the "Phoenix Lights" phenomenon of 1997. Chrissy Daniels, a model student and sophomore has been assigned to tutor Carter so that he can pass biology and graduate. When Carter sees a news story about a group of lights hovering over downtown Phoenix, he rushes to the scene with his new tutor in hopes of capturing proof. He finds that even hard proof does not persuade easily. In this homage to the TV series The X Files, Probed explores the struggles in the pursuit of proof of the paranormal.
