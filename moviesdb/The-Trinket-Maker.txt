The Trinket-Maker

 High up in the sky, the trinket-maker lives. His house is packed with the beautiful metal objects he creates. The trinket-maker isn't very fond of the ground, only visiting to search trash cans for valuable parts. Normally when he hears a noise, as fast as possible he returns to his house. This time it is different though. As usual he escapes, but now he hears singing. It enchants him.
