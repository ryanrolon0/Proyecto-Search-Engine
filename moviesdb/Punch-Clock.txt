Punch Clock

 Poignant and honest, this documentary follows several people in Southeast Kansas who reveal past choices, shattered dreams, and dissatisfying careers. It provides an intimate look at how people end up working jobs they hate and what blocked them from pursuing their dreams and ambitions. Punch Clock is the directorial debut for both Nathan Cheney and Chance Luttrell. After winning "Best Short Documentary" at Southern Winds Film Festival in Oklahoma, the two decided to move forward with developing the story alongside successful network television producer Jerry Whitworth. While being mentored by the television veteran, Nathan and Chance realized how much they had to learn about filmmaking. After passionately developing "Punch Clock" for over three years the young directors finally felt their story was one that would resonate with the world.
