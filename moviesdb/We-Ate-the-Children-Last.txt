We Ate the Children Last

 "Patient D" is dying. He is the first chosen recipient of a pot-bellied pig gastrointestinal xenograft that cures him of his disease. His tastes changes from sweets and spice, to refuse-stinking garbage.Patient D is the picture of health. Pop star Ricky Rodgers is the first to have the operation completed for non-medical reasons. The procedure catches on among the chic and the radical. The telltale mark is a scar at the base of the neck, a badge worn with pride. Ricky Rodgers consumes his own drum tech. A media maelstrom drives a wedge of fear between the operated and unoperated. Riots, protests, death. The government is swift to react. With the support of an enraged majority, the army descends upon every one of the operated, without discrimination between the law-abiding and the criminal.
