The Killing Hand

 Walking in the shadow of his past, Bruce searches for purpose and acceptance on the streets of the city. They are home to the Killing Hand - a band of thieves and killers whose ruthless leader conspires to rule the city through intimidation and fear. Bruce must endure the trials of the gang, and face the painful truth of his past. His only hope of salvation is the priest who took pity on him. Can he truly repent, or will he surrender and pursue sin like an addiction? It is said that there is evil inherent in all men. Some renounce it. Others embrace it. How far would you go to justify your evil?
