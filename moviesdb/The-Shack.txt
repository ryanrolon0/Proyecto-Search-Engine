The Shack

 The story of a young woman's journey to face her tumultuous and abusive childhood, which took place within the confines of a run-down shack in rural Australia. Set in the 1960's and in her memories of the 1940's, she re-explores growing up in the shack and must make a choice; hold on to the pain of the past or accept, forgive and move on with her life.
