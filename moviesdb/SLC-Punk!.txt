SLC Punk!

 Two punks live in Salt Lake City. The film covers their all-day routine. The realism of the character-narrated movie may be discussed. One of the punks gets ill, stays in hospital for three weeks, comes out again. Three parties are covered and one concert including a fight between punks, rednecks and others. SLC Punk is a film about a couple of kids who become sick of their dull, ordinary life. They make plans to try to change things and create anarchy.
