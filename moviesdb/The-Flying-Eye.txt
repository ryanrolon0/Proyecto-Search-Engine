The Flying Eye

 Colonel Audacious is an inventor and with the help of his young assistant, Barnstuffer, he invents a model aeroplane with a TV camera attached that can then fly around revealing all sorts of goings on. After a few slapstick goofs the flying eye reveals the activities of a gang of spies.
