Shut Up and Kiss Me

 A modern day take on the trials and tribulations of dating. We follow Ben as he faces the world of dating as a 35 year old who is looking for more then sex. After testing out different routes and adventures, he stumbles across Grey. The chemistry between the two is instant, but what happens when you meet someone who doesn't share the same beliefs about relationships that you do? This funny and touching film touches on relevant topics in today's society including sexual monogamy, Serodiscordant relationships and can someone really have it all? Written by Ronnie Kerr, this film is an autobiographical look at his life.
