Voodoo Love

 When it comes to love, Jay Shannon has tried it all yet remains perpetually single. He accepts a box from a mysterious woman and discovers a voodoo doll inside. In a last ditch attempt to attract love, he sticks in far too many pins and trashes the box when nothing immediately happens. Jay's attempt to give the box back is refused and suddenly, admirers began flocking to him. Eventually realizing that his approach to finding love has been all wrong, Jay returns home and discovers that sometimes you stumble upon exactly what you seek as soon as you stop looking.
