Queen of the Fluids

 'Queen of the Fluids' is an experimental, non-narrative surrealist video. Through rain falling backwards, a golden queenly being rises up. In a poetic introductory scene, the gold drips out of ther body, and her eyes are shed. Entering through the eerily empty orbs into her brain, we discover a metaphysical kingdom - a world of liquidity. From there we are led through the mind into an 'under-reality', finally arriving in the pure abstraction of consciousness.
