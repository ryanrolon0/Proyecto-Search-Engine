The Shadow Project

 The Shadow Project tells how a single mom's quest to help her dyslexic son inspired a foundation that has helped more than 5,500 students with disabilities succeed in school. At her son's request, the program was named for his dog. My film looks at the struggles and successes of these kids, who, despite tremendous potential, are at the highest risk of later dropping out of school. This film also tells The Shadow Project's unique story through the children who participate. The story is empowering for them because it is the only one they know in which the disabled kid gets to be the hero. The Shadow founder has volunteered more than 11,000 hours; her son, now grown, visits special education classrooms.
