Van-Hellhessian

 After an unexpected knock at the door on Halloween night, Brian discovers his friend Neil, waiting impatiently on the doorstep, dressed in a ridiculous Scarecrow costume for a party, which Brian appears to have forgotten. After a brief row, the pair decide to stay in and watch a film, with Neil stubbornly remaining in costume.
