Post Military Trip

 Ever wonder why about 70% of the world's best trance music DJ's are Israeli? Can you envision why about 60,000 Israelis coming out of the army every year travel to Goa, India to wind down from the Army? Post Military Trip (P.M.T) is a film that depicts a vibrant sub-culture in Israel of tolerance, alternative spirituality, and ground-shaking parties. Shot throughout Israel and Goa, India, P.M.T portrays a society escaping the harsh realities of the Middle East conflict. The parallels to American hippies in the sixties voicing their disapproval of the Vietnam war are unmistakable - and the visuals are equally stunning.
