The Knockout

 Mickey Malarkey Daniels, a bashful, freckle-faced Elmira College freshman, who's already suffered humiliation at the hands of the sophomores, has never done two things of one of those voids, Mickey discovers he can punch with power. He's put forward the next day as the Great Frosh Hope against the sophomore's champion, Slug Mulligan. Mary might have to do her part more than once, as Mickey faces Slug. Are girls an advantage or a distraction at ringside?
