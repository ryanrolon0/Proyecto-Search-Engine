Top Secret!

 This time Zucker and Abrams are spoofing, most notably, Elvis films and WWII spy movies. Val Kilmer stars as Nick Rivers, a handsome American 50s-style rock and roll singer. While performing in East Germany, he falls in love with a beautiful heroine and becomes involved with the French Resistance. American rock star Nick Rivers teams up with the lovely Hillary Flammond to escape capture by the East German High Command. They don't have long, as Rivers and Flammond must try to find her father, in order to stop him from creating the ultimate super weapon, known as 'the Polaris Mine'. A host of characters join them, including DEjà Vu and Chocolate Mousse.
