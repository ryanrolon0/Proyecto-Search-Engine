Road Reps

 David Gram, a pharmaceutical sales rep, takes advantage of an opportunity to win over a client set in a remote territory, which would make him top sales rep of the year. This is the genesis of the idea for an all out business mixed with pleasure road trip/surf safari up the California coast with his four buddies in a classic 1950 Ford Woody. Along the way, David is outraged when he encounters his estranged wife, whose newly acquired job as sales rep for his competitor, is on her way to win the same client. The race is on.
