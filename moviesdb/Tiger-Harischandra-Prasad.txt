 Peasant who produces the raw food for us is the least cared section by the government. The middlemen buy raw products from peasants at a very minimal price and sell it at higher level at big price. In the process, the middlemen and industrialists are making huge profits and the peasants are not even earning enough money to support their daily bread and butter needs.
