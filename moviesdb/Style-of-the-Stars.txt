Style of the Stars

 Mel Allen provides the narration while stars of the golf course, the baseball diamond (where all the players wear baseball caps and none wear baseball hats since there was no such item), and aquatic performers in Florida show off their skills and style. Golfer Patty Berg hits a few golf balls, while the American and National League All-Stars (all wearing baseball caps and none wearing baseball hats) show their wares at the All-Star Game in Boston.
