Six Bend Trap

 Europe's richest greyhound race takes place at Peterborough's Fengate Stadium. However, trainers and owners will not find this six-bend contest listed in any racing calendar as it is the dramatic final scenes of the new feature film, Six Bend Trap, already being dubbed a 'cult classic', with the final scenes actually shot at Peterborough Stadium. Billed as a cross between The Full Monty and Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, the gritty drama stars former East End gangster Dave Courtney. The film's creator and writer is Mike McCarthy, whose television credits include Boys From The Blackstuff and Spender added but it is not a gangster film and the integrity of greyhound racing is not compromised. The film's plot centres on a ruthless, rich businessman, Gordy Metcalf, who is played by Dave Courtney, who owns the best greyhound in the country. An ex-trainer sets a trap for three young men from a poor estate in North East England, who go on to train a dog which takes on the businessman's greyhound in a match-race at the Peterborough final. And the final is run over Fengate's six bends - hence the film's title.
