Shy

 Lewis, a 12 year-old, agoraphobic, African-American boy lives in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, with his Grandmother. Lewis is a unique kid, and spends his time looking out the window, listening to old political speeches. When his Grandmother dies he goes outside and makes an unlikely friend, in the form of 16-year old petty thief, Javi.
