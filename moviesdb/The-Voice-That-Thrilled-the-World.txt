The Voice That Thrilled the World

 Warner Brothers pays tribute to the history of sound recording, to talking pictures, and to itself. Fresh from its "Yankee Doodle Dandy" Oscar for sound, Warner Brothers celebrates those who's work brought the world from research to sound recordings and from there to a movie with a musical score ("Don Juan"), film with synchronized sound ("Jazz Singer" and "Vesti la giubba"), and the first all-talking picture, "Lights of New York." Film clips celebrate Ethel Waters' singing, Paul Muni's biopics, Bette Davis and Gary Cooper's Oscars (plus Sgt. York speaking English, French, and Italian), and World War II newsreels and training films. Cagney's Oscar 100 years in development.
