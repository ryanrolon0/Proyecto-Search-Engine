Pour aimer, encore

 For seven consecutive days, an unsuspecting woman, Isidora Salazar, receives anonymous gifts from a romantic stranger. Each gift has a message attached written in French. She is flattered, surprised, yet curious of the thoughtful sender. She begins a search of suspected admirers by attempting to translate the messages and calls ex-boyfriends, interests, and crushes. When her leads toward finding her admirer fall short and her translations prove to be inaccurate, Isidora decides she will be patient and wait for her admirer to reveal himself to her one day. As each day passes, Isidora receives a different gift and message. On the final day, Isidora finally meets Jean Jacques, her admirer, and soon discovers that her secret admirer's acts of romance are not based simply on infatuation, but the pursuit of a greater redemption.
