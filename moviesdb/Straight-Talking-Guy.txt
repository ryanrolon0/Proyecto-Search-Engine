Straight Talking Guy

 Andy's candid, unconventional and often confrontational approach to speaking is lent from his martial arts, and really creates an electric atmosphere when he takes center stage. If you're interested in personal development, see how one person transformed himself from a teenage nobody, into a world respected martial artist and international speaker. Straight Talking Guy' is the first promotional documentary from RedScar, about martial artist, therapist, and motivational speaker, Andy Gibney. Find out how Andy merges these three worlds into one; how he got there, and where he's going - as one of the most interesting and thought provoking speakers on the circuit.
