The Adventures of Ociee Nash

 For the young, spirited nine-year-old Ociee Nash, nothing could be more exciting than romping through her beloved Mississippi countryside with her brother, Ben, and her faithful four-legged companion, "Woofer." But Ociee's idyllic life is thrown into a tailspin when her Papa realizes that since the death of Ociee's mother, and Ociee's run-in with a mysterious Gypsy, the rough and tumble world of their rural farm is not the place for Ociee to be growing up. Reluctantly, Papa decides it is time to send Ociee to Asheville, N.C., where her Aunt Mamie can teach her to become "a young lady." With a heavy heart, Ociee boards the train bound for her uncertain new life far from the home she's always known. Once on her way, it's not long before Ociee meets an array of interesting (and renowned) characters including the world's pioneering female investigative journalist Nellie Bly, Orville and Wilbur Wright, and even the President of the United States, William McKinley, for whom Ociee inspires a campaign slogan. Upon arriving in Asheville, Ociee and Aunt Mamie quickly find there are two sides to every story. Trading in dungarees for dresses, Ociee tries her best to adjust, but finds herself compelled to hold onto her spirited heart. Ociee befriends the proper young Elizabeth Murphy and the pair is soon in over their heads with a trip to the creek and a daring meeting with Harry Vanderbilt and his friends. Just when Aunt Mamie seems more determined than ever that Ociee conform to stricter standards, Mamie's soft heart is revealed when her childhood friend, Mr. Lynch, visits over for Sunday dinner on the invitation of Ociee. Ociee's true bravery, character and spirit come to the forefront when a fire at the Murphy house threatens the life of young Elizabeth Murphy. A triumphant "Ociee Nash Day" celebration ensues to everyone's delight.
