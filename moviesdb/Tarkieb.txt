Tarkieb

 The headless body of Roshni (Tabu), a nurse at a military hospital is found in a river. After the local police are intimidated to drop the case, an investigator, Patel (Patekar), from the CID is sent in to take charge. Patel finds a number of suspects, including Roshni's many admirers Ajit (Soman), Multani (Pancholi), Bishen (Mishra), and Dogra (Rana). A dhoban finds a hand in a creek where she was washing clothes. She and other dhobis nearby gather together and summon the police. After an investigation, the police find various parts of this body, and determine it to be that of a young woman. They do not succeed in finding the head of the corpse, and a check with missing persons produces negative results. When Inspector Pyare Mohan, who was assigned to this investigation, receives a threat by an anonymous caller on the phone, he recommends that this file be closed. Then additional evidence surfaces, and the case if turned over to CBI Office Jasraj Patel, who along with his assistant, Gangaram, arrive to take over this investigation. They find out that the corpse is indeed of a young woman, Roshni Choubey. Ms. Choubey comes from a poor family of four unmarried sisters. Ms. Choubey seemed to be involved with several men, including Dr. Kamal Dogra; Mohan Multani; Captain Ajit Verma; and Bhishan Nanda - all of who have a motive for killing her and disposing off her body. Who is the real killer - is the challenge that now faces Jasraj, apart from the telephonic threat that he too has received from the anonymous caller, who could well be the killer.
