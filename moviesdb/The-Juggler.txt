The Juggler

 A Charlie Chaplinesque young man too shy to talk practices his juggling skills (unsuccessfully) as he prepares for his girlfriend's high school party. Upon arriving at the house, he is clearly shy & uncomfortable, surrounded by high school studs, nerds, and the like. After being hit up for beer money several times and witnessing the mother's surprising early return, he goes to the refrigerator and takes out 3 eggs attempting to charm a saddened redhead. His clumsiness takes a turn for the better as he learns to juggle the different personalities in his life.
