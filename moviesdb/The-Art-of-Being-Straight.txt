The Art of Being Straight

 John thinks he's got it all figured out. He's young, good looking and has always had a way with the ladies. After a break-up with his girlfriend, he moves west to Los Angeles for a fresh start. He is officially back on the market and looking to score. Crashing on his buddy Andy's couch is a comforting return to the college patterns of partying, womanizing and trash talk with the guys. However, reconnecting with his old flame Maddie proves to be surprising when she introduces him to her girlfriend, Anna. An aspiring photographer, John takes an entry-level position at an ad agency, determined to prove himself. Things get a little confusing when Paul, a successful executive at the firm, takes a special interest in John, and when John ends up in Paul's bed, his world is turned completely upside down. The Art of Being Straight explores one man's unexpected search for identity. More than just a story of seduction, John's journey to find himself proves to be almost more than he can handle, yet he discovers that accepting the unknown also brings unlimited possibilities.
