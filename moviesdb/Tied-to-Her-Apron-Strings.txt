Tied to Her Apron Strings

 A "sparrow cop" is making love to a nurse girl in the park when the small boy creeps behind the bench and fastens the policeman to the nurse's apron strings. The policeman starts to walk his beat as the Captain comes along, but naturally, he cannot move and the Captain catches him in this awkward predicament.
