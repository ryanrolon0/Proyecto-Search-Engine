Quebec in Summertime

 This travelogue of the Province of QuEbec begins in the City of QuEbec, situated on top of a cliff overlooking the St. Lawrence River. The majestic Chateau Frontenac Hotel, modeled after a 16th century French chateau, dominates the skyline. The city is a mixture of old and new, the market and the horse drawn carriages in the former, and the port activities in the latter. The fortress provides a reminder of the reason for the city, with the physical being making it the only walled city in North America. Nine miles from the city flows Montmorency Falls. Sainte-Anne-de-BeauprE, known as the Lourdes of North America, is a pilgrimage site for many of the Catholic faith. Traveling through agricultural country which is still primarily French speaking, we reach Sainte-Adele Lodge, an example of one of the many year-round resorts in the province. This leads into the city of MontrEal, which is named after Mont Royal, a landmark of the city. It is the largest city in Canada and third largest French speaking city in the world. Despite being eight hundred hundred miles from the Atlantic, it is the second largest seaport in North America. A trip of the province would not be complete without a cruise down the St. Lawrence River, with a side trip up the Saguenay River.
