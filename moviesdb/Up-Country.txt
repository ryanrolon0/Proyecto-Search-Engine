Up Country

 A couple of friends who hire a guide to take them on a fishing trip in a remote part of northern Maine--farther north, even, than the towns they don't bother to name. But, when the guide leaves them stranded in a river and takes their gear, they're stuck in the middle of nowhere with no resources and some locals who aren't too happy that these people are in their woods.
