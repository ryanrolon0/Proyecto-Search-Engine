The Test

 An entire Kenyan community of 50,000 participates in an HIV testing and counseling campaign are provided with a CarePack of products to prevent malaria, HIV and diarrheal disease as encouragement to take an HIV test. For the first time, people line up by thousands to take an HIV test--including adult men, a previously hard to reach group for HIV testing. Stigma of testing and knowing HIV status is reduced. Attitudes towards HIV+ people is confronted and overcome. Film shows how lives of five people change over course of one year from when they learn their status. The CarePack campaign was conceived and funded by a private Swiss company. Results have broad implications for achieving national testing goals and achieving Millennium Development Goals.
