Snowfever

 In an Austrian ski-resort, ruthless Dutch lady-killer Ryan is the cock of the ski-lessons roost, but only accepts advanced Dutch pupils, or he would be swamped with adoring girls; however this year his boss forces him to take beginners too, one of which is a sexually as inexperienced girl. Ryan's younger brother Erik, also gorgeous but far less assertive, gentler and a virgin, has another embarrassing failure to do it with a girl on the train from the Netherlands, ending up peeing in a bottle in girls' sleeping compartment. The good boy bunks with bad big brother, who claims sex-appeal is the key to success as a popular ski instructor. Teachers and pupils go about scheming more for the partner-chase then for winter sports, even at odds with same-sex friendships, but love finds its way...
