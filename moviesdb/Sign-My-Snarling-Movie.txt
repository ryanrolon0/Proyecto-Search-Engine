Sign My Snarling Movie

 Rising from the ashes of San Francisco's Western Onion Singing Telegram Company, the Bobs pave their own path through vocal pyrotechnics, witty tunes, musical brinkmanship, and amazing live shows. The band evolves and changes as they gain an audience, get nominated for a Grammy, tour the world, and manage to thrive for 25 years with no major label support, no hit records, and no instruments.
