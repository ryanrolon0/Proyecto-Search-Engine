Tink's Kitchen

 Uptight Naval Officer Christian 'Tink' Mayberry leaves his old life behind to pursue his dream of running a gastropub. But Tink's approach begins to drive away staff, customers and his family, while his business threatens to sink before it's even launched. Does Tink have what it takes to turn the tides of fortune? In his audacious debut, Writer/Producer/Director Henry Davies captures the bittersweet nature of life through the highs and lows of one man's hopes.
