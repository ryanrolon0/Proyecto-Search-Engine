Vihir

 Sameer and Nachiket are relatives and friends. Nachiket, who is the more mature of the two, wants to escape his stifling surroundings. Sameer does not understand this. Then one day, Nachiket drowns in a pool where they often swam together. His death takes over Sameer's life, as he becomes lost in the fear and meaning of death. No one comes to his help. He must search to learn the meaning of life, however vaguely, on his own.
