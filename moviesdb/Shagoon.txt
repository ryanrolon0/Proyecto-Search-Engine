Shagoon

 Geeta (Waheeda Rehman) and Madan (Kamaljit) are in love with each other and want to marry. They meet each other's parents and subject to the matching of their astrological charts, their engagement is finalized. However, the pandit reports to Madan's mom that the marriage will be ill-fated, and bad things will result for Madan and his family. Madan's mom is opposed to the marriage, however, Madan and Geeta are not superstitious and are determine to marry each other. They do get married, and then one disaster after another befalls Madan's family, his dad, his sister, and his younger brother; which leaves both Geeta and Madan wondering if more disasters are to follow them, and if the Pandit's prophecy is indeed true.
