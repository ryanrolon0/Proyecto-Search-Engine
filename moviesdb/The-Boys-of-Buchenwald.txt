The Boys of Buchenwald

 A "gentle rekindling of the human spirit" brought child survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp out of despair and moved them to create remarkable lives for themselves. In The Boys of Buchenwald, they return to the homes in France which took them in after the war, and reconnect with fellow survivors whose friendships helped to heal their devastating losses.
