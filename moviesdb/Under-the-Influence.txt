Under the Influence

 On the first Friday of the school year, Pete Boslem fails to win back his girlfriend Elizabeth. At the encouragement of his friends, Pete and his buddies decide to crash a party where she will be, only to have it broken up by the police. Split up from running from the cops, the four friends must not only find each other, but find another party. Soon, the typical high school night turns into the night of their lives for four friends who are out of control, over the top, and under the influence.
