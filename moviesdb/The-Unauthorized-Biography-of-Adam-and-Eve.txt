The Unauthorized Biography of Adam and Eve

 In an intense verbal tennis match spanning the four seasons of time, Tyler abstractly tells the story of "the first couple", "Adam" and "Eve". The couple challenges the confines of language while moving about a dimly lit cube-like room. The constant motion, paired with Tyler's witty and provocative language, creates a perfect landscape for the age-old story of love.
