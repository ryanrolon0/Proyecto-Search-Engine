Within the den's lush jungle of lava lamps, power-bongs, hippie tapestries and four insanely stoned-out seniors, Morris discovers that getting old isn't quite as easy as getting high. Eighteen film festivals and a Warner Bros. Pictures Film Production Award later, the eighteen minute movie has emerged a cult favorite at college dorms, office parties and senior citizen centers across the US and Canada.
