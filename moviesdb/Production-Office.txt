Production Office

 In a film production office before an all-night shoot, Jane, the Coordinator, packs up to go home after a long day. But the phone rings, and a chain reaction of events and misadventures are set into motion that force her to stay, and stay, and stay, all night. From missing props and wardrobe to a missing actor, from angry power struggles to sexual misconduct, Jane and her faithful assistant, Justy, manage to navigate these messy, often political waters while keeping their heads up with bawdy humor, off color language, and professional solidarity.
