The Old Army Game

 Private Donald Duck has snuck off base for some unauthorized R&R. But his clever ruse (a dummy and a sound effects record) don't fool Sergeant Pete, who's waiting for him when he sneaks back in. Donald hides in one of three boxes and plays the shell game for a while, until Pete throws the box with Donald along the top of a sharp fence, sawing it in half. Donald lands in a hole, and both he and Pete think he's been sawed in half, for a while. Donald discovers he's OK, but his joy is shortlived when Pete gives chase (a chase slowed considerably by the 35 MPH national speed limit).
