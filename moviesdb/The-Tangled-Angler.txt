The Tangled Angler

 A pelican is going fishing, with a pole and a can of "woims." The fish (apparently the only one in the pond) is too smart for him, and it jumps out of the water and starts heckling. He smokes a cattail like a cigar, using the pelican as an ashtray. He ties the pelican up with his own fishing line, then takes a bath in the bill. Next, the fish sings some opera with the pelican as his gondola. The pelican disguises his rump as a game warden, and has a little argument where he says there are no fish worth catching anyhow; the fish, insulted, falls into the trap and is about to be fried with butter when a bee conveniently attacks the pelican, letting the fish go free.
