The Fergusons

 Bad neighbors force the sweet Fergusons to move from town to town. Bullies, vandals, jealous neighbors all try to walk over them and take advantage of their generous and kind nature. Oh sure, those pesky neighbors are slaughtered in short order and served up as their own "just desserts," but they're killed with no hard feelings... This family doesn't get mad, they just get full! Especially when the babysitter finds out she's the midnight snack!
