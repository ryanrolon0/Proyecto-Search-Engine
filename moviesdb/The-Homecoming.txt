The Homecoming

 Jordy Rembrandt is a big-city tough guy with an attitude and a history of bad decisions. When he's sent to a small-town high school to complete his senior year, he discovers "fitting in" takes on a whole new meaning. Like any of us faced with peer pressure requiring choices, Jordy yearns for acceptance . . . in spite of his rough exterior. He tries the ususal ways to get it - he plays football, goes to parties, dates a cheerleader. But it isn't until he's faced with the love of Christ that he begins to understand the meaning of true acceptance.
