RSTC

 Liz is a high school student who is nearly paralyzed with fear. It doesn't help any that the boy she likes has a little secret... he is a member of the Reserve Spy Training Corps, a training program for high school students who want to pursue a career as a spy. Her dealings with him force her to face her fears... and overcome them with the Word of God.
