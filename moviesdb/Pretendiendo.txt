Pretendiendo

 "When Amanda is humiliated by her lover and fired from her job, she decides to move to a new town and start over, but this time by making herself up as an ugly woman in an effort to be taken seriously. When she meets Marcelo, a cocky new coworker and quintessential 'player,' she decides to go one step further and test him by playing both her ugly persona and her real one (whom she now calls Helena) against him. But juggling a double life proves harder than she'd imagined, and when real feelings begin to develop between both Marcelo and Helena, as well as between Marcelo and Amanda, she finds her comedy of errors has turned into an odd and sexy love triangle."
