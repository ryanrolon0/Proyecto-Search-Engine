Trail of Whispers

 Slaves in eighteenth-century Virginia had no rights. They could not gather in large groups, and they could not travel freely. Slave marriages and families were not legally recognized. Yet slaves built and maintained strong communities capable of passing along information outside the hearing of their white masters. 'Trail of Whispers' is the story of how one African-American community hides a runaway slave using its close networks of 'whispered' news and information.
