 This short film documents the work of urban artist Stephan D., who set off to paint three whole communities in the small town  in the state of Bahia (Brazil). Setting up a gigantic site-specific. The walls of adobe and wattle and daub that dwellers live in, as well as a chapel and the cemetery graves, got new colors and shapes, which mix religious and contemporary pop culture with the local memory.
