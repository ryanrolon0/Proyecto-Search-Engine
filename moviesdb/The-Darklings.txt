The Darklings

 Three pre-teens, convinced that the man across the street has murdered his wife, pester their way into finding the truth... even if it means invading the man's home to look for clues. A bed-ridden teen believes he has witnessed the murder of a neighbor by another neighbor. He then recruits friends to attempt to prove the death when no body is found. Illness confines Chris Jackson to his room, where he's cared for by his grandmother. For the athletic teen, being bedridden is a fate worse than death. And he thinks he's witnessed a killing when, watching from his window, he sees what he believes is the fatal stabbing of the town's sweetest resident at the hand of a neighbor. With everyone doubting him, Chris sends his friends to gather clues and prove him right.
