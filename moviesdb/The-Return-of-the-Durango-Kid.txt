The Return of the Durango Kid

 It is Texas in 1875 and Kirby's gang continues to rob the stage. But now, the Durango Kid, robs Kirby's gang and returns the money to Mrs. Bancroft of the stage line. After that, he foils or robs the gang every time they try to make a heist. But Bill is really looking for evidence to clear the name of his dead father, the real Durango Kid. Bill Bladen returns to try and clear his father who was framed. He teams up with stage line owner Buckskin in her fight against Kirby and his gang. As the Durango Kid he foils Kirby's men in their robbery attempts and then as Bill gets a confession from Wagner that Kirby framed his father. When Kirby's henchmen hear the Durango Kid is working with Bill they flee leaving Bill to face Kirby in the showdown. Bill Blayden is on the trail to find the needed evidence to clear his father's name of a robbery frame-up. He is posing as a tenderfoot and he goes to work, by day, on a stage-line ran by 'Buckskin' Liz Blodgett, which is facing bankruptcy due to continuing holdups. At night he continues his investigation in the guise of a masked rider known as The Durango Kid.
