The Old Maid's Lament

 This is one of the "Saroni" series of pictures. Gilbert Saroni, the well-known female impersonator is here shown relating to the audience what troubles the old maids are heir to. Nothing is seen on the screen but the large head of an antiquated female, the expression of whom will cause the tears to flow in laughter.
