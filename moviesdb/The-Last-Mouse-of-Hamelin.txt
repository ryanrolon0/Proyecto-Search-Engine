The Last Mouse of Hamelin

 The Pied Piper has led all of the mice in Hamelin into the sea with the exception of one because he was tone-deaf. The cats are all competing with each other for the single, surviving mouse, aka the Last of the Mice. He outwits them all, woos and wins a cute girl-mouse from the next village, sets up housekeeping and starts a new line of Hamelin mice.
