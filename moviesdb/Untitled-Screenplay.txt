Untitled Screenplay

 Untitled Screenplay is a film that challenges VCE film makers by playing on the trivialities often associated with student film making. The film is designed not to make fun of, but to highlight these trivialities. Starting in an interrogation room we are introduced to the main character, two police officers are accusing him of a terrible crime, its then revealed that his crime is overly ambitious script writing. We then have a 'flashback/forward' to the main characters first idea being played out on screen, a horror. After his 'flash idea' we come back to the interrogation room, where we then see his next idea, a noir. This repeats one last time ending with an action sequence.
