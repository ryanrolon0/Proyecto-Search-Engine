Surferne kommer

 Anne and Niels-Peter live in a fishing village by the North Sea. They are going steady, but Anne thinks everything round there is a bit dull. Things liven up when a group of young German surfers camp on the beach. Anne and her girlfriend think they look smashing, but the local lads haven't much time for them. What business have these flashy German jerks got here? One night, when Anne and her girlfriend are dancing with the Germans at the local disco, a fight starts and Anne is forced to take sides.
