Small Things Forgotten

 In this short silent film, Jim, a recently divorced father, finds a mysterious fiddle at a bus stop and shares it with his daughter Maggie at the park. Maggie discovers a love for playing the instrument and is very disappointed when her father insists they return it to the owner. Meanwhile, Lindsay, the accomplished musician who left her fiddle at the bus stop, is devastated and searches everywhere for her most prized possession. A few weeks later when Jim meets Maggie again for their weekly visit, Maggie is delighted to find that he has bought her a fiddle of her own. Lindsay graciously provides fiddle lessons for Maggie and the young daughter discovers her love for music as well as a deepening relationship with her father.
