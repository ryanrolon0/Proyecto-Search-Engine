Prem Geet

 Akash and Shikha make an impressive creative team as they work together in a dance troupe, and a romantic relationship soon flourishes between them. But when it transpires that Shikha only has a few months to live, and she's pregnant, some dramatic scenes unravel as the movie travels nears its climax. Akash Bhardwaj is a poet and a singer, but he sings publicly and publishes his poems under the pen-name of Nishant as his dad does not approve of his hobby. During one of his presentations, he meets with a breath-takingly beautiful young woman, Shikha, and instantly falls in love with her. He finds out that she is a fan of his, and after a few misunderstandings, she too falls in love with him. While Akash's dad wants him to marry another young woman, Asha, Akash is adamant that he will marry Shikha only. Finally, his dad gives in, only to have Shikha refuse to marry Akash - for an undisclosed reason.
