Uncle Reuben at the Waldorf

 Uncle Reuben goes to a swell cafe and attempts to get something to eat. The waiter ignores him, and his hunger is only aggravated by the bounteous repast spread before other guests. Finally a waiter comes along with a tray full of eatables and Uncle Reuben gets revenge by tripping him and causing him to spill the contents of his tray over the more favored guests.
