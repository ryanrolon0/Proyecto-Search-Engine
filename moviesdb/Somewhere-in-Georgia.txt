Somewhere in Georgia

 Widely regarded as the greatest baseball player who ever lived, Ty Cobb made his only starring movie appearance in the low-budget six-reeler "Somewhere in Georgia". Based on a story by legendary sports columnist Grantland Rice, the film casts Cobb as "himself", a small-town Georgian bank clerk with a talent for baseball. When he's signed to play with the Detroit Tigers, Cobb is forced to leave his sweetheart (Elsie McLeod) behind, whereupon a crooked bank cashier sets his sights on the girl. Upon learning that Cobb has briefly returned home to play an exhibition game with his old team, the cashier arranges for Our Hero to be kidnapped. Breaking loose from his bonds, Cobb beats up each each and every one of his captors and shows up at the ballfield =just= in time to win the game for the home team.
