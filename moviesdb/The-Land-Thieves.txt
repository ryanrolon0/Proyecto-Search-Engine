The Land Thieves

 George Wilson is an emigrant seeking a new home. He stops at the town for provisions, and is warned by the rangers to look out for the land thieves. His daughter leaves the "prairie schooner," and her father introduces her to Jim Haden, the leader of the rangers. The ranger is very much impressed with the homesteader's daughter and she is pleased with the manly ranger. Their business transactions completed, the homesteaders continue their journey across the plains. The wagon is observed by the land thieves, who send a spy to find out where the "nester" intends to locate. At last, in a fertile valley, George Wilson starts to stake out his new home, and the spy returns to tell the other land thieves the place selected. The land thieves ride en masse to the homesteader's camp and warn him to leave the range before sundown. After their departure, the frightened wife and daughter urge the homesteader to leave, but he refuses to surrender his rights at the mandate of the outlaws. Securing his horse, he rides out to inspect the surrounding country. The leader of the land thieves, watching him from ambush, fires at him, killing him instantly. When her father does not return to camp, Margaret becomes uneasy, and mounting one of the horses, she goes out to look for him. She comes upon his body, and kneeling beside it gives way to her grief, when she hears the land thieves approaching.
