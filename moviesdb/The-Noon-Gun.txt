The Noon Gun

 In 1971, the experimental film maker Anthony Stern travelled to Afghanistan with his 16mm film camera. The footage was lost for almost 30 years. Recently rediscovered, it forms the basis of this impressionistic documentary, with an original soundtrack provided by the world fusion musicians 'Equa'.
