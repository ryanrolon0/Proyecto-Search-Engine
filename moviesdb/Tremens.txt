Tremens

 Tremens... A man who has lost everything, his son to a death, his wife to his drug addiction, has blocked out his dangerous past. One evening, the longest evening of his life, he takes an insurmountable amount of PCP and Acid to relieve the pain and the stress... but he receives a phone call... from his previous employers. They have his wife. They want what was to be delivered. He has 65 minutes until they kill her. The clock has started ticking and the race has begun. He must now find out what they want, remember his past, find his wife, and deliver the package in 65 minutes... all while high on PCP and Acid. As his hallucinations begin to kick in with every step he takes, the goal stands further away and the stakes continually rise...
