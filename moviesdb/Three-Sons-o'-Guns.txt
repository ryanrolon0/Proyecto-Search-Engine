Three Sons o' Guns

 Having being left a widow when her sons were young, Margaret Patters struggles to bring them up on the limited family finances. When they reach manhood, they cause her much travail because, each in his own way, is selfish and irresponsible; Charley, who can't keep a job because he would rather stay home on practice on his trombone; Eddie, a self-proclaimed sports promoter who has nothing to promote; and Kenneth, a struggling actor whose talents are mostly struggling. They all have to register for the pre-World War II draft, and each has all kinds of new ailments and excuses for not being drafted into the Army. Aunt Lottie has had enough, and she takes charge.
