SoftRock

 SoftRock, part 1 of a trilogy of short video works that the duo Actually Huizenga and Socrates Mitsios have colorfully referred to as 'Pop Rape', two words that have never been placed side by side, perhaps for justifiable reason. SoftRock is an exhibitionist display of naked, hyper-sexed bodies. At once glossy and vulgar, fastidiously disciplined and wildly chaotic, the filma are an exercise in the photogenic of sex. The video has all the predictable pleasures of porn and pop visual thrills intended for rapid and casual consumption. It is the past, processed and repackaged as the future. And the viewer is witness to a crime, an act of sexual violence that has been recorded and produced as a pop confection.
