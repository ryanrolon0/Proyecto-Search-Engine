Sonntag

 Psychiatric nurse Toni helps suicide-watch patient Maria to escape from the psychiatric clinic she is kept in. Maria's greatest wish is to experience normal life for one week Paris and then bid farewell to the world. Toni wants to accompany her and commit suicide with Maria on the following Sunday. A stirring, sweeping, tragicomic story that cuts deep.
