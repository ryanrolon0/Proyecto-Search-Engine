See Wall

 Georgetown, Guyana, a city built below sea level, is protected from the mighty Atlantic Ocean by a concrete barrier the locals call, the 'Sea Wall.' It is not only a wall, but also a landmark where the city's people gather to celebrate life. For five days, right before sunset, the award-winning filmmaker Brian Zahm filmed life along this wall to create a tribute to the people of Guyana. The play of sight and sound in this dynamic cinematic environment is one you will not forget.
