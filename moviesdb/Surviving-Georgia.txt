Surviving Georgia

 Surviving Georgia is a heart warming Romantic Comedy about family and finding your own identity in the world. About realising that sometimes to move forward, we have to let go of the past. Heidi and Rose must find love but in doing so must first reconcile with their feisty, vivacious and slightly alcoholic mother!
