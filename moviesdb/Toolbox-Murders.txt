Toolbox Murders

 Nell and her husband Steven are looking for a business, as well as a home, when they come across the Lusman Arms apartment block. They move in and begin renovating the building, in which a series of weird killings begin to take place. When she finally discovers the supernatural evil behind it all, she gets more than she bargained for! In Hollywood, the young teacher Nell and her husband, the resident Steven Barrows, move to an old building called Lusman Arms. Some sixty years ago, the place was glamorous, but presently is completely decadent. Many dwellers have disappeared along the years. While her husband is working in the hospital, the lonely Nell hears some weird noises and becomes afraid of the place. While jogging, she is introduced to (and becomes close to) her neighbor Julia Cunningham, and they schedule a hike together on the next day. Julia never shows up, and Nell looks for her in the building, finding a hiding block behind the wall, where an evil being, which was born from death, lives with many dead bodies.
