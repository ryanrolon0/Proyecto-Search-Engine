The Fall Before Paradise

 A psychiatric patient is haunted by dreams of abduction and abuse from the perspective of an abducted boy. The psychiatric patient stops taking his medication and the dreams and visions become even more disturbing. He will never have peace as long as the boy's little sister is in the company of the brutal abductors. The child's fate seems to rest in the hands of the outpatient girlfriend whose main objective is to bomb the phone company, convinced they are guilty of mass mind control. Together, two chemically imbalanced lovers struggle to see truth amidst the delusions of mental illness and stand alone in their attempt to rescue the abducted girl.
