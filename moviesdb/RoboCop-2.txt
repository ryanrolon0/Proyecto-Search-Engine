RoboCop 2

 After a successful deployment of the Robocop Law Enforcement unit, OCP sees its goal of urban pacification come closer and closer. But as this develops, a new narcotic known as "Nuke" invades the streets led by God-delirious leader Kane. As this menace grows, it may prove to be too much for Murphy to handle. OCP tries to replicate the success of the first unit, but ends up with failed prototypes with suicidal issues... until Dr. Faxx, a scientist straying away from OCP's path uses Kane as the new subject for the Robocop 2 project, a living God. Murphy the Cyborg Cop, is back on the streets. OCP, his manufacturer is unable to replicate the process to make more of him due to a series of suicides by their subjects. They decide to try a drug adict as a base for their next, stronger, bigger cyborg. Murphy meanwhile is rebuilt and they decide to add to his programming which has both funny and tragic results. Once again Detroit is ridden by a gang of drug dealers and Robocop is the only one who can do something about it. When Cain, the chief of the gang, is killed during his confrontation with Robocop, OCP (the company that runs the police) transforms him to Robocop 2, a new android much stronger than the first one. Now Murphy has to face him again, because Cain didn't forget who he was... A few months after RoboCop defeats Clarence Boddicker and Dick Jones. His job is far from done, and several issues make it so. The Detroit police is on strike, OCP is developing both a new robot officer to replace him and to begin construction of "Delta City" to replace Detroit. To make matters worse, there is a new group of criminals who made a new drug called "Nuke", led by a man only named "Cain". RoboCop and his partner Anne Lewis must get the Detroit police back on its feet, Defy OCP, and stop Cain. Plus, OCP may even have something for Cain as well.
