Under Rich Earth

 The Intag valley of Ecuador is a lush and fertile paradise inhabited by strong-willed and resourceful family farmers. Three generations of families have carved out a hard but good life in this remote frontier. While they don't earn much cash for their work, they own rich land, which is the greatest security for their children and for future generations. Under Rich Earth is a feature length documentary that follows family farmers in the Intag valley who resist what they consider to be the invasion of their land by foreign prospectors. Victor, Rosario, Robinson, Marcia and Carlos are among hundreds of people who join together to stop outsiders from transforming their beloved valley into what a Canadian mining company says will inevitably become a 'world class' copper mine. Facing the prospect of losing their precious land and forests, the farmers are ready to give up their lives. But is their conviction matched by the tenacity of those who want to undermine them?
