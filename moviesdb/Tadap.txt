 Mumbai Police believe Rahul killed himself and close the incident as a suicide. But when his advocate sister, Maya, comes forward to allege that he was killed by his wife, Dr. Ganga, they arrest the later, and charge her with killing her husband, while having an affair with her colleague Dr. Sagar. Ganga must now testify in Court to try and prove her innocence amidst overwhelming evidence that she was responsible for his death.
