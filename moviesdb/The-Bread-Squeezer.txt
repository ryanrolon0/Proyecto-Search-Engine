The Bread Squeezer

 When Andrew's loving parents die in a tragic Christmas tree accident, he is taken in by his well meaning, but extremely regimented, Aunt Gertrude Crab. Without the warmth of his mom and dad, young Andrew leads an unremarkable life full of chronic disappointments. Until one day, when everything goes horribly wrong and horribly right in the bread aisle of Pickles' Grocery Store.
