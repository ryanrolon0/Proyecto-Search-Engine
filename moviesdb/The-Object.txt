The Object

 After being hit in the head with a chunk of space debris, a man quickly becomes a threat to his small city, and must run from the secret police, avoiding the fate of all those who came in contact with the mysterious item. Adding to his confusion, he's already speaking a foreign language (in this case english), and surrounded with images of a stereotypical patriarchal dictator. Eventually the man is captured, interrogated, then apparently released into the desert. After wandering for what seems like days, he re-awakes in the dictator's castle. It's minutes before a popular revolutionary overthrow, and he's given back the mysterious object. The dictator is hauled away, but the man is left to become a new corrupt despot.
