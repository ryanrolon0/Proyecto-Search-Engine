Postcard to Owen Sound

 Much to the chagrin of Owen Sound residents, international attention is drawn to a hometown waitress who was 'laid off' from her job after shaving her head during a cancer fund raising campaign. Met with often evasive, laconic, if not tight lipped resistance from the locals, the filmmaker is forced to assess the insular nature of this small town. Interviews span from the mayor of Owen Sound to the restaurant owner who dismissed the waitress in question. Ultimately, this film explores community protectionism and mechanisms of small town solidarity under outside scrutiny.
