The Crazy Artist and the Pictures That Came to Life

 A demented looking, half starved artist appears and paints on the canvas a picture of himself. Of a sudden the picture comes to life, jumps down from the canvas and runs out of the studio. The artist then begins daubing the canvas promiscuously with paint, making lines that apparently have no character in them whatever. Suddenly jumping into the air and flourishing his hands about, he causes the confused looking lines to turn into a landscape with an old mill in the background. The artist then jumps backwards through the canvas, apparently ripping it to pieces. He finally steps out behind the picture and leaves the landscape perfectly intact.
