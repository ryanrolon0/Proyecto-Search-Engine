The Red Menace

 A disillusioned, bitter ex-GI gets involved with the Communist party, and winds up falling in love with one of his "instructors." At first true believers, they realize their mistake when they witness Party leaders murder a member who questions the party's principles. They try to leave the party, but are marked for murder and hunted by the party's assassins.
