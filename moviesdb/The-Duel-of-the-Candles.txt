The Duel of the Candles

 A poor prospector and a prosperous ranch man, who in reality is a horse thief, are in love with the widow's daughter. The girl gives her heart to the poor man much to the disfavor of her mother. When news of her betrothal reaches the horse thief's ears he plans to get even. He captures the prospector at work and forges a letter in the prospector's handwriting to the girl's mother, saying that he is going East to marry a former sweetheart. Believing it true, the girl is soon persuaded to marry the rich ranch man. The poor man is soon liberated from the horse thief's camp, where he was imprisoned and goes immediately to the ranch man's unhappy wife. She begs him to take her away, but he will not do it, as she is not his legally wedded wife. Just then the horse thief comes in. The poor prospector gives him a chance for his life. He places two candles on the table, lights both and bids the wife to leave the room. Who's ever candle burns out first must die by his own hands.
