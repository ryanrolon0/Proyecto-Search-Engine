The Delhi Camp Railway

 The cars used on this railroad are very small and the seats used in them are settees, similar to those used in parks. The roof and one side of each car is covered with canvas to keep out the burning rays of the sun. There are no steps on the cars, the floors of them being on a level with the station platform. A very novel railway scene. This railroad was specially constructed for visitors to the Delhi Durbar.
