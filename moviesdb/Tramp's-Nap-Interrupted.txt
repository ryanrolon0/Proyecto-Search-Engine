Tramp's Nap Interrupted

 Two tramps meet on the railroad, and after shaking hands one departs, leaving the other in the center of the track, who seats himself on one of the ties and proceeds to eat his mid-day luncheon, occasionally taking a drink from his black bottle. He falls asleep and is struck by a fast express running at the rate of 50 miles an hour, and is literally ground to pieces. The train crew return to gather up his remains on a board, and attempt to carry him away when he returns to life and pulling a bottle from his pocket, takes a long draught, much to the amusement of the men carrying him.
