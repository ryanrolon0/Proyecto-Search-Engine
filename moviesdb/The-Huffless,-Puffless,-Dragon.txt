The Huffless, Puffless, Dragon

 While all the other dragons are puffing away, one dragon refuses to smoke. They all think he's totally square and a number of them challenge him to fights, races, and arm-wrestling contests. As he defeats them all with his clean lungs and nicotine-free body, they begin to think that maybe he's the cool one after all.
