The Bro Code

 For centuries men have attempted to follow this code with no universal understanding of what such an arrangement meant If I'm invited to a Bro's wedding, do I really have to bring a gift? Can I sleep with a Bro's sister or mother or both? Now, for the first time, we have recorded the rules of social decorum that Bros have practiced since the dawn of man...if not before. The Bro Code previously existed only as an oral tradition, then in a compiled written version, so it was only fitting that we re-enacted the rules, violations and amendments of the Bro Code for clarification.
