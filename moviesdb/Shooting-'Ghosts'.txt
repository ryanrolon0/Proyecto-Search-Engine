Shooting 'Ghosts'

 Having finished his film degree at university, Marc Hoeferlin tracks down documentary film-maker Nick Broomfield at a film festival with the hope of getting to work with him on his next film, 'Ghosts'. 6 weeks later he gets a call and is asked to shoot the making-of 'Ghosts', a feature film about illegal Chinese immigrants in the UK, their standard of living, and their tragic death at Morecambe Bay in February 2004. Originally planned as a 20 minute featurette, 'Shooting Ghosts' developed into a film of its own, chronicling Broomfield's unorthodox style of making 'Ghosts' and looks into the issues raised in the film by following him through his initial research trips, casting, and filming. The cast of 'Ghosts' are all non-actors and real life Chinese immigrants, from the lead actress who had been smuggled to the UK and had to send her son back home to China, to the lead actor thinking he is a better director than Nick.
