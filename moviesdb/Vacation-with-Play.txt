Vacation with Play

 Popeye and Olive are on vacation at Lake Narrowhead. Olive wants to take part in athletic activities, while Popeye just wants to rest (particularly since he had to substitute for one wheel of their sad excuse of a car). Olive goes off for athletic instruction while Popeye sleeps until he sees that the instructor is Bluto, and he's taking a personal interest in Olive.
