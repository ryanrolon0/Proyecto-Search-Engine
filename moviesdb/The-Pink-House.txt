The Pink House

 The Pink House is a fast-paced, youthful comedy that has been called a sweeter, more intellectual Animal House. Five men and women race against time (and sometimes their own knack for self-sabotage) to save the consummate Southern, rowdy group house from the academic upper crust and a vindictive sorority. Our hero, Murray, must finish his long overdue thesis on "The Ten Archetypes of Americans in their Twenties" as the clock ticks ever louder. Challenges of love, aptitude, and character are presented and won with fun and intensity while our rambunctious housemates grow emotionally, spiritually, and perhaps a bit more tipsy.
