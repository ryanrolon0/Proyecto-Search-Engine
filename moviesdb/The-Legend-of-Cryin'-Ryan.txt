The Legend of Cryin' Ryan

 A young girl named Kris gets caught playing hide and go seek in the cemetery by Mr. Collins, the superstitious caretaker. While running from Mr. Collins, she accidentally trips and knocks over the tombstone of the legendary town bully, Cryin' Ryan Greene. Mr Collins tells Kris that by knocking over Ryan's tombstone she has set the spirit free and must now find it and put it back or suffer the same fate as the murdered boy did over forty years ago.
