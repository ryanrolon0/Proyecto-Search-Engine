So, the 'R' Lost Gods

 A long time ago existed the 'R' simple shape. They lived in peace with their god the 'Snake'.One day, a 'Monster' appears in the world and harasses the 'R'. The 'R's feel anger and sorrow, so they ask their god the 'Snake' for power. With this power, they can have their revenge against the 'Monster' and take his body as a trophy. After wards, when the 'Snake' comes to the 'R's world, it sees that the 'R's have changed form to resemble the 'Monster'. They demand more power from the 'Snake' and cling to its' breasts, which rip from the god's body. Thus, the 'R's lose their god.
