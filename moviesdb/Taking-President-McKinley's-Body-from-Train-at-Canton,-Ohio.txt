Taking President McKinley's Body from Train at Canton, Ohio

 Here, as in the other pictures, we secured a most advantageous location, and we present a life size view of the casket containing the body of President McKinley as it is slowly and carefully taken from the window of the car which bore it from the Capitol to Canton. The casket is placed upon the shoulders of ten stalwart sailors and soldiers and borne to the waiting hearse, followed by President Roosevelt and Cabinet.
