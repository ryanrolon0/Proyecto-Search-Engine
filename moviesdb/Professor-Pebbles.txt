Professor Pebbles

 Professor Pebbles is 500 years old today. Over the years he hasn't really proven to be the most successful devil. In fact most of those who know him - his students, colleagues and even his father - think that he's a failure and should give up ever amounting to anything. Spurred on by his birthday he goes out to prove himself as a decent devil, only for things to backfire.
