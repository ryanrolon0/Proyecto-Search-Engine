Presit svuj sen

 An Agnes Dimun's graduation documentary film capturing Jan Svankmajer during the making of his new film Surviving Life. A mosaic pieced together from fragments of film shooting plunges the viewer into the depths of the maestro's alchemy of creation, incessantly oscillating between dream and reality.
