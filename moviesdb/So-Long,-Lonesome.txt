So Long, Lonesome

 In his last seconds of consciousness, a dying man experiences a vivid fever dream about his life. The story of his life focuses on the intense relationship he shared with the last woman he loved, who herself was killed in a car accident only six months prior. We experience his life through a variety of vignettes, some real and some imagined, as well as an encounter with the woman in what may possibly be more than just a hallucination... Ryan, a twenty-something Angelino, is in mourning after losing the love of his life, a vivacious young woman named Angie, to a drunk driving accident six months prior. To help cope with the pain, he slides into alcohol, cigarettes, and an ever-increasing intake of sleeping pills. One night, he experiences a vivid fever dream, presented as a series of vignettes that show various moments from their relationship- but is all this just a sleeping-state hallucination, or is it something different altogether?
