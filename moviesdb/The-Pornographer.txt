The Pornographer

 A young, frustrated man (Michael DeGood) after indulging in prostitutes, makes some home pornography and decides to take it to an adult video producer (Craig Wasson). Promising fame, the young man is encouraged to go find ingenues to put in his films. This leads him to an innocent (Katheryn Cain), fresh off the bus in LA with actress aspirations. Ultimately the two are led into their own total humiliation and destruction.
