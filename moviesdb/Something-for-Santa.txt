Something for Santa

 Every year Santa Claus comes to town bearing gifts for children all over the world providing they leave him a little something in return... a cup of blood. A skeptical young boy, Billy Bester, refuses to comply each year as he is convinced that St. Nick is not the kind, generous man the world believes him to be. Santa travels at night, wears red, needs to blood of youth, and "Know what you get when you take the letter "n" out of Santa and put it at the end?" Something's not right about all this. Deck the halls with cloves of garlic cause Santa Claus is coming to town...and he's thirsty.
