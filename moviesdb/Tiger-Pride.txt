Tiger Pride

 It all started with the passion of a few hearty New Englanders, the ingenuity of a socialite, and the commitment of a community. In its eight decades of hockey, the Colorado College Tigers have both celebrated national championships and teetered on the edge of extinction. The way back to national prominence has been equally dramatic. Unexpected victories, bitter defeats, gold pans and much more. Narrated by Hall of Fame announcer Mike "Doc" Emrick, this film will take you through eight decades of triumph and despair. The DVD includes the feature-length documentary as well as bonus features. It's an unforgettable journey, and the perfect holiday stocking stuffer for the hockey fan in your life.
