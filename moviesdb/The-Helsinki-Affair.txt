The Helsinki Affair

 A fumbled attempt to pick up an attractive woman leads a shy and nervous man into case of mistaken identity. Finding there is money at stake he takes an uncharacteristically bold step and tries to turn the situation to his advantage. Finding he has now entered into a binding contract to kill on behalf of the home office, he approaches his would be victim with a proposition.
