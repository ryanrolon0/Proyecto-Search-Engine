Santa Claus Filling Stockings

 "This is the second of the Santa Claus pictures. Old Nick comes down the chimney with his pack of toys on his back, and fills up each stocking to the utmost. When he has finished his work he goes back up the chimney again. Outside through the window, the snow is seen falling and the whole effect is very realistic."
