The Country Club

 Once a prestigious country club overlooking Port-au-Prince and the Caribbean Sea, the only golf course in Haiti has become an impromptu home to tens of thousands living beneath tarps due to a devastating earthquake. Out of the estimated half-million left homeless, this short documentary follows one 12-year old boy struggling to find hope despite heavy rains, instability, and a future unknown.
