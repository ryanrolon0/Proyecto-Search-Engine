Soulcalibur III

 After Siegfried finally frees himself from the grasp of Nightmare, he seals the power of Soul Edge by piercing its eye with Soul Calibur and journeys to find a way to keep the cursed blade out of the hands of those that would abuse it. However, a mysterious new figure known as Zasalamel has recently become interested in the swords for his own purposes. After breathing new life into Nightmare, Zasalamel works to return power to Soul Edge in order to break the seal. Meanwhile, other warriors from the past begin their search anew. Their common goal is Soul Edge; a weapon some see as a prize, others see as salvation, and those that know its true identity as a blade of pure evil.
