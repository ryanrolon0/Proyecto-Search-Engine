The Strange Case of Clara Deane

 A young dress designer marries an insurance agent. They soon have a daughter, but what the wife doesn't know is that her husband is actually a criminal, who soon involves her--unwittingly--in a robbery. Sentenced to prison, she gives up her baby for adoption. When she is released 15 years later, she sets out to find her long-lost daughter. A police inspector gets involved in her search and, for reasons of his own, tries to dissuade her from finding her child.
