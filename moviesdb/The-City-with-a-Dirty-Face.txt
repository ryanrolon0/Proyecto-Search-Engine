The City with a Dirty Face

 Karosta is a portrait of the demise and fall of the Soviet Empire as seen through the eyes of the people who endured it. Isolated from society both physically and mentally, the people of Karosta have lived through times of lawlessness and chaos, forging their own lives amongst the madness. With dead bodies turning up on a regular basis, and the threat of violence ever looming, it would be hard to believe that anyone would choose to live there. However, a small group of artists, who have been inspired by these unique surroundings have set up an arts institute that aims to help the people of Karosta, whilst using their experiences there as inspiration. Karosta is a film which shows how human spirit can overcome adversity and unite a whole community.
