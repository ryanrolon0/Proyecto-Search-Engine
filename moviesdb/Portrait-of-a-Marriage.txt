Portrait of a Marriage

 A silent surreal and abstract short drama that plays homage to Ingmar Bergman. The film is about a married couple, Liv and Erland. Liv is emotionally devastated and repressed and Erland attempts to reach out to her, but the pain and damage he has caused is too severe to heal their relationship.
