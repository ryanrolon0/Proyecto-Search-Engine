Shining On

 Caprianne Langston is a paranormal research investigator seeking to unravel the mystery behind a legendary spirit exorcism. Her search takes on a more poignant and personal meaning after she is diagnosed with a terminal disease. Caprianne's desire for answers is inspired by the need to find the ever-elusive, tangible proof of life beyond our physical existence. It is a question of instilling hope, strengthening faith, and of knowing that although one day we will cease to exist in this world, somewhere, somehow, another great journey awaits us; and we will all shine on.
