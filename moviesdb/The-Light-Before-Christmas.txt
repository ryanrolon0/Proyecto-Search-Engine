The Light Before Christmas

 After losing their way on a cold, blustery Christmas eve, two children, Katie and Makean are rescued by their friend, the Candleman, an old sage who imparts wisdom, hot chocolate, and stories. Opening a weathered book, he begins reading the classic tale, The Night Before Christmas. Magically, Katie and Makean become characters in the poem where they learn the light of Christmas comes from the giver of all good gifts.
