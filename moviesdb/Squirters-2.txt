Squirters 2

 What is the G-spot? What are the three main avenues for a woman to achieve orgasm? Is there anything a woman can do to enhance her ability to achieve orgasm through intercourse? These topics and more are explored by Seymore Butts with live demonstrations from Alisha Klass, Montana Gunn, and Tina Cherry. In a scheduling snafu, Herschel Savage drops by a day early for a lunch date with Seymore, and stays to contribute his expertise. Parts of scenes from some of Seymore's earlier movies appear in a montage segment to illustrate the practical application of the techniques demonstrated. And, for those having trouble with the exercises described, this instructional video closes with a sales pitch for an appliance that takes most of the work out of the equation.
