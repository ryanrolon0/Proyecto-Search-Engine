The Fanglys

 In the small rustic town of Layton, Texas, a legend exists. A legend that speaks of a mysterious, soul-stealing witch, known as Fanglady, that resides deep within the haunted woods along Storm Creek Road. A small abandoned road that is no longer traveled except by those brave enough to tempt their fate in search of the evil witch. So when a group of friends head out in search of some Halloween fun, they not only find out that the legend is real, but deadly, as they also discover more secrets to this terrifying experience in horror. As each hour passes, they begin a more desperate attempt to survive the night, escape the legend, and get out of the woods without losing their lives or their souls!
