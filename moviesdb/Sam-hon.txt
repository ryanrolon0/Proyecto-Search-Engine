Sam hon

 Sammi and her husband Chan find themselves resurrecting their nearly failed marriage after Sammi suffers a severe injury during a robbery. Though the injury gives Sammi and Chan another chance at love, it also puts her in great danger. After she heals from the incident, Sammi begins to have premonitions of murders, an event which Chan, a police officer, uses to further a murder investigation, but which also places them at risk from the murderer.
