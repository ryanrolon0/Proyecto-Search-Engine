The Necromancer

 Scene is in a typical wizard's cave. A modern young man applies for a wife. The wizard thereupon materializes several females, one after the other, with a wave of his wand. They are unsatisfactory and are caused to disappear in a mysterious manner. An ideal girl is then shown, but she changes into so many varying shapes that the young man is sorely perplexed. She finally maintains her normal shape, however, and the young man accepts her as his bride.
