Rock to Rock

 Kid Coma [the band] is the musical culmination of a talented and eclectic crew blues musician and a young guitar prodigy. Rock to Rock [the doc] is a rare and intimate slice of their existence as they prepare to release their new CD. It is a story of art, science, and people, told through lenses both analytical and creative.
