The True Adventures of the Real Beverly Hillbillies

 Filmmaker and native Virginian Dub Cornett had a simple idea television version of the old Beverly Hillbillies show. Take a hillbilly family and transplant them to the Babylon of pop culture - Hollywood, California. Dub figured his people - the hillbillies - would come off looking pretty savvy. He found the perfect family, the Griffeys, not far from his own hometown. Dub sold the series to CBS, but before the pilot was even shot, the show was being denounced on the floor of the US Senate as politically incorrect and offensive to mountain people. Next thing he knew, the show was canceled before it had even been made. The Griffeys (all 7 of them) ended up with nothing. The True Adventures of the Real Beverly Hillbillies picks up where that story leaves off, as Dub takes the Griffeys on a cross-country trip in a 40-foot motor home all the way to Hollywood. It's a documentary about getting to know a family who may be outside the mainstream and well off the grid, but who have a great sense of who they are in the world and how to live life. It's a documentary about balancing of scales, setting things right and keeping promises. It's about seeing America through new eyes as we travel along with "the family Congress kept off TV."
