Three Thug Mice

 The Three Thug Mice are criminal cartoon scoundrels; anti-heroes straight from the gutter. This independent, uncensored animated short film spans a year in the life of the mice, following the hysterical antics and brutal power plays of our verminous trio while they evade the porcine police, the cockroach cocaine cartel and a gaggle of other unsavory characters. The story charts the mice's rise from the sewer to the gutter. It begins when the Three Thug Mice whack the biggest drug dealer on the block, the Hip Hop Hippo. When the drug kingpin Jorge Cucaracha finds out, he hires them as his street level distributors. This sparks an action packed, whirlwind journey of gangster antics, double-dealing and cold-blooded murder. It's a jungle out there but hey; a mouse has to do what a mouse has to do.
