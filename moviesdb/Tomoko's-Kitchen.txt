Tomoko's Kitchen

 A divorced businessman, a neurotic actress, a pair of arguing lovebirds, a suicidal celebrity, and a blocked writer live in the same building - but have never met. When the building's entrance security doors jam shut one workday morning, they learn the only other exit is through the apartment of English-challenged fellow resident Tomoko Meadows, who's in the midst of making cinnamon rolls. Although these disparate neighbors are desperate to barge in and dash out, when Tomoko misunderstands "jam" and invites them to enjoy the oven-fresh rolls, they discover how little their personal dramas mean... and how love and friendship are closer than they imagined.
