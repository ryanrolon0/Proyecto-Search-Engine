The Stray

 Micky and Linda find love, happiness, violence and death, again and again, in their reoccurring cycle of insanity and reincarnate evil set in the quiet charm of a century-old Craftsman home in the hills North of Los Angeles. Video captured entirely on location where it happened, in that house. They have been through this before, their past lives played out to the same violent end as the one before, and the one before that. Only Micky retains any memory of the past and suffers the insanity of those memories in psychotic confusion and incarceration. Dare to adventure with them and their fight to survive as they explore the extremes and passions of life and death and life again. If only the dead would stay that way.
