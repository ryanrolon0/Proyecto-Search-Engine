The Crookedest Railroad Yard in the World

 "This unique title is claimed for the yard of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, at Denham Junction, and the picture was evidently taken from the cow-catcher of a locomotive which darts around the curves, and takes unexpected switches in the most surprising fashion. This picture is particularly interesting as illustrating the many modern safe-guards which are used to protect the lives of travelers on American railroads."
