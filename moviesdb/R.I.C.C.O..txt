R.I.C.C.O.

 A secret task force (called Ricco) is formed to unburden the city of crime using a high tech computer system. This task force is dethroned by a arcane member and becomes an above-the-law cartel monoplolizing all criminal activity. A lawyer, who witnesses the murder of a federal informant by the hired guns of Ricco is caught in the middle as he attempts to rescue a beautiful young woman. The two of them must utilize cunning tactics to elude the members of Ricco and expose them to the world before they take them out.
