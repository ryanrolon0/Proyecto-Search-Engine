Steam, Sanctity and Song

 Sir Michael REDGRAVE & Joan GREENWOOD narrate a social history of Victorian Britain as reflected in the Music Hall songs of the time performed by James BOOTH, Eira HEATH, David KERNAN, Patsy ROWLANDS & Sir Michael REDGRAVE. Much of the program is stills from the song sheets of the time & animation based on contemporary prints cut with brief shots of narration to camera & songs sung in a Music Hall setting.
