Smoke, Sniff, Swallow

 A journey through underground urban Philadelphia where cameras are not allowed to go (until today). The film follows Poze, a Philly rapper as he leads viewers to see the Philadelphia that the public was not meant to see - inclusive of Larry Gold's marijuana-niffed studio (recording home of stars Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, Double Up).
