Vive Elle

 The life of Agathe (25) is dominated by the fear of abandonment. This fear has paradoxically made her break off her relationship with Olivier but he continues to dominate her life in many ways. Agathe is searching for her seductive and feminine side which she has not yet found. Three women in her surroundings do have that seductive side. They are her niece Eve, her girlfriend Alexandra and her imaginary idol Vivelle. Her admiration for the qualities of these women grows into an obsession. Her inability to change anything in her situation drives her towards insanity and self-destruction.
