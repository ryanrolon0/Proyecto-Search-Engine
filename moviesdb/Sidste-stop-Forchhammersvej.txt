Sidste stop Forchhammersvej

 Where do you go after a long life as a drug addict - when you are too old and weak to survive in the street? The first old people's home for drug addicts has been established on Forchhammersvej in Copenhagen. Here we meet the residents who receive warm, dignified care of their worn-out bodies and souls.
