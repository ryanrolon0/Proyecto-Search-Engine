Redemption Road

 Uncared for by the community, Rick, recently mad, is looking for somewhere warm to commit suicide. Instead he finds George, a downtrodden doormat of a man, recently separated. In turn they stumble upon the embittered, man-mountain that is Joe, recently bereaved. One game of pool and several drinks later these three disparate men are thrown together on a journey no-one wants to take, to a destination no-one believes exists, chased by a man no-one should meet. Then there's the Hippies, George's ex-wife, a robbery, drugs, amputation, muggings, Brownies, the Police, explosions and this really, really gorgeous girl.
