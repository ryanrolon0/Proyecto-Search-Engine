Su mandala

 The idea at the base of the project is to let cohabit two apparently opposite worlds unstructured serial aesthetic very close to the mysticism of the Tibetan mandalas and the digital fractal decomposition of the space. The research tents to re create a world of abstract images that nevertheless shelter the elements of recognizability of the singers. They are portrayed almost like glass icons of an Escher like cathedral window, or through a mirror-like pop lens. The result is a moment of absolute suspension and classic-like estrangement. The digital attitude is, yes, used to transform the shape and the body of the singers but with an extreme cure in the attempt of translating and respecting that ancient ancestral feeling that this singing recalls.
