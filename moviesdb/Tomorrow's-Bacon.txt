Tomorrow's Bacon

 A bickering couple in the last stages of a marriage gone sour make life uneasy for a small town waitress when they pull up to her diner on a cold winter night just before closing time. She tries to keep things cool when the couple, obviously from out of town and in midst of more than just a squabble, decide to come in for coffee, tea and directions to the Interstate.
