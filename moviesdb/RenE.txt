RenE

 This raw authentic documentary film tells the story of RenE whose life was being captured on camera since he was seventeen. The camera followed his hopeless journey between prison and brief periods outside the prison walls. In 2008 the film comes to an end, leaving the now 37-year-old RenE as a sick man who still gets in trouble with the law and who is also the author of two published books.
