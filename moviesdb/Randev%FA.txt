Randevú

 A terminally ill young woman IrEn is saying good-bye to her child Rózsika. Fifty years later the then orphaned child is a homeless old woman who inherited her mother's pneumoconiosis. Throughout her time roaming around in the city Rózsika meets a taciturn woman, who moves in a strange way. They became close friends. Neither of them knows but the viewers soon find out that we are witnessing the reunion of mother and daughter. From this point the two women's lives are entwined. Through their adventures the significantly different worlds and characters living in Hungary in the third millennium are juxtaposed. When it turns out that Rózsika, the old and ill homeless woman, has only days to live, IrEn mobilises her hidden energies and like in a modern tale she saves her daughter from suffering.
