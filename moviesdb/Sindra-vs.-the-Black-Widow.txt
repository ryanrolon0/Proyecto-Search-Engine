Sindra vs. the Black Widow

 When Mindy learns that a doctor has been kidnapped by thugs intent on using a revolutionary formula for nefarious deeds, she springs into action as the superheroine Sindra. She is overwhelmed by the kidnapping gang and forced to watch in bound and gagged silence while the doctor is brainwashed and convinced she is actually a super-villain - The Black Widow . Once this is accomplished, the gang sets about forcing the inexperienced superheroine to become the Black Widow's reluctant slave. In a vignette, superheroine Crimson Angel is captured, bound, gagged and fondled by a gang of thugs.
