The Man from the City He Then Destroyed

 Freddy is an intelligent, educated and eloquent man, but a deeply embittered one as well. He is reckless, and at times borderline sadistic but has a strange and intriguing, intense presence. He is driven by bleakness and the question of existence; the existence of humanity and conformity. Freddy has a gritty, brutal approach to life and makes all around him feel uncomfortable. He takes pity on the waitress, who doesn't like having him around but knows of his good qualities through her observations. Freddy is a man trying to discover the idea of existence while challenging the idea of why humanity is ceased to be. He is not a good man, but not a bad one either.
