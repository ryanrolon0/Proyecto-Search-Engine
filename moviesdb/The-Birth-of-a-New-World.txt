The Birth of a New World

 In a remote medical facility, men and women from different racial and ethnic backgrounds are gather together. They are required to act as participants in a program that is designed to develop a New World that is free from racial differences. The participants are put in pairs, one male and one female, are are placed in procreation rooms where they are given time and space to conceive one child. The replication of the process will result in a singular culture that will share one global identity - free from racism and prejudice. Finally, everyone will be the same. But what happens when individuals prefer to maintain their cultural, racial, and ethnic identities?
