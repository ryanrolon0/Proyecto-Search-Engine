Two Girls

 Edward Holbrook has in his employ two stenographers, Estelle Vanderhouse and Mary Adams. Estelle, who is superficially attractive, is his favorite, and she impresses him to so great an extent that he decides to propose to her. Her brutal treatment, however, of a little newsboy, causes him to be less precipitate in his intentions, and he determines to investigate a little before declaring his love. He disguises himself as an old beggar and calls early in the morning at Estelle's house and asks for something to eat. Her mother is washing and the whole atmosphere in the house indicates a very slovenly household and a hard-working mother, who is a slave to her daughter's whims and bad temper. The old lady gives him food as Estelle enters, roughly takes the food from him and puts him out into the street. He next goes to the home of Mary and finds conditions entirely different. Her mother is an invalid and in her daughter's one loving care. He is asked in and given refreshment and treated as though he was an invited guest. When about to depart he is given an overcoat to tale the place of the ragged on he is wearing, a coat that belonged to the widow's dead son. Edward, thankful that he has learned in time what Estelle's true character is, and what true, sweet nature Mary possesses, naturally is drawn towards the other girl. He proposes to Mary and is accepted. Estelle finds a communication from Edward, in which he tells her that her services will be no longer required, and makes it plain to her that he was the beggar whom she so cruelly turned away.
