Ultimate Avengers

 In 1945, Captain America, U.S. soldier created with a Super-Soldier Serum, is fighting the Nazis during World War II, and after averting a nuclear disaster, he falls into the icy waters of the North Atlantic, and frozen in suspended animation, only to be revived in the twenty-first century by the American military, who are hoping that they can recreate the serum in Captain America's blood in order to create more super-soldiers. But now, with the world facing the very same evil, Captain America must rise again as our last hope of survival, and lead a strong-willed team of today's superheroes. Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America, returns to the world after being frozen in ice for 60 years. It's a different world. A world that needs heroes. With Iron Man, Thor, Wasp, Giant Man, and others, he forms a team to preserve justice in our chaotic times. Together they are The Avengers.
