The Bamboo Prison

 A prisoner of war film with as much realism as a "Sgt. Fury" comic book and would look like one if it had been in color. Robert Francis is a supposedly turn-coat American P.O.W in a North Korean camp holding United Nations prisoners, but is actually there as an American intelligence officer trying to get a list of the atrocities committed there before the treaty is signed at Panmunjom. The biggest atrocity is a script that makes the Koreans an Asian sterotype not seen since Warner Oland was hanging around Chinatowns in silent movies. Anyway, because of his "collabaration", Francis is given the run of the camp and he uses that to play footsie with Dianne Foster, the Russian wife of an American traitor. Meanwhile, good old E.G. Marshall is a Communist posing as a priest so he can gather information from the prisoners. Since the three main characters (and a couple of others) aren't what they appear to be things get confusing among the players and, possibly, an audience member or two who wandered in during the second reel.
