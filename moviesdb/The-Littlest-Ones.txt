The Littlest Ones

 This is a 'call to action' film that addresses the issues of pet overpopulation, unnecessary euthanasia, the economic woes and its effects on animal shelters, kill shelters, puppy mills, animal abuse and so much more. The filmmakers discuss what the present problems are in today's society, and supply the shocking truths about animals in shelters. The viewer will venture through two separate animal shelters and programs too see what some folks are doing to solve these problems. We visit with the Lawrence Humane Society as they work tirelessly to keep great pets in good homes. Midge Grinstead (Director of the Lawrence Humane Society) discusses her struggles with funding, owner turn ins, adoption problems and her own emotional attachment to abused and mistreated dogs. At the same time we visit with the Safe Harbor Prison Dogs Program as they rescue dogs from a puppy mill and take them to a local prison where inmates care for and rehabilitate dogs for adoption. Brett Peterson (Head of Safe Harbor Prison Dogs) also discusses his struggles with many of the same issues. However, the film doesn't focus on the negative aspects of the problems. Instead, the film celebrates the actions of those who work tirelessly to save and care for these amazing animals. The film discusses the joy of pet adoptions, and tells the story of dog that was lucky enough to have not only a safe home, but also has become a local celebrity. The film shows a spirit and a kind of hope, for these lovable animals, that one day someone will let them share their lives with them. Changing lives one dog at a time.
