The Richard Pryor Special?

 'Richard Pryor' (qv) wanders around the NBC Studio and encounters a nutty religious woman, a pushy fan from a tour group, a street peddler, a shoeshine man, two young boys who know their Black history, and a group of radical staff writers. Meanwhile, the Reverend James L. White wants his viewers' money in order to relieve them of all that paper. 'Gladys Knight' (qv) and the Pips appear without Gladys Knight. Idi Amin Dada rebuts a recent NBC editorial. In a segment adapted from 'Langston Hughes' (qv), sexy women with various shades of dark skin proclaim that Black is beautiful. Willie stumbles into a bar and stumbles back out before coming home to his wife, who delivers a soliloquy written by 'Maya Angelou' (qv).
