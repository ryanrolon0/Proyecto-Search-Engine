 A young thief on the run meets a blind stranger in the woods. The stranger, a fellow thief from a rival guild, appears to be alone, deep in the heart of the forest. The two are miles from the city that makes them enemies. When his elder rival makes a spur-of-the-moment business proposal, the young man must then decide trap waiting to be sprung?
