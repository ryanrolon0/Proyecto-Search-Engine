The Bewildered Astronomer

 Another pretty illusion is the film of the Bewildered Astronomer. The old man is truly bewildered when everything that he handles disappears, no one knows where. The picture is full of life and action and will amuse any audience. It keeps the audience guessing all the time, where the objects go when they leave the hands of the Astronomer.
