That I May Live

 Crooks use a man's (Kent) safe-cracking skills then involve him in more crime after he spends three years in jail. He falls in love with a waitress (Hudson) and they go to work for a traveling salesman (Bromberg). Dick Mannion serves three years in prison for using his safe-cracking skills, and comes out determined to go straight. But the gang forces him to get involved again. He falls in love with a waitress, Irene Howard, and they take jobs with a traveling merchant, "Tex" Shapiro, to get away from the gang and the law. However, both catch up to them.
