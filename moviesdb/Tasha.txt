Tasha

 Tasha is a magical love story between a 14 year old boy from the city and a 14 year old girl from a small town. It's about those very first pangs of love where a simple kiss on the lips can amount to a taste and touch of heaven. And it's about how far a fragile insecure teenage boy is willing to go just to be accepted by the 'cool' kids, even rejecting the one true thing in his life... Tasha. Fragile, insecure DEAN (14) wants more than anything to be accepted by the 'cool' kids. But he's just not cool; he gets teased and bullied and he just can't get himself invited to the cool kids' parties where he can only imagine what happens. But then, on holiday at a magical farmhouse, he meets TASHA (14), an innocent girl from a small town; and the two fall in love. Back home in the city, with his newfound confidence, DEAN finally gets invited into the cool group. He even gets to make out with one of the cool girls. When TASHA and her family visit, DEAN now thinks he's too cool for the small-town TASHA; he blatantly ignores her at first, and even comes onto her older sister, then he forces himself onto TASHA, the only way he knows how, the 'cool' way. But the innocent TASHA rejects him, storming out of his room, forcing DEAN to have to really think about his actions. Back at school, suffering over what he knows he's lost forever, DEAN finally stands up to the cool kids, standing on his own two feet for the first time, and learning that the real 'cool' is within.
