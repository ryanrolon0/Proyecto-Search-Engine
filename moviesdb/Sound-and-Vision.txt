Sound and Vision

 A man who lost all of his senses except sight and hearing meets a young woman with synaesthesia, a condition which causes one sense to be felt through another. The film chronicles their relationship as he attempts to vicariously reconnect with what he's lost and provides a richly visualized realization of their mutual conditions.
