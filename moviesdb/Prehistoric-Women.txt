Prehistoric Women

 Tigri (Laurette Luez, working her way up to Bomba and Bowery Boys films) and her stone-age girl friends hate all men, but realizing they are a necessary evil, capture some for potential (strictly business, no recreation allowed) husbands. Engor (Allan Nixon, working his way down to the Mesa of Lost Women) escapes and, in his travels, discovers fire. This comes in handy later, after he has been recaptured by the women, when he drives off a dragon, or something, with his new discovery. This little feat has the effect of making the women realize their rightful subservient position, and he and Tigri have a primitive (non-catered) wedding, and go off to start a new tribe of fur-wearers. A civilization of gorgeous cavewomen abduct men for mating purposes. One of their victims is Engor, who seems to be smarter than the rest of the men. He discovers fire, battles a monstrous giant and attempts to win the hand of the prehistoric queen.
