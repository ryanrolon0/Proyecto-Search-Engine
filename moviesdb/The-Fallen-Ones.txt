The Fallen Ones

 Five thousand years ago, in Sumer, the fallen angels had intercourse with human females and their offspring were a race of giants called Nephilim, destroyed by the great flood. The evil angel Ammon mummifies his son Aramis to save him, and hides in hell. In the present days, the archaeologist Matt Fletcher finds Aramis tomb with excavating for building a resort for the entrepreneur Morton. The engineer Angela joins the team, giving support in the diggings. When some workers mysteriously vanish, Morton hires the security force of Ammon to find the missing men. However, his real intention is to resurrect Aramis in the eclipse of the moon and dominate the human race with a new breed of giants. Archaeologist Matt Fletcher uncovers a hidden tomb containing the mummy of a giant that's been buried since the time of the great flood in the Bible. Now, Matt has to stop a Fallen Angel who has come to earth to revive the giant and bring about a new age of these terrible creatures! The Fallen Ones, an ancient cult in Egypt that worshiped giants. One such giant was Aramis, who's father is a fallen Fallen Angel who had Armamis mummified to save his spirit from the great flood. Time passes and it's 2005 and a team of Archaeologists have found the tomb lead by clues in ancient text. But one of them is not who they appear to be, he is the Fallen One and has plans on resurrecting Aramis and start a new race of giants and destroy all of humankind. Unless Matt and his team can find a way to take down a hundred foot mummy.
