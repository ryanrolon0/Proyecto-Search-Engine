Shakalaka Boom Boom

 If the music industry is considered ruthless, manipulative and cutthroat, these terms certainly do not apply to A.J., the most popular singer/composer New York has ever seen. However, if prodigious talent, passion, and attitude are considered synonymous with the music industry, then Reggi fits the bill. Young and hugely talented, he hungers and craves for A.J.'s spot at the top. Into these lives enters two women singer Ruhi and the ambitious P.R. professional Sheena. Ruhi, while she has much professional respect for A.J., she has been wooed and won over by Reggi. Sheena, on the other hand, holds a grudge against Reggi because, while she did a lot for him as a PR, he had rejected her in a personal relationship. As A.J. and Reggi face off against each in a do or die battle, envy and betrayal rear their ugly heads, and talent struggles to survive the onslaught of a carefully orchestrated smear campaign. The movie revolves around two men with a similar passion- music. AJ (Bobby Deol) is playing a ruthless guy with a manipulative frame of mind.He has reached where he is through sheer dint of slog and hard work. He is used to winning, he revels in it and will never allow anybody to overtake him. Reggi (Upen Patel) is a talented and upcoming singer who is struggling hard to get noticed.Young and hugely talented, he hungers for what AJ has, he craves to be where AJ is. Ruhi (Kangana Ranaut) is an aspiring singer who looks up to AJ but she has fallen head over heels for Reggi. Sheena (Celina Jaitley) is a gorgeous and ambitious PR professional. Sheena is the one who goes all out to promote Reggi. There is a lot of drama in this part of the flick as the story involves a lot if emotions all mixed into one musical drama Shakalaka Boom Boom. Eventually, music emerges as the sole winner in the film.
