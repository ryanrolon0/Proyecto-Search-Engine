Trippin

 At a house party, Jesse makes his rounds from girl to girl, using his patented series of pick-up lines that have worked for him in the past. It is apparent to the ladies that his style and sincerity are questionable. When he migrates over to Linda, and begins to make a connection, a mysterious hand is seen slipping LSD into his drink. Jesse's mind and soul crosses over into a dark, horrible realm as the unnerving drug kicks into effect. His pleasant party turns into a night of horrors and hallucinations as he tries to survive in the dark, mysterious house, haunted by a tormenting ghoul, murder victims, vampire vixens, and the quaker ghost.
