The Blue Men

 On a small summer island, May and her grandson Bomber count the days. May's son, Bomber's father, is on Death Row. At Dawn, on September 1st, he will be executed. May retreats from this sad reality into a collection of postcards from happier days. Her son had been a thoughtful tourist once, who wrote of a mysterious desert tribe, The Blue Men, he sought but never found. Left to his own devices, Bomber, 13, roams the beach town with Edith, a punk teen-philosopher who is enthralled with the boy and his sad situation. Based on the award-winning short story by Joy Williams, THE BLUE MEN portrays a small family struggling to face, accept and endure their unusual tragedy.
