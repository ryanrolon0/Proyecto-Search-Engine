Running Around San Francisco for an Education

 A typical student at San Francisco Junior College is shown going through a normal day. She must make several trips across town, because her classes meet at a number of different locations. The city commissioner of schools then cites this student's experience as just one example of why voters should approve an upcoming bond issue, in order to improve the city's educational facilities.
