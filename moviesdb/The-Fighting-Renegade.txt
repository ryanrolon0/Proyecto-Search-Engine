Looking for the man that framed him, he finds his onetime assistant Magpie who recognizes him and hires him to escort a scientific expedition. But once again he is framed for murder when the Professor is killed with his knife. Magpie then heads out to bring in his former boss. A government agent falsely accused of murdering a professor takes the identity of "The Puma", a Mexican vigilante leader, to hide his real identity and find the actual killers.
