Saint-Camille

 A town in Quebec did not want to die... For St-Camille, rural exodus was not an option. The villagers did not give up when faced with globalization and the closing of industries. Despite its declining population and the loss of its public services, the residents did not lose heart. They have decided to disregard trendy solutions (tax breaks to attract businesses, etc.) Their key words participative democracy, solidarity between generations, culture and creativity. In a 'direct cinema' style, the film witnesses the human and political adventure of these people, shaping the world according to their values, one day at a time. The director followed them over the course of four years with his camera, while facing the many challenges of this venture.
