Tremolo

 Michael Rickert is a 36 year-old displaced French Canadian living as a Vancouver street musician in Translink's music program. His passion for musical success is unwavering, and despite his shrinking window of opportunity he remains optimistic about his future. Armed with "the Three P's" of busking (patience, perseverance and a positive mental attitude) Michael faces each day determined in the face of a saddening truth, which could be lying in wait. \Tre"mo*lo\, n. cessation, so as to produce a tremulous effect.] (dictionary.com) For the last 15 years, Michael Rickert has been chasing his dream of musical success across the country. A wide-eyed optimist, he approaches life one day at a time and is confident that one day he will "make it." However, contrary to his verbal communication, his musical expression exposes his internal conflict of reaching for the dream through a rapidly shrinking window of opportunity. Since 1999 Michael Rickert has been performing to a generally apathetic audience on a regular basis in the crowded Skytrain stations of Vancouver, BC. It being the only real outlet he has in the city for his music, he is looking ahead to continuing his travels and moving on. When given the opportunity to create a musical composition in front of the camera he performs a piece that hints more at the fear of failure and regret then any notions of success. In the process, he has perhaps unknowingly achieved his goal of musical accomplishment.
