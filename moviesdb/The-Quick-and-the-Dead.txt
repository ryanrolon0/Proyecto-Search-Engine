The Quick and the Dead

 Ellen, an unknown female gunslinger rides into a small, dingy and depressing prairie town with a secret as to her reason for showing up. Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while townfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule man that set up the contest, Herod. Herod is also the owner, leader, and "ruler" of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ... The blonde stranger riding into town isn't Clint, it's Stone. She's tough (can fist fight with the best of them), and an accurate and fast gun. There's a gunfighting competition in town. The quick and the brave sign up. The prize is a huge pot of money, but not everyone is in it for the riches, some seek revenge, others respect, but only one can win. Oh, did I mention the local bad guy who runs the town as well as the competition. The story focuses on 'The Lady', a gunfighter visiting the town of her father's killer, John Herod. At the time of her visit, a contest is being held. A contest of dueling. She joins, thinking it will help her get vengeance, and meets former henchman for Herod, Cort, and Herod's son, 'The Kid'.
