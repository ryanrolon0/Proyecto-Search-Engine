Secret of Permanency

 This documentary reveals the spiritual journey of a young girl discovering the echoes of ancient Persia through the remaining historical monuments in Esfahan, Iran. She has traveled from another part of the world to Iran just to see and discover the city of Esfahan tapping into an insight of contemporary Islam. Her journey begins when she realizes the image of the Shah (Iman) Mosque's reflection on the waters surface. By observing closely the intricate detail and artwork on the tiles she is synchronized with this ancient Persian world. Through use of color and light the decorated inscriptions reveal the holy names and writings praising prophet Ali. The ornamental mosque doors, the ascetic small chambers, the beauty of the Zayanderood River with its majestic bridges and many other amazing sights form the path for her spiritual journey and discovery of ancient and modern Persia. To enhance this meditative visual journey the film will use computer generated imagery and a hypnotic soundtrack composed by Rahi Sinaki tracing the roots of traditional Persian music.
