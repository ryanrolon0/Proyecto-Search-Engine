The Man Who Loved

 Sarah is depressed, angry, and frustrated. She begins to act out in increasingly alarming ways that disturb her laid-back husband, George. She commits a mundane act of violence for apparently no reason, and he reveals it publicly, humiliating her. She responds by humiliating him. They hurt each other, they love each other, they ignore each other. This is a story not about a plot, but about the texture of a relationship.
