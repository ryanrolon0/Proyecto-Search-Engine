Run, Drop, and Glide

 This featured short is a musical that parodies 1960 Surfing Movies. It is a farcical ride through the sport of women's skimboarding with an underlying tone of their fight for recognition within their sport.To date, the sport of skimboarding has no music of it's own, that is until now. It is a tribute to 'B' movie making, as if we saved a skimboarding classic from the 60's, and edited what little footage we have found to give us our story.
