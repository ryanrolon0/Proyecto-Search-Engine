The Nemesis Bird

 Avid bird watcher Dale Sarles reports what he believes to be a rare bird, the elusive Band Rumped Storm Petrel. When it turns out to be just an Ashy Petrel, Dale refuses to admit his error, and the local Audubon society removes him as chapter secretary, his wife leaves him, and his reputation in the birdwatching community crumbles. A year later, Dales son Ian, hears a report that the actual bird may have been sighted in the area and Dale sees a last chance for redemption.
