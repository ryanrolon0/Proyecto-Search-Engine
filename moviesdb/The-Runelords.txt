The Runelords

 People in this fantasy world give their attributes of strength, agility, wit, and more to their liege lords so they become super-human and help defend and protect the populace. Of course, others are forced into giving their attributes to the bad guys under pain of death. Based on the best selling novel "The Runelords" by David Farland, this movie takes place in a fantastical land where a person's gifts of strength, sight, smelling and other may be passed on to others as "attributes." But in this land, the tyrant Raj Ahten rises in the south and seeks to be the 'Sum of All Men.' Only the newly crowned Gaborn might be able to stop him, if he knows how to use his powers as an Earth King...
