Riding Derrick

 Riding Derrick is the story of a medieval knight re-enactor and bouncy castle operator at Grady Graham's Medieval theme park. Derrick's touchy relationship with his possessed horse costume, Franklyn, both aids and threatens his last chance to win the hand of his fair maiden, Amy the park's face painter. As Amy's final day of work draws to a close, Derrick must overcome some serious competition from his dueling partner and nemesis, Kennard. The question is, who poses the greater threat to Derrick's success?
