The Legend of Pete Jones

 "The Legend of Pete Jones" is an absurd, wacky short mockumentary that takes a searing look into the crusade of a great American journalist, whose unyielding fight for peace, equality, and a good sandwich may have been what got him killed, but who knows. It's like watching an "E! True Hollywood Story" on drugs if you've ever taken any.
