Themis

 The silent film illustrates its creator's belief that the thematic structure of visuals is the same as that of music. Against a background that is blue or pink - or sometimes briefly yellow or orange - geometric shapes appear and move pencils, rectangles. As colors change, the shapes move, spin, and rest. Sometimes, the change of colors reflects the shapes bumping into each other. Tableaus appear like Braque paintings.
