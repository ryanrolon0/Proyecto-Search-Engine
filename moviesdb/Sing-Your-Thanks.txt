Sing Your Thanks

 Using "Thank You for a Lovely Evening" as the opening number, in this entry in Universal's "Sing and Be Happy" shorts, The King's Men offer an audience-participation in the chorus so the the ladies can compete with the men in the theatre audience. Other songs heard are "I Was Seeing Nellie Home" and "Thanks for the Buggy Ride." As usual, the short contained animated backgrounds.
