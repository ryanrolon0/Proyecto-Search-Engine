Tongue Bully

 On the streets of Havana, Learie McNicolls, a dancer from Trinidad, recites poems he's written as his music plays. The poems are of love, loss, and freedom. Although solitary women watch from time to time, it's basically the poet facing the camera simply in black overalls and a white singlet, performing, moving, and gesturing.
