Shades of Grace

 A seemingly ordinary night out at a local restaurant turns out to be anything but routine as Anne Dearborn is thrust into extraordinary circumstances that challenge her perceptions of herself and her world. While apparently awaiting the arrival of her dinner companion, Anne strikes up a conversation with David, a frustrated writer who frequents the restaurant in search of inspiration. Over the course of the evening, David's penetrating observations of Anne unnerve her. Her partner's unexplained absence and David's intensifying scrutiny force a showdown that will change their lives forever. The personalities and dispositions of the wait staff and patrons contribute to the surreal atmosphere and lend a mythic quality to David and Anne's slice-of-life, emotionally charged exchange.
