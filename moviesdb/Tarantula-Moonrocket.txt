Tarantula Moonrocket

 Middle aged metal rock star Tarantula Moonrocket's career is going down the toilet. He rejects demands from his record company and his manager to be in a reality TV show and to fake scandalous behavior in order to increase publicity. Tarantula is put in a corner when he discovers that the record company own his name, image and likeness and it seems he has no choice but to follow their orders.
