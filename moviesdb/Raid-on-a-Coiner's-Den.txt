Raid on a Coiner's Den

 A gang of criminals has set up a hideout with equipment that they use to make counterfeit coins. When a detective notices one of the gang entering the hideout, he goes to get more policemen to stage a raid. When they arrive, they find most of the gang gone, so the detective decides to wait in the hideout so that he can catch them when they return. But it is not long before he discovers that he has placed his life in danger.
