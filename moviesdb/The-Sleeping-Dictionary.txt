The Sleeping Dictionary

 An eager young Englishman is dispatched to Sarawak to become part of the British colonial government, encounters some unorthodox local traditions, and finds himself faced with tough decisions of the heart involving the beautiful young Selima, the unwitting object of his affections. In 1936, the expatriated young and naive just-graduated British John Truscott arrives to the Sarawak, a British colony, to work in the Iban society. The beautiful Selima is assigned to be his "sleeping dictionary", to live and sleep with him and teach him the language and habits of the locals. The reluctant John and Selima fall in love for each other in a forbidden romance.
