The Buddha of the Piano

 This documentary is an homage to the legendary Leopold Godowsky (1870-1938) who was the greatest pianist of all time. It hits the highlights of his busy, peripatetic career, shares his thoughts about music and life, and summarizes his achievements as pianist, arranger, composer and teacher. This one and only film about Godowsky is generously illustrated with archival photographs, documents and scores, and piano rolls, and unfolds against a backdrop of Godowsky's legendarily difficult music (performed by Iturrioz). Rachmaninoff said, 'Godowsky has given us a lasting, a real contribution to the development of piano music.' Popular during his lifetime, he is unjustly unknown today. The film is endorsed by world class pianists Byron Janis, Marc-Andre Hamelin and Gary Graffman. ( 57 minutes ) See www.theartofthelefthand.com.
