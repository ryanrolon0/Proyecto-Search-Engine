The Second 100 Years

 Two convicts (Laurel & Hardy), in an escape attempt, tunnel into the warden's office, instead. They then disguise themselves as painters and walk out the front gate. Needing new clothes, they steal suits from visiting dignitaries, take their places in a limousine, and are delivered back to the same prison for a tour.
