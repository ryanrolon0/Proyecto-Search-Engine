The Power of the Press

 Bill Mawson, mayor of a small western town, runs things for his own profit. His enemy is a local paper, and he has succeeded in driving the editor out of town. John Marsden, the new editor, arrives, and Mawson attempts to make him his tool. Marsden refuses and denounces and exposes the mayor. He starts a conspiracy to get rid of him. The mayor's niece overhears the plot and warns Marsden. He refuses to fly. A revolver is placed on his desk and he proceeds with his work. He hears footsteps and looking up is covered with guns by masked men. He is overpowered but succeeds in recognizing Bill Mawson, the mayor. To a tree he is dragged. The rope is put around his neck. He refuses to obey the mayor. Everything is ready when Nettie dashes up with the police. Marsden takes Nettie in his arms and graciously intervenes for the release of Mawson, who extends his hand and promises to mend his ways.
