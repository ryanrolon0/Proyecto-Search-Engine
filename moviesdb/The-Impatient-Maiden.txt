The Impatient Maiden

 Myron Brooks, a medical-school student, graduates and starts his internship at a hospital. He asks his sweetheart, Ruth Robbins, to marry him but she refuses to until he has established his practice. Meanwhile, she goes to work as a secretary for an attorney, Albert Hartman, and he is so impressed with her dictation abilities that he sets her up a place to practice her dictation and other secretarial skills. It is only after she is taken to a hospital with an appendicitis attack, and young Doctor Marlowe performs a successful appendectomy on her that she decides to give up her night job and marry Dr. Brooks.
