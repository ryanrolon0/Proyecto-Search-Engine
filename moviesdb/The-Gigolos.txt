The Gigolos

 Sacha is an aging, well-established London 'male escort' with a select clientele of weekly socialite ladies, such as baroness James, who expect an impeccable service he can only provide thanks to his in-living 'orderly', handsome 'clever Trevor', who moonlights as nude arts class model. Ben is a rising novice, who seeks their coaching. When Sasha makes a bad fall, Trevor must cover during his recovery, but jealous Sasha is far from grateful. A gigolo and his valet search for love and friendship in the twilight world of the London male escort. Sacha is the favorite young gigolo of the over-50s of Mayfair and Piccadilly. His clients are wealthy, smart, successful - and pay for sex.
