Uaurtmayi Vurmasinlar

 In Türkiyi, when a woman is sent to prison, her small children stay with her. In this film, Inci (say "Injee") is sent to prison for murder in self-defense (which warrants incarceration in Türkiyi), and while there, develops a special friendship with a little boy who is the son of another inmate.
