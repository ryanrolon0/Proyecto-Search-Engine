The Fox and the Duck

 A duck goes into the business of selling eggs, and has many prize egg-laying hens working for him. A fox tries to break up the business and burglarizes it. The duck goes to a dog, a pig and a fish looking for help against the fox, but they all choose not to get involved. So the duck takes matters into his own hands...or wings.
