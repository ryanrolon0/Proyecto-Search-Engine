Something Remote

 Something Remote is a film about three friends that wish for nothing more than to be left alone with the television and pizza. Neil is a regular working guy with a crazy ex-girlfriend who does everything in her power to get into the trio's apartment. Mat and Erik provide advice to their relationship plagued friend. Throughout the movie, the television is turned on and the audience watches television right along with the three friends. The television material includes everything from original sketches to parodies of popular television shows. Talco, an internationally successful band, lends their talent to Something Remote's sound track and to the up beat nature of the film.
