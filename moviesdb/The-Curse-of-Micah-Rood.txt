The Curse of Micah Rood

 Micah Rood is an 18th Century recluse who cherishes only his privacy, his memories of lost loved ones, and above all... his precious apple orchard. A man no longer interested in social graces or financial success, Rood's withdrawal from society leaves him suspicious, resentful, and even paranoid. So when a traveling peddler seeking lodging for the night visits Rood and makes reference to the remarkable brand of apples he cultivates and the potential for profit the two of them might share together, it strikes a chord long gone sour. Rood commits a heinous act that manifests itself into a bizarre haunting which eventually taints the fruit of his orchard with the blood of guilt.
