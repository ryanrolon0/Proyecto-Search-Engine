Svoya chuzhaya zhizn

 Director Andrei Kalistratov is shooting a TV mini-series about the literary life of Petrograd after the Civil War, about the House of Art, which was established by the Bolsheviks in order to control the creative intelligentsia. It was a time with a rise of artistic life in the former capital of Russia. But the rise ended quickly and tragically with arrests and executions. Modern St. Petersburg and Petrograd of 1921 strangely and intricately intertwine in the mind of the director. The cruel, bloody, but romantic world of the first years of the Revolution converge with the artistic and domestic life of contemporary filmmaking on the same ground, on the same streets and squares.
