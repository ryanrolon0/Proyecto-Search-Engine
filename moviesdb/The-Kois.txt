The Kois

 The ups and downs of teen life are magnified by an all-girl high school rock band, led by reserved music prodigy, Shayna McAllister. School bullies "Phat Boy" Jonson, a white rap star clone, and acid-tongued web-blogger Kelly Billings, 'have it in' for Shayna. School hottie Chad Brocville, Kelly's ex, has an on-again-off-again crush on Shayna. Her best friend Will worries he'll be perennially dateless while their down-to-earth friend Martha tries to balance her parents' ambitions with her role as Shayna'a friend and band manager...Helping Shayna to keep it together are her band mates-uber competitive soccer player Mallory, trend-setter Lauren and impressionable posh girl Gillian - and new music teacher, Mr. Frank James. A former rock star, Frank inspires the band as much as they inspire him. If only he didn't have to deal with Principal Solomon. "The Kois" combines the truthful drama of "Degrassi" with the comedy of "Hanna Montana". Through our main characters, the series explores today's teen issues with a comic twist, and is really about what teens talk about and laugh about. Each episode features catchy rock songs from Shayna's band that reflect that episodes theme.
