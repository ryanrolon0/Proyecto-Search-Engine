Street of Pain

 On a gritty city sidewalk, a short man flanked by two large men runs a three-card monte game. He cheats to defeat a woman who runs off in despair. Enter, across the street, a silent man, well dressed in suit, tie, and fedora. He sees the three across the street and recalls a day during his childhood when the same three humiliated him, throwing dodge balls at him and laughing as he lay supine. The man in the fedora kicks over a store display of dodge balls, sending them rolling in all directions. He's set to take his revenge, years later. Soon, it's mano a mano. On this street of pain, will silent, determined justice triumph over the sneering cheater?
