Tesfaye

 Ethiopia suffers from some of the most environmental damage the world has ever seen. Over deforestation has left tracts of land in ruin driving away animals, sapping the ground of nutrients, and even drastically altering precipitation patterns. This short documentary follows Tesfaye, a middle-aged native Ethiopian who has witnessed over the past 30 years the consequences of such environmental abuse, and his search for a hope of restoration.
