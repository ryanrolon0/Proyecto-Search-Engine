Utsav

 Based on the 6th century A.D. Sanskrit play "The Golden Toy Chariot" by the famous Indian playwright Bhasa, "Utsav" faithfully follows Bhasa's story-line. Vasantasena, a courtesan who dances at the King Palaka's court hides in Charudatta's house while running away from the amorous attentions of the king's brother-in-law. She falls in love with Charudatta, though he is married and penniless. They have an affair. Meanwhile, the rightful heir to the throne - King Palaka's brother - escapes from prison. While he is being pursued by the king's troops, Charudatta helps him. The king's brother-in-law strangles Vasantasena when she refuses to submit to him and leaves her for dead. When Charudatta tries to have her jewels pawned, he is arrested for her murder. What happens to him and the other characters constitutes the final part of the film. Circa 16h century in India, Vasantsena is a proud and wellknown courtesan, who is wooed by the King's brother-in-law, Sansthanak, though in vain, as she does not accept his advances. She is instead with love with struggling artist, Charudatta, who is married to Aditi, but attracted to Vasantsena. The news of this affair raises an outcry, and Sansthanak finds the lifeless body of Vasantsena, and declares that the killer is none other than Charudatta, who will soon be hanged, accused of a murder he claims he did not commit.
