The Stranger from Pecos

 Nevada Jack McKenzie (Johnny Mack Brown) rides into the town of Blackwell, to discover that Sheriff Ben (Roy Barcroft) and town banker Ward (Sam Flint) head up a gang of thieves. U.S. Marshal Sandy Hopkins (Raymond Hatton) arrives in time to see his old pal, Marshal Bill Barstow (Robert Frazer), killed, and his son Tom Barstow (Kirby Grant) held for a robbery and murder done by the gang. Nevada frees Tom and hides him out in the cafe run by Clem Martin (Steve Clark), father of Tom's sweetheart, Ruth (Christine McIntyre). Sandy is working undercover as a saloon swamper, and learns many plans of the gang.
