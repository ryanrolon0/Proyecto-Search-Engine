Psycho III

 Norman Bates is still running his little motel, and he has kept the dressed skeleton he calls mother. One of his guests is a young girl who has left the convent where she lived. To get some help he employs a young man. One day a nosey journalist comes to see him to ask questions about his past. One month after the events of PSYCHO II, Norman is still running the Bates Motel along with "Mother". Things are going fine until Norman falls in love with a fallen nun, takes in a greedy drifter, a nosy reporter sticks her nose where it doesn't belong and a series of murders begins once again. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is still running Bates Motel all alone and keeping the dressed skeleton of the killer from PSYCHO II. He meets three new people who come to the Motel convent named Maureen (Diane Scarwid), a guitarist desperate for money named Duke (Jeff Fahey) and a nosy reporter named Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell), who is writing an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. As Norman and Maureen begin having a romantic relationship, someone dressed as Mother begins to kill people around the Motel one-by-one. Is Norman taking orders from Mother again, is Tracy trying too hard to prove that Norman is a viscous serial killer, or is there something much more than the obvious?
