Too Close to the Bone

 On a hot July afternoon, a girl wanders away from a house, towards a deserted pool of water. Her body is recovered the next day. Thirty years later, as Allon White lay dying of leukemia, he draws upon memories of his sister's death and the landscape of his childhood. These fractured recollections are the inspiration for Too Close To The Bone.
