Selfless, Cold and Composed

 The story of a romance in the middle stages. Eddie is a slightly recognizable pulp-novelist, his girlfriend, Clare, is a barely known song-stylist. Eddie works best locked off away from the world while Clare's inspiration comes from everything around her. Together they must find a balance between work and pleasure, adoration and annoyance, love and lust.
