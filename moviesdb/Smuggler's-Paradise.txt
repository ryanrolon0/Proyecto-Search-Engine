Smuggler's Paradise

 In the bayou, you never know what is around the next bend. From rattle snakes to drug smugglers, old hunting cabins can be home to anyone or anything. We will meet Criminal Investigations Captain, Chuck Bastak, and Will Irby, a private detective in action. From the jail to the bayou, experience how investigators process their surroundings. This is not about getting the bad guy, but about understanding the ideology of the criminal nature and law enforcement.
