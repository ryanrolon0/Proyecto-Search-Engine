The Music's Gonna Get You Through

 Henry Butler is not only a virtuoso Jazz artist, but also a passionate educator and advocate for disability rights. Drawing on his New Orleans heritage, extensive music study and experience making his way in the world as a blind black man, Henry crafts an eclectic curriculum that encourages his students to take themselves seriously and see the lessons in creating art and music as tools for survival. The Music's Gonna Get You Through tracks the impact of Butler's music and musical philosophy on a group of visually challenged teens who gather in New Orleans one summer to train with the master at his week long camp.
