Tsirk

 Alexei Krugliakov is serious about being funny. He's studying to become a clown at the State School for Circus and Variety Arts, in Moscow. It's a tough discipline which requires physical fitness and total dedication. In Tsirk, Alexei is our guide to the school, a shabby relic of a vast Soviet circus system instituted to entertain the masses and spread propaganda. While Alexei practises his pratfalls, the committed and underpaid staff remember better, but less free, days.
