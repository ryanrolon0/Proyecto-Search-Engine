The Summer of the Massacre

 Based on supposable true life events set in the English outback. Four teenagers take a shortcut across the countryside on their way home from college. They arrive in an obscure town named Blackwood where they are terrorized by notorious serial killer, Hammerhead, who hunts humans and devours their flesh. His favored tool of death is a large hammer.
