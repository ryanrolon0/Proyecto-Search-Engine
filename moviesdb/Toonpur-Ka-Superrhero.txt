Toonpur Ka Superrhero

 There is trouble brewing in the land of cartoons-Toonpur. The good guys of Toonpur (Devtoons) and the bad guys (Toonasurs) are at constant war. That's when Devtoons decide to take superstar action hero Aditya's help and get him down to Toonpur. But things are not as simple as the Devtoons had thought. Aditya lives a wealthy lifestyle in Mumbai along with his wife, Priya; son, Kabeer, and a daughter. He is a busy movie actor with no dates available until 2017. While his movies require him to wear a superhero costume, most of the work is done by stunt-men and stand-ins. One day he receives an irresistible offer from a Hollywood Producer, and is taken to a strange non-human land, Toonpur. This is where he will face his biggest challenge as these non-humans, who have mistaken him for a real life hero, will ask him to combat oppressive forces. He attempts to seek peace the Gandhian way but is mocked. He then arms himself with Yam Raj's Toon Astra and is all set to fight tyranny - until he is told that Priya and the children have been abducted and are being held separately - and will not be released until he surrenders and gives up the Toon Astra.
