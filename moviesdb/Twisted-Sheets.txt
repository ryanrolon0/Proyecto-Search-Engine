Twisted Sheets

 Sue is trying to get over a break-up with Dale. She goes out to get coffee in her nightgown and meets him and his new girlfriend, Sabrina, in the convenience store. Mortified she leaves and finally accepts an invitation from a lesbian friend to go to an all-girl bar that night. She's surprised to see Sabrina there dancing with women. They begin to talk, dance, and end up in bed. Dale, on the rebound, doesn't know and tries unsuccessfully to get back together with Sue.
