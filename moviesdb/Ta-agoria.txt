Ta agoria

 Psychological drama of Greek-English production, in which an employee of the British Embassy, Liz, meets a hospitalized patient covered in burns. He tells her a strange story about five teenagers who met years ago on an island and whose youthful pranks caused someone's death. Their meeting at the scene of the tragedy, twenty-five years later, brings back the traumatic experiences of the past. To redeem themselves, they decide to sacrifice that which is most valuable to them - their lives. One of them, Nanta, cuts his throat with glass, while the painter, Tim, hangs himself from an interior staircase. Following the suicide of the third, Jonathan, the rest of the group, Stewart and Christian, decide to set fire to the house and burn with the bodies of their friends. Liz, deeply affected by the narration, realizes with horror that the injured man is Stewart, who after completing the story, and Liz's departure, takes his own life. However, he is not the only survivor. Christian, who was also rescued by an islander, decides to give himself up to justice. Some years later, he is released from prison, having experienced the "freedom of prison" as atonement for everyone's sins.
