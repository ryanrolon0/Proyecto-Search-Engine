Singing on the Trail

 Jerry Easton and Dan Prichard, disreputable owners of the swanky Circle A dude ranch in Arizona, pretend to sell the property to the Hoosier Hotshots (Ken, Hezzie, Gil and Gabe), while switching the bill-of-sale for a worthless piece of paper. But when the swindlers plan to sell the ranch to Terrance Mallory, they discover the Hotshots actually hold true bill-of-sale. They hire a few henchmen and try to force the Hotshots into returning the deed, but Curt Stanton and "Big Boy" Webster, friends of the Hotshots, take a hand in the game.
