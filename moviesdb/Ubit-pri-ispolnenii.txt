Ubit pri ispolnenii

 Film-biography of Waclaw Worowski, a Moscow-born Pole turned Soviet revolutionary extremist. He operated in Europe under diplomatic cover surreptitiously financing pro-communist groups and preparing violent revolutions in several nations. In 1923, while operating in Switzerland, Worowski was killed by Maurice Conradi, a Swiss-Russian anticommunist, who declared that the killing of Worowski was a fare punishment for the crimes committed by him and the Soviet communist regime. Maurice Conradi was acquitted by Swiss court. Then Soviet Union broke all relations with Switzerland.
