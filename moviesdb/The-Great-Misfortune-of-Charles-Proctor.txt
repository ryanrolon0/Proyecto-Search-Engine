The Great Misfortune of Charles Proctor

 Dr. Charles Proctor, brilliant scientist, led the perfect life - until he fell victim to a terrible lab accident that changed things forever. Relegated to be a cripple for the rest of his days, it slowly drove him to madness. Years after his involuntary retirement from his research at Sandell Corp, Proctor hires a young man named Bradley to help satiate his wife Mary's basic needs - as he sees them. In the meantime, Proctor secretly conducts the remnants of his unfinished experiments in his own primitive laboratory, while Bradley suffers silently under the unsettling conditions of Proctor's requests. Charles himself is soon to meet his own misfortune as this tale of perverse hope unfolds into a startling revelation for all.
