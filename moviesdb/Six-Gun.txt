Six Gun

 When three cowboys show up dead, Tommy, a hard-drinking, retired bounty hunter whose ranch is on the brink for foreclosure, must saddle up one more time to stop the bandit and collect a ransom. Prepare yourself to go back in time to the real old west, when he takes the law into his own hands and kills anyone in his way.
