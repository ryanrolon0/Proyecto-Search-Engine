Selfish Yates

 "Selfish" Yates operates a disreputable saloon on the desert's edge in Arizona. Mary Adams and her sister Betty, having lost their father crossing the desert, arrive in the town of Thirsty Center and appeal to Yates for help and work. Yates is none too helpful, suggesting dance-hall work for Mary. She refuses , taking instead a menial job assisting Yates' cook. Yates is a hard case, but little by little Mary's influence works a renewal of humanity in him, until at last he finds himself tested by crisis.
