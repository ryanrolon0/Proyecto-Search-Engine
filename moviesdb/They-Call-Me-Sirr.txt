They Call Me Sirr

 Sirr Parker, raised in tough South Central Los Angeles, was abandoned by his junkie mother and raised by his grandmother until Coach Griffin takes him under his wing at Locke High School. Meant to be an inspirational story, the former Texas A&M standout was signed as a 1998 undrafted rookie free agent by the San Diego Chargers and makes the practice squad but was waived and signed by two more teams before he finally switched positions and stuck with the Cincinnati Bengals for the last three games of the 2000 season. He was then released for a very minor violation of team off-season rules regarding place of residence.
