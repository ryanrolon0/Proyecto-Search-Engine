The Tweakers

 The Tweakers is an Ultra low-budget digital comedy about three tweakers (guys hooked on methamphetamines) hired as hit men by a drug dealer to kill his new girlfriends husband. These fried tweakers are so far gone, they have strange quirks that make them different. One (Turtle) is scared of every animal that exists, another (General Patton) is a twitchy ex-military guy who spouts nonsense from time to time and spurts military jargon frequently. The third (Uggh) is so far gone, he believes he's a caveman. Hilarity ensues as the three Tweakers race against time and logic to kill an elusive man, dodge the crazy double cheeseburger guy, hire a dominatrix named Shadow and keep from getting killed by a man named Moose!
