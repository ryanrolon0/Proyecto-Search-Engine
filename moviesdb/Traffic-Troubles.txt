Traffic Troubles

 Mickey is driving a taxi. His first fare is a very large gentleman. Mickey stops traffic and gets a tongue-lashing from the officer. The cab runs into some bad road, bounces the fare down to almost nothing, then bounces the customer right out of the cab. Mickey pulls up to the curb and picks up his second passenger, Minnie. She plays her accordion while they ride. The cab gets a flat tire, and Mickey uses a pig to pump it up. Snake oil salesman Pegleg Pete happens by and pours some of his elixir into the car; it takes off without him, crashes, loses its wheels, and lands on a cow. The cow takes off, crashes into a barn, and then a poultry shed.
