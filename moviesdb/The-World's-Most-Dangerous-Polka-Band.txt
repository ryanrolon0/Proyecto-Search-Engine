The World's Most Dangerous Polka Band

 Loud music, late nights, and lots of ladies - just a typical weekend night for a nationally recognized recording act, right? Sure, but throw in senior discounts, audiences who bark with the band, and 10,000 rolls of toilet paper. And that's only part of the irresistible, unforgettable charm of "The World's Most Dangerous Polka Band." Dangerous indeed - for their ability to prove you're never too old to live young!
