Remembering a Memory

 Explores the various stories inspired by the immense Celtic Cross constructed in 1909 on Grosse-Ile, a tiny island near Quebec City, which is the site of the largest cemetery outside Ireland connected with the Potato Famine of the 1840s. While the 1909 unveiling was a multicultural celebration of how French Canadians had aided the Irish, the 2009 events marking the centenary of the Cross focused on the Irish, leaving French Canadian out of the picture. This film reflects on how and why the memories evoked by Grosse-Ile have so dramatically shifted over the past century.
