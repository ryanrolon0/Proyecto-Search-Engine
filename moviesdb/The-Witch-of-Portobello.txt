The Witch of Portobello

 Athena, the witch of Portobello Road, begins her spiritual journey in this chapter from the book by Brazilian author Paolo Coehlo. In The Peter Sherney Chapter she learns 'the dance' that changes her life forever. This change influences the bank she works in and she is thus promoted to Dubai. Her personal development has a profound effect on the people in her life and particularly on her boss Peter Sherney.
