Tamanna

 The year is 1975, the place is Mahim, Bombay, and this is the story of Tikku, a eunuch, the only child of yesteryear Bollywood actress Nazneen Begum, who has fallen upon hard times, is virtually destitute and is dependent on Tikku, who does make-up/hair-dressing of Bollywood actresses. When she passes away, Tikku is beside himself with grief. After the funeral, he witnesses a woman leaving a child in a garbage bin. Tikku picks up the girl-child, longing for human company, especially after the death of his mom, decides to keep her, names her Tamanna, and brings her up on his own. When she is old enough, he arranges for her education in St. Mary's High School's hostel. When she completes school, she returns home to find out that Tikku in the guise of a Hijra and shuns him, but subsequently relents. Then Tikku finds out that Tamanna is the daughter of Ranvir Chopra, an up and coming politician, he tells her, and she goes to their palatial house. Watch what impact this has on the entire Chopra family, and the excuse they come up for abandoning Tamanna.
