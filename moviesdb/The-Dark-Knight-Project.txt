The Dark Knight Project

 Set between the events of Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight", two high schoolers attempt to be the first to capture video footage of Batman, and inadvertently encounter the masked vigilante who saves both their lives. "The Dark Knight Project" chronicles the adventures of Gotham Midtown students Heather Nolan and Mikey Bale, played by Allyssa O'Donnell and David Sanchez. Intent on being the first people in Gotham City to capture actual video of the Dark Knight in action for a school project, they set out with their video camera to interview people on the streets, witness the evacuation of a city block by police in the middle of a bomb scare, and ultimately encounter Batman in the middle of a back alley break-in where he saves both high schoolers from a menacing group of thugs working for the Joker.
