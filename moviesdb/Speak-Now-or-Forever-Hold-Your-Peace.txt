Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace

 The Holiday Season is usually a time for peace and quiet. But in Louie's bar that concept doesn't apply. There is never a dull moment. His customers are free spirited and like to voice their opinions. And when two feuding brothers accidentally come together, things get out of hand. Politically correct behavior escalates into open opinions and nonconformity that lead up to an uncontrollable climax. One that could possibly change everyone for better or for worse. Come sit in and be the judge, your opinion could make a difference.
