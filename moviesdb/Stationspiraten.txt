 A few adolescent boys share a very peculiar neighborhood of a hospital. Suffering from various forms of cancer, all of them face an uncertain future. They cope with their life-threatening situation through their joy of living. Friendship and experience play an important role for adolescents. But they become indispensable when your "formative years" are spent in pajamas and hooked up to pipes. However, sharing a somewhat similar fate doesn't make them equals. Each and every one of the boys has his own personal luggage to carry along with the deadly disease.
