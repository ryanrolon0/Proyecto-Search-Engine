Six in the City

 Tight-knight gal pals hold court over brunch at their favorite park. The usual girl talk eventually turns to the subject of boys, what's wrong with them and wondering why are they such pains. One finds herself curious about the opposite sex, especially a boy named SMALL. Another, who is more experienced with boys than the others, finds herself intrigued by JOEY, who invites her to hang out with his friends in a coffee shop with his five "Friends" swilling cocoa and shooting the breeze. Meanwhile, the red-head has a boy secret of her own soccer team. But the pampered junior WASP has the biggest stunner of all she has gotten a job working a paper route. Forget boys, Charlotte working? But her paper route leads her to cross paths with tough-but-sensitive bully TONY. As the girls figure out "where are boys from," their adventures bring the four girls together, inseparable as ever.
