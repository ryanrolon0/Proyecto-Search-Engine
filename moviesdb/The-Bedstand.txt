 Newly engaged couple Nick and Jenna are asked by Jenna's parents to house sit while they are away for the weekend. But like life, nothing really goes as planned. When a discarded condom etches its unmistakable shape on a cherished family heirloom, the couple frantically attempts to repair it before her parents come home only to become hilariously entangled with a lunatic crew of would-be helpers on both sides of the law.
