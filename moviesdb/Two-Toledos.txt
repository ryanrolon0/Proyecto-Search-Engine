Two Toledos

 In an exploration of cultural exchange through art, American documentary filmmakers Jacob David and Joel R. Washing focus on two distinctly different cities with the same name. Visually rich cinematography of the Toledo, Ohio skyline and the ancient architecture of Toledo, Spain illuminate the physical differences of the cities, while in-depth interviews with artists show the deep similarities between the cultures through the universal need to create.
