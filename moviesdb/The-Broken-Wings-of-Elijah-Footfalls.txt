The Broken Wings of Elijah Footfalls

 Inspired by Fellini, Chaplin, and magic realism, THE BROKEN WINGS OF ELIJAH FOOTFALLS revitalizes the image-driven art of the silent film. A lonely street juggler discovers a gypsy circus in a wooded valley. The film charts Elijah's love affair with Nina, the fire-breather, and his friendship with Ilja Wax, the circus director.
