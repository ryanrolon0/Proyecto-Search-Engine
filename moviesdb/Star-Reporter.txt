 John Randolph (Warren Hull), an idealistic young newspaper owner who uses his paper as an instrument for the public good, uses a campaign against crime to successfully run grafting politicians out of town. District Attorney William Burnette (Wallis Clark), father of Barbara Burnette (Marsha Hunt) who John loves, learns that John's father (unknown to John) is a criminal they are seeking. He refuses to prosecute him and John, not knowing the real reason, turns against Burnette and tries to run him out of office.
