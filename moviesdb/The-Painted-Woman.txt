The Painted Woman

 After becoming involved in a killing, Kiddo gets on board Boyton's ship. When he learns what happened he dumps her on a South Sea island. Tom Brian marries her, and when Boynton returns he's furious (he wanted to marry her). When Boyton is killed Kiddo is accused of the crime and even Tom thinks she's guilty.
