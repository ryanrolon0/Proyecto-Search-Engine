Rex regi rebellis

 For some people in our big world is just hard to exist. Klark is one of these people. He is has an underpaid totally lame work, he has a mean boss, rotten co-workers, lousy car and on and on. One day he is fired and then he just take a stand. He will not take this crap any more. Klark becomes a man he never thought he could be. He is now about to avenge his situation.
