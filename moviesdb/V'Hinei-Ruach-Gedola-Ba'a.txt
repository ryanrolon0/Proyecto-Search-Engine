V'Hinei Ruach Gedola Ba'a

 Benny and Rachel Yafet-bereaved parents from the agricultural community of Nezer Hazzani, and Rabbi Raffi Peretz-Lieutenant Colonel in reserves and head of the pre-military training academy in Atzmona. They are three strong and rooted characters who lived in Gush Katif until last August. The film follows their lives over the course of 8 months, until that same fateful day in which they were asked to leave their homes and their life`s work, entirely against their will and their beliefs.
