Road Rash 3

 This time around you start off with $1000 and a really lousy bike. As you progress in the races, you may divert yourself to the bike shop to get a new bike or important upgrades. By doing well in races you will receive various amounts of money. That money can then be used to buy faster and more competitive bikes later on in the game. This time, instead of just the USA, the races take place across different countries all over the world, all represented in a stereotypical manner. In the UK, cars drive on the left and there is rainy weather. In Kenya, animals will cross the road and you will hear some funky tribal beats. Of course, as you know, this isn't an ordinary racing game. While racing, you can engage in fighting with ordinary punches and kicks and weapons like crowbars, clubs, chains, a cattle prod, chain-sticks, and maces. The game is spiced up with humorous situations, funny winning screens, jumping over cows and the mighty crashes.
