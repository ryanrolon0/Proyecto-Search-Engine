The Last Wild Place with Christopher Reeve

 In his last film performance, Christopher Reeve delivers a passionate indictment of development plans for Mt. Greylock, southern New England's highest peak. Quoting Melville, Hawthorne, and Thoreau on the thirteen-thousand-acre Berkshire wilderness, Reeve highlights a remarkable 40-year effort to save this public treasure.
