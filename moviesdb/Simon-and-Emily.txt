 Simon and Emily are in love, but due to their misspent youth they find themselves having to collect souls to pay of their debt to the devil. They make the most of it and have fun in their cursed life - but just as they're drawing close to hitting their quota, a new man enters Emily's life, and she's not so sure if she wants to spend eternity with Simon after all...
