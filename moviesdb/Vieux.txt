 An 80-year-old woman woke up one morning in her new studio to realize that one of her medicines is missing.While she goes out to buy it, two men attempt to deliver a big package to her. A cardboard collector observes the delivery men and starts hovering around the building hoping he could get hold of the empty cardboard box.
