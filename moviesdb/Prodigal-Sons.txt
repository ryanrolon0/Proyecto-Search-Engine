Prodigal Sons

 Filmmaker Kimberly Reed returns home for her high school reunion, ready to reintroduce herself to the small town as a transgender woman and hoping for reconciliation with her long estranged adopted brother Marc. Things are complicated by the shocking revelation that Marc may be the grandson of Orson Wells and Rita Hayworth, forcing Kim and her family to explore questions of sexual orientation, identity, severe trauma and love. Paul McKerrow grew up in conservative Helena, Montana in the 1970's, the middle of three brothers, adopted 'Marc McKerrow' (qv) being the oldest, and 'Todd McKerrow' (qv) being the youngest. Paul was co-captain of the high school football team and voted by his class the most likely to succeed. But Paul never felt comfortable in his skin. Paul, now transsexual New Yorker 'Kimberly Reed' (qv), goes back to her high school reunion with her girlfriend 'Claire Jones (XIV)' (qv). Although all of Kimberly's classmates know about her sex change, she is still nervous to reunite with them as she has not seen them since the sex change. However she is more nervous about reuniting with Marc, who she has not seen in ten years and from who she is estranged. Their estrangement is due in part to their sibling rivalry in combination with the sex change and Marc not knowing his biological heritage - Kimberly states that she and Marc are both haunted by the ghost of Paul - and in part to neurological issues Marc has stemming from a head injury suffered in a car accident that occurred when he was twenty-one. Kimberly wants to reinvent their relationship into something positive. Kimberly hopes a point of connection will be supporting Marc in meeting his birth family (which has celebrity connections), but it ends up being another starting point for her to come to terms with her past as Paul.
