Tourists Playing Shuffleboard on 'Prinzessen Victoria Luise'

 A party of tourists playing shuffleboard and throwing rings on the sun-deck of the "Prinzessin Victoria Luise." The players have a hard time on account of the heavy sea. A steward, who is waiting on the players, slides across the deck on his hands and knees, much to the amusement of the passengers. (Taken on the midwinter cruise of the S. S. "Prinzessin Victoria Luise" of the Hamburg-American Line.)
