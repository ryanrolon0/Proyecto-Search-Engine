The Fresh Lover

 A young man is making love to a girl in the first story window of a house and is caught in the act by her father from the window above. The old man is enraged and espying an athletic chap nearby gives him a dollar and signals him in pantomime to lift the lover up where he can get at him. The athlete does so and the old gentleman pulls the lover's hair until he shouts for mercy.
