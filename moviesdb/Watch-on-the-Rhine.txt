Watch on the Rhine

 On December 16th, 1944, the Germans launched their final, desperate offensive. The brave boys of the 106th Infantry Division had only been in Europe for two weeks when they were attacked by half a million German soldiers. Private Boles is a hapless recruit. Unsure and inexperienced, he finds himself lost in the middle of the largest land battle of the second world war. Now he must make it back to camp safely, if he can survive the bombs, bullets, tanks, and cleverly disguised German spies masquerading as American soldiers. But how can Private Boles know he's actually safe, when any Americans he encounters could be the enemy in disguise?
