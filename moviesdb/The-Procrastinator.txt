The Procrastinator

 Jean, a high school student, has a habit of putting off tasks that need to be done. Her mother scolds her about it, but to no avail. Jean gets elected social chairman for the class dance, but with her usual unorganized work habits, everything is put off until the absolute last minute--and the school dance looks like it's going to turn into a disaster.
