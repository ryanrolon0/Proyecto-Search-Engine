Tomboy

 A female football player, who is a self-proclaimed tomboy, gets teased by her young neighbor about her virginity. Though protesting loudly, she does decide to act on it. She therefore goes on a date and has sex with her date in the back of his van. Meanwhile, her brother Teddy steps out of the shower naked just when his older neighbor accidentally walks in. He asks her to leave, but moments after he enters his room, the buxom neighbor barges in nude, throws him on the bed and dives down successfully for his privates. After he finally manages to stop her, they engage in consensual sex. She later explains she was inactive since her husband divorced her for a younger woman.
