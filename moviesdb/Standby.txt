Standby

 Alan (28) works at the Tourist Information Desk in Dublin Airport. Alice is a American on standby in the airport. eight years ago, Alan and Alice had a romance which ended badly. Now every hotel room in Dublin is booked out. Despite initial frostiness Alan offers Alice a room in his house to stay the night. They will spend the evening getting to know each other again. Both will tell lies about how well the last eight years have gone, however gradually, they will come to realize that perhaps they are more compatible than they ever were before. 'Standby' is about what happens when your twenties don't go how you planned. Its about falling in love, with a girl and a city again.
