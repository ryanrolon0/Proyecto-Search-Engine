Sister Margo Muse of Embers

 Midnight. A young nun goes to a tailor and asks him to make her a habit. The young tailor agrees, takes her measurements and tells her to come back the following night. When she returns she finds he had made her a red habit. She storms out angrily. He makes her a blue one and takes it to her through the woods. But he loses the blue habit to a raging river. Back home he writes her a poem retracting his feelings for her. While he is away she comes to his shops and finds the poem. She writes that he and all his colors have a home in her heart. After reading it he sews her wedding dress and they get married.
