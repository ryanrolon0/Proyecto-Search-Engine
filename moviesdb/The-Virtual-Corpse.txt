The Virtual Corpse

 Joseph Paul Jernigan broke into a house and then beat, stabbed, and shot a man to death. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to die by lethal injection. Jernigan decided to donate his body to science. After his execution, his body was used as part of the Visible Human Project. His body was frozen and then ground into sections which were then digitally imaged to provide a three-dimensional view of the human body.
