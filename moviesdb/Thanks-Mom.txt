Thanks Mom

 Brothers Dan and Jeremy are aspiring film-makers. When the economic crisis drains their pool of potential investors, they have no choice but to accept their Mother's offer to fund their feature film. Months later, with their movie nearly complete, their artistic vision runs headlong into their Mother's wholesome values. Through good old-fashioned motherly guilt and manipulation, she convinces them to change it. First goes the sex. Then the violence. Drugs, language, promiscuity, and on and on, anything that could possibly be deemed as offensive is stripped away. In the end, their movie is transformed from a dark, diverse film, into a white-washed, Disney like version of its former self. THANKS MOM is a comedy about art, film-making and a couple of Mamma's Boys.
