Themes & Intermissions

 After he's fired from his job just days after the turning of the New Year, while frantically looking for work with no success, a tap-dance of silence ensues between Brian (Dan Parilis) and his wife, Sharon (Christa Kimlicko-Jones). Days become weeks, and the invisible eggshells under their feet begin to crack, the pretense of carefree suburban bliss disintegrating all around them. With his marriage crumbling, desperation leads Brian down a slippery slope, starting with petty thievery, and veering towards something much darker and more foreboding... Themes & Intermissions is a whisper, not a shout; the slow horror of free-fall in a world in which stability can be lost in a single moment, and simply holding on can be a quiet kind of heroism.
