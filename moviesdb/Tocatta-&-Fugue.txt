Tocatta & Fugue

 After the death of his younger brother, Gil Tocatta becomes obsessed with his family curse and his premonition that he he too will be dead soon. A shadowy figure has started to follow Gil. And everywhere the figure goes, death follows. Gil must find who is killing those around him before it is too late; he must be willing to put love ahead of his own fear of death, and his life in the place of those he loves.
