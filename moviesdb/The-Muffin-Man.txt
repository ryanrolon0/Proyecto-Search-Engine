The Muffin Man

 Summer is over, the day-olds are a day older, and it's business as usual at the struggling donut shop on Drury Lane. Chad, Jane, and the rest of the staff have no idea that the shop's former proprietor - serial killing baker, Desmond Bailey - is about to return to the scene of his original crimes. Deformed, enraged, and possessed by a malicious demon, Bailey is more dangerous than ever. It's up to Hank, the grizzled detective who ended the baker's first killing spree, to convince the staff of the imminent danger. Will they heed his warnings before it's too late, or suffer a delicious demise at the hands of the menacing murderer with a massive muffin for a head? The heat is on, the timer is set, and a new evil is on the rise!
