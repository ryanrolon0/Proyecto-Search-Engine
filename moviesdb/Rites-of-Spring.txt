Rites of Spring

 A film set in the slums of Kampala, capital of Uganda, about translators overdubbing western films into the local language Luganda. Films screened in 'video halls' (slum cinemas) on old television sets get translated by a veejay who, using a clothes peg and open speaker wire, cuts the sound to allow for his own individual artistic interpretation of the narrative.
