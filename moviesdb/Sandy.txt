Sandy

 A Scots-Irish lad comes to America in hopes of finding his fortune. On the sea voyage, he meets and falls for a lovely young girl, but they are parted on arrival. Years later, in the Kentucky town where he has settled and prospered, he meets the girl again, and both complications and sparks arise.
