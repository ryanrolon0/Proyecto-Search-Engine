Unlocked

 Two guys accidentally unlock a wormhole after a training session. Tom drops his keys in the middle of a footy field catching up with Tim. His keys instantly creates a portal one and a half metres in diameter allowing anyone to instantly teleport from one side of the keys to the other. They have fun for a while then they get bored and shit happens, on a really tight budget. On a really tight everything actually. Yep, lots of fun.
