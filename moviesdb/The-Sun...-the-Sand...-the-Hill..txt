The Sun... the Sand... the Hill.

 'Sean Connery' (qv) is at the Cannes Film Festival where his latest movie, _The Hill (1965)_ (qv), is playing, it being the first of his starring role movies that has played at the festival. The movie tells of a British prison camp located in the desert. Southern Spain fills as the shooting location, a nonetheless harsh environment for those involved in the filming, which matches the difficulties faced by the characters in the film. The harsh filming location takes its toll on some of the cast and crew. Connery, director 'Sidney Lumet' (qv) and producer 'Kenneth Hyman' (qv) discuss the film's plot and the actual filming rigors, but also the joy of working with each other and the rest of the cast and crew to achieve the common vision for the movie. This short opens at the Cannes Film Festival in May of 1965, where Kenneth Hyman and Sidney Lumet's film, "The Hill," is in competition for the Palme d'Or. Then, an off-screen narrator takes us to a desert fort near Almería in Andalucía, where the cast and crew spent nearly 70 grueling days shooting the movie. We watch Lumet in action, see a few scenes, and get on-camera comments from Sean Connery and others. The message of this promotional short is that filming on location, with actors fainting from the heat, adds verisimilitude to a picture already rich in talent in and behind the scenes. Cannes makes it all worth it.
