Trillizas propaganda

 VIOLETA, ROSA and CELESTE, orphan triplets that have shared the same liquid environment from the maternal womb, are unbeatable champions in synchronized swim. They have been promoted by a small town Colonel that transformed them into the symbol of his political propaganda. Everything is arranged to participate in the Olympic Games, but Rosa falls in love.
