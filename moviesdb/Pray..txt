Pray.

 Some friends enjoy an out-of-town rock concert. After some eerie events at their hotel, the friends abandon their night of rest and decide to drive thru the night back to their hometown several hours away. However, someone or something follows them home. After a seemingly uneventful school day, events unfold that find the lead character alone at the Mall later that evening. As the night closes in, the mall closes, and we find our heroine mysteriously trapped inside. However, she is not alone. It will take her resolute strength and unflinching faith (and a few shocking "miracles" along the way) for her to escape the night.
