Raftbag

 Winner of 2011 DIY Film Fest's Best Feature Comedy Award, Raftbag is a beautifully shot comedy that takes an offbeat look at the lives of America's future generation living in and around Paducah Kentucky. Strange unexplained events keep occurring, and the fine cast keeps us grounded in this surrealistic comedy, seemingly unaffected by the chaos around them.
