The Summoning

 The Summoning takes the audience on on a pulsating, horrifying journey into the occult and the supernatural as a police Detective and a Wiccan college student become entangled in a frightening web of demons and evil spirits. Four young students are sadistically murdered, and an idyllic New England college is gripped with fear. Later, four more students are found bloodied, cut and savagely tortured to death. Is there a serial killer on the loose, or is this the work of some bizarre cult, ritualistically preying upon innocent young college students? Finding no murder weapon or any real clues -- except for a bloodied, shattered mirror-- the police are baffled. As paranoia threatens to paralyze the campus, and coeds hunker down in their dorm rooms, a young undergraduate - Nancy Patrick - begins her own investigation. Raised by hippie parents and schooled in Wicca, Nancy realizes that the police are on the wrong track. When Nancy and two friends venture to a wooded area near campus, she has disturbing and frightening visions...It was there, in the 1960's, that three college girls were brutally murdered by a crazed drifter. It was also there that some colonial-era Pagans suffered a horrible, fiery death while attempting to summon the legendary "mirror witch." As Nancy delves deeper and deeper into the campus murders, she begins to unravel a bizarre and frightening reality that threatens her own life. When her advisor is murdered, she briefly becomes a suspect before a sympathetic Wiccan cop realizes that they must work together to defeat the evil spirit.
