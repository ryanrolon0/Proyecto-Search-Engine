Submission

 Johnny (Ernie Reyes, Jr.) earns a meager existence working for his father as an auto-mechanic. At night, he races to the local MMA gym and trains with Sensei Gene (Ving Rhames) for a shot at becoming a Pro-MMA fighter. That is, until he falls for the Sensei's daughter (Sara Downing). Struggling to make extra cash for his young family, Johnny takes a job collecting for a steroid pusher. When the job goes south, he tries to pick up the pieces of his broken family, only to find that raw talent is not enough. He must learn the meaning of the word submission.
