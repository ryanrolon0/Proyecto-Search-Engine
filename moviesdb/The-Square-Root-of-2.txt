The Square Root of 2

 When his daughter Rachel, a spunky girl who has overcome a lifelong history of serious brain lesions, is accepted at a top tech university, Dr. Ben Lehrer is anxious for her welfare, but proud of her tenacity and independence. However, when Rachel is unjustly accused by her roommate of threatening behavior, Rachel and Ben are plunged into a Kafkaesque nightmare of insane rules and unjust regulations more appropriate to a Stalinist state than a modern American university. Her well-meaning supporters at the school, of which there are many, are helpless to assist her, their hands tied by the insanely convoluted strictures of the Office of Integrity, a draconian institution where the rules of law and common sense do not apply. Intent upon changing the system, Rachel risks her reputation, her hard-won graduation and her entire future to ensure that no one else suffers the same abuses that she has endured.
