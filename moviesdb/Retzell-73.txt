Retzell 73

 8 Months ago a deadly virus was discovered in Asia. Today, only very few survivors remain, where those who are not dead have become mindless flesh eating zombies. Andersson, a young man, believes he is the only survivor until he meets Voorhees, a very strange man who lives in a tall, abandoned apartment building. Andersson realizes that he does not want to live with this man, yet he knows that man is his only hope for survival and friendship. Eventually, Voorhees let's Andersson know that there is a cure, and they begin their search for the cure through the desolate streets of the small Swedish town.
