Slowly, Quickly

 Martin falls head over heels for, whom he believes to be, the perfect woman. But when he methodically interrogates Gina about their seemingly perfect relationship--and expresses fears and skepticisms about a potential future together--all goes awry. SLOWLY, QUICKLY is a short film that offers a glimpse into the complex reality of one man's need to find that special someone, slowly, but quickly.
