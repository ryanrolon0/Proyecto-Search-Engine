Time Spent

 George comes home from work to find her best friend, Bill, has attempted suicide in her apartment. After weeks of trying to move past this traumatic experience and regain their strong friendship, George is realizing that Bill is harmful to her health. They meet one last time in a coffee shop where George gives Bill a chance to move forward. He remains fixated on his unrequited love interest in George and on his own morbidity. George is sucked into Bill's escapist fantasies about suicide and her view of him is clouded by his obsession with death. In an attempt to find closure and move forward with life, George leaves Bill to his own devices and she enters back into the world of the living.
