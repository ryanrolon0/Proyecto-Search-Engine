Tristan und Isolde

 Considered incredibly difficult and expensive to put on, Tristan and Isolde is rarely performed, however thanks to Ms. Vlahos' brilliantly condensed version and a remarkable donor to YMF (who wishes to remain anonymous), Allport Productions and YMF were able to bring this production to the Broad Stage in Santa Monica and the screen. With the stage production directed by Ms. Vlahos and the television production directed by Chris M. Allport, audiences world-wide will now be able to experience this timeless romance in full HD video.
