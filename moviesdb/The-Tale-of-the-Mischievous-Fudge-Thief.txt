The Tale of the Mischievous Fudge Thief

 There lives a small Rat with a big dream. Unlike any rat before him, this Rat aspires to be human. When Rat comes upon a quaint little town called, Fudgeville, 'where everyone's happy,' he knows that this is the place for him. The townsfolk of Fudgeville have one word on their lips - 'fudge.' When a talking, singing, hat-wearing Rat walks into Mr Connigan's Fudge Shop, the townsfolk do not take to him kindly. Feeling rejected and not wanting to dismiss his dream, Rat concocts an extravagant, fool proof plan that only a rat could formulate. The Tale of the Mischievous Fudge Thief is a heart-warming, fun musical about a small Rat who, on his ambitious journey, discovers more about himself than he ever anticipated.
