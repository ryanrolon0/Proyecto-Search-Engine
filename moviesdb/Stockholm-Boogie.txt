Stockholm Boogie

 Jerka is on a break with his girlfriend Terrorese. They have been together for five years but Jerka need to make up his confused mind. His cousin and best friend Hoffe is dragging Jerka out for some good time to celebrate Jerka's freedom. Terrorese didn't accept the whole break thing and is now out looking for Jerka to try to solve their problems. On their way the two cousins manage to pick up the blonde beauty Nathalie. On foot the three of them wander around in the summer night, looking for the action. All that with the jealous and freaked out Terrorese closely behind them.
