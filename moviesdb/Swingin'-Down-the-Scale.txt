Swingin' Down the Scale

 A slight wisp of a story---fictional---about a jam session in an apartment and the landlord who doesn't appreciate the noise, but the music provided by Alvino Rey and His Orchestra, and the singing of The King Sisters (Alyce, Louise, Donna and Yvonne) is good. The music opens with "Should I Reveal", and between landlord interruptions, goes on to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," "Whispering," "Farewell Blues" and concludes with "Isle of Capri."
