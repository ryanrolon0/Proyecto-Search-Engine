The Watermelon Patch

 Several men slip into a watermelon patch, intending to carry some of them off. They are surprised and pursued by two other men who had been hiding, but they still manage to get several melons. Soon the men and their families are enjoying themselves, but meanwhile others are trying to trace the missing watermelons.
