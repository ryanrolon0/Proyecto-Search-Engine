 Two lazy friends find a job as ice-cream vendors to pay their back rent. When they start giving ice-cream to poor children for free, their boss, incensed, chases them off, and they take refuge in a nightclub, where they disguise themselves as female dancers. One misunderstanding follows another, until the impresario seeks them out, offering them a job as a comedy routine.
