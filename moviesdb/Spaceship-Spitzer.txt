Spaceship Spitzer

 Amy Okuda flies to Saturn to observe a new giant ring around the planet the largest ring ever discovered in our Solar System, but one that was only recently revealed through infrared observations by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in 2009. While there, she and Irwin (voiced by Wil Wheaton) encounter an old enemy, and must defeat their sinister plot. Ed Wasser also stars.
