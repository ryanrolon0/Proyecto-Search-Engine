So You Want to Know Your Relatives

 Joe McDoakes is a good-hearted soul, loved and respected by all and the president of the Good-Doers club. As such, he is selected to be the guest on the "Know Your Relatives" radio program. From his past comes an uncle who is an ex-con and reminds Joe of his reform school days; Joe's first wife, a follies dancer; an uncle who tells of the money Joe stole from him; a cousin who talks about Joe's war-time cowardice; and his mother and father make an appearance, straight from the poor-house.
