Space Chase

 'Space Chase' is a fast-paced short film from Catsnake Studios. Our hero and heroine become locked in a frantic race using elements of Parkour to reach their goal. Parkour, or 'Free-running', as seen on Channel 4's 'Jump London', is an increasingly popular pastime which involves using obstacles to perform jumps and acrobatics whilst continually running forwards An incredible team of film and television professionals have been brought together to work on this project, including those more used to working on large Hollywood blockbusters. Our team is further enhanced by the involvement of some of the world's best 'Free Runners'.
