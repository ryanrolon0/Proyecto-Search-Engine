Star Trak

 The Starship Enterprise is called to assist the Turds on the planet Uranus. Once inside the planet's flatulating force field, the Starship is pulled through the stench toward the crack in Uranus where a sphincter will crush it. Mr. Spock prepares a preparation HP, which, without time to test it, Captain Kirk orders be shot into Uranus. Will Spock's concoction shrink the planet's tracteroids and save the Starship?
