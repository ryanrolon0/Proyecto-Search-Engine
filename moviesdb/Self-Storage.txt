Self-Storage

 A love story of jazz standards set in a New York City self-storage facility. SOPHIE gives up her hope of becoming a jazz singer and puts her piano into self-storage. There, she meets HARRY, a down-on-his luck jazz pianist. Suddenly all their dreams feel possible again...until reality intrudes.
