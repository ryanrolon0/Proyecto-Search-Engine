The Texas Streak

 Chad Pennington, a movie-cowboy from Hollywood, gets into trouble when he poses as a two-gun outlaw from Texas named Tommy Hawk. He gets himself involved in a dispute between a development company and the local ranchers who don't want their ranches 'developed.' He falls in love with Molly Hollis, a rancher's daughter, and sides with the good guys, although his swaggering about town in a pair of sheep-skin chaps does little to impress anybody.
