The Gray Seasons

 Saint Louis University women's basketball is a longstanding Division I program with a lack of tradition and success. Despite the seemingly insurmountable odds of overcoming the losing culture of the program, Shimmy Gray-Miller, a young, dynamic coach with a personal history of playing and coaching success, is brought in to turn things around. She embarks on her first head-coaching position and is armed with her first class of determined recruits. Driven to change the trajectory of the basketball program, the team sets their sights on success, attempting to pull SLU from its last place conference standings to a conference contender. After a promising start, the challenges of being part of a demanding D-I program in a competitive conference begin to afflict the seasons. Injuries set in and loyalties are questioned as Coach Gray-Miller and the remaining players maintain drive and grit through the 4 years of triumphs and struggles of collegiate basketball.
