The Red Man's View

 The story of a tribe in the mid 1800's during the Civil War that is a small obscure tribe, which is a branch of the Shoshone. For thousands of years they inhabited a peaceful and beautiful immense valley with huge trees and giant waterfalls. The tribe consists of a very old Chief, the leader of the Shoshone branch tribe, his son Silver Eagle, and his son's betrothed Minewanna, the most beautiful female of the entire tribe, along with a hundred or so others. Now during this (Native American) "Indian" relocation period, Union squatters and the Union government are taking away all of the tribal lands. This tribe is eventually displaced from their peaceful valley by US Union soldiers, and their native land taken from them. They move on to another area, but again are displaced and forced to move again, this time by Union squatters. Among the white men, there is a stranger who is not part of the squatters, and this is when the day of reckoning comes.
