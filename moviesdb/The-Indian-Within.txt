The Indian Within

 Based on historical events, The Indian Within follows the story of a young man's struggle to maintain his indigenous identity as his own father strives to save him from the inevitable fate of abuse and subjugation. Challenging both Native and non-Native people to take a closer look at the indigenous issues of modern day, by providing a look into the past from the perspective of boarding school survivors. Language and cultural identity were violently stripped from multiple generations of native people by mainstream ideologies.
