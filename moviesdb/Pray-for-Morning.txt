Pray for Morning

 The plan was to spend one night in the abandoned Royal Crescent Hotel, where in 1985, five students were murdered, their killer never found. What was supposed to be just a night of fun, hunting for the victims' bloodstained rooms, suddenly changes when they find a severed hand and awake an evil presence within the hotel. Now they are running for their lives, trying to solve a mystery one hundred years old-and morning is still very far away.
