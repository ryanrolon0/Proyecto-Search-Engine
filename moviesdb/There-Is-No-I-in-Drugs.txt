There Is No I in Drugs

 Candice and Sherry are two single modern day Sex & The City styled women who find themselves sick on a Saturday night.

Unable, of course, to stay in on a Saturday 'to what take care of themselves?' they see two dogs with cones around their heads and come up with a solution.
