Retrovisor

 Sidney, 10 years old, washes windshields on the streets to help his dad, a garbage hunter. One day, after a couple fought at the traffic lights, Sidney finds a roll of film that fell from the guy's backpack, a photographer. Sidney fantasizes about the images in the film and tries to develop prints. The photographer misses the roll of film that is lacking to piece together his material about child labor.
