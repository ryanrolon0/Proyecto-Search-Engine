SacrE Bleu Cross

 Inspector Clouseau and Sergeant Deux-Deux track a notorious criminal, Hassan the Assassin, to a run-down building, where Clouseau must gain access to apprehend Hassan. Deux-Deux gives Clouseau a rabbit's foot for luck. It turns out that the only luck the rabbit's foot brings is luck of the bad variety, which Clouseau discovers in each of his painfully misbegotten attempts to enter Hassan's hideaway.
