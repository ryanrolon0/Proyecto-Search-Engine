Sunchasers

 SUNCHASERS will document the U.S. Paralympic Cycling Team as it participates in the 2008 Beijing Paralympics along with 4,000 other disabled athletes from over 150 countries this September. The Paralympics is the second largest gathering of athletes in the world, after the Olympics. Through the director's exceptional access to the team, the audience will experience along with them, their triumphs, struggles, and failures. Sunchasers demonstrates how these cyclists balance their grueling training regimens with "everyday" life. We will explore why these athletes make the sacrifices to become world-class and fight to compete in a sport with little sponsorship and no fame. Sunchasers is a story that documents the transcendence of the body in a sport that is preoccupied with distance, not boundaries.
