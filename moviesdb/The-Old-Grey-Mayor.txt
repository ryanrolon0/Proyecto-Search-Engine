The Old Grey Mayor

 Bob Hope loves Gwennie McGill, and wants to marry her. That won't happen if Alderman Tom Mulligan has his say as he also loves her and wants to marry her. But an even larger hurdle for Bob and Gwennie getting married is her father, A.K. McGill, who also wants Gwennie to marry Tom. Gwennie's father has a few connections at city hall to be able to stop Bob and Gwennie from marrying as he's the mayor. Bob and Gwennie do whatever they can to overcome the mayor's plans. But everything may fall apart for Bob and Gwennie all because of a few exploding cigars.
