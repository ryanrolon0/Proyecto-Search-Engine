Rhumba Land

 A Universal-musical short headlining Wini Shaw, who sings two numbers in her intriguingly throaty voice, including "The Lady in Red." Vivien Fay does a dance turn, as does comic-dancer Jimmy Clemons. Darryl Harpa (spelled correctly) and his Orchestra provide the music for all the numbers, including a Rhumba-dance exhibition by the ball-room team of The Theodores, and Alfredo Seville & The Singing Charros vocalize a number.
