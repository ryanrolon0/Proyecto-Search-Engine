Sone Pe Suhaaga

 Vijay Kumar is a well-off business industrialist who lives in Bombay in a palatial house. One day he returns home and finds out that his wallet has been stolen. Unknown to him, his wallet has ended up with a petty thief and pick-pocket named Vikram, who, in a drunken state, gives the wallet along with the money in it to a beggar woman named Usha Rani. Vijay does not know that this theft will turn his life upside down; re-unite him with his long-lost mother & brother; as well as put the lives of everyone he knows at risk at the hands of powerful gangster, Tejaa, who will leave no stone unturned to destroy Vijay and whoever comes in his way.
