Rain Is Falling

 In a time in which all borders of ethnic, religious and cultural differences are being questioned, RAIN IS FALLING makes a connection, takes a look into a foreign world and encourages a dialogue between the worlds of strangers. RAIN IS FALLING tells the story of a solution, that comparatively abstracts the big in the small. One thing becomes clear devotedness and elementary relationship of love and humanity lifts up the most simple action to redemption. Intuitive images weave themselves into a poetic narrative structure. Slowness and atmosphere build up to a cinematic climax, that uncovers the small, the beauty of the simple and natural, that may bridge human as well as cultural gaps.
