Tomcat Combat

 Woody Woodpecker is engaged in combat with a big tomcat and after several break-even escapades, Woody finally tricks the cat into a dogcatcher's truck which is filled with dogs with a sour disposition, especially regarding cats. Woody finally shoots the cat off into outer space using a giant rocket (not from Acme.)
