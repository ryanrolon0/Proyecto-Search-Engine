The Unconquered

 A documentary on the amazing life of Helen Keller, in 1882, aged 19 months she fell ill with what was termed "brain fever" (now believed to be scarlet fever or meningitis) which left her deaf and blind, made when she was 74 years old. Her background and early years are covered by newsreel clips and stills, while the camera follows her on her normal, everyday activities and workaday routine of visits, missions and social activities. The narration is spoken by Katharine Cornell, while a special sequence with U.S.A. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was shot for this production by director-writer-composer-producer Nancy Hamilton (I), one of the true triple-threat pioneer film-women of the time. This theatrical-distributed film was slightly revised and updated and shown on television in 1955 as Helen Keller
