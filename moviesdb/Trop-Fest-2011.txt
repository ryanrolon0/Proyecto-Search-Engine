Trop Fest 2011

 Middle aged Sydney based rocker is interviewed about his experiences on the rock scene. As the film develops it his narcissistic side becomes more apparent as he relives his former glory days in flashbacks. The movie itself makes light of the current Australian independent rock scene.
