Tamed

 It's ten years after their marriage, and Kate and Petruchio are still at each others' throats. In this modern take on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, a peek into the sharp-tongued lovers' bedroom reveals Kate trying to spice up what has become their stale, predictable sex life. Meanwhile Petruchio, gamely attempting to please his over-the-top wife, confesses that all he really wants to do is brush his teeth and climb under the covers.
