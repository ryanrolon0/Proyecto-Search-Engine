Shin shin to

 In this city, winter lasts over half a year and it snows more than 6 meters every year. At night the darkness is illuminated by 3.7 million glistening lights, and lovers huddle together in front of them. However, there is a rumor about it- lovers who see this illumination together would go their separate ways. Yoko and Takanori are no exception. Their relationship is changing day by day. One day she realizes his answer in his silence. Sadness is inscribed into her heart, and into the place. Memories of lost love crystallize in the sky, and fall to the ground. So in this city, memories are falling as snow.
