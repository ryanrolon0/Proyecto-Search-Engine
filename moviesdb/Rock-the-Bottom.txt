Rock the Bottom

 Rock the Bottom is the story of 6 women trying to achieve their dream of being a skateboarder in the male dominated industry. Victory over gender oppression never felt so timely, raw, and gritty as we follow their intimate and tumultuous criss-crossing lives; breaking legs, hearts and banks, eking out a space on the podium.
