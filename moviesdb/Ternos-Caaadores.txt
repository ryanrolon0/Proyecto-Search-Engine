Ternos Caaadores

 A family of four people (parents and two children, one of them still a kid) live by the sea. The father studies the migratory flights of birds. One day, there appears an escaped prisoner on the shore, trapped just like one of the lost birds. The film depicts their acquaintance and the ensuing tragedy.
