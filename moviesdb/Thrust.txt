Thrust

 A comedy where 3 misfit filmmakers ready to call it quits get one last chance to impress Hollywood and must finish their incredibly obnoxious and perverted TV show about the pimped-out car scene before the cast kills each other, the money runs out and their dreams are doomed forever. Ultimately its about believing in yourself when other people don't.
