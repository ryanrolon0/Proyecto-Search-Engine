The Last Audition

 An indie short film about the commercialization of film. In the final days of the studio, nobody in the business cares about art; it is only the matter of whether a film will sell or not. In the last audition of the final production of the studio, a film star, Natalie, makes her appearance. The director immediately takes interest in her because she will appeal to the audience; however, the casting director wants to find something else inside her, to see if she can adapt to a style that's different of who she is...
