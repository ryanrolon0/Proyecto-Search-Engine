 Shout it Out is an original musical based on the lives of Vermont teens. The film is an adaptation of the groundbreaking original stage musical The Voices Project that toured to thirteen towns across Vermont in 2005 and was based on writings by Vermont teenagers with original music by teens. The stories and characters were developed during an intensive, yearlong statewide research phase in which more than 1000 teens participated.
