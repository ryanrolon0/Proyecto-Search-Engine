The King Chronicle, Part 1

 Canadian Prime Minister W.L. Mackenzie King's childhood and early career are chronicled. Believing he is a child of destiny, drawn to greatness by "an unseen hand," King begins the meteoric rise to power in the civil service and later in the Liberal Party of Canada. By the end of this episode, however, his political future appears uncertain.
