The Wind Fisherman

 The Wind Fisherman lives in the windiest town in the world where he 'fishes' for things that have blown away and returns them to their rightful owners. His father, grand-father, great grand-father, and even great great grand-father before him were all Wind Fishermen but even though it is in his blood, it is not in his heart, at least not until he learns one of life's most valuable lessons.
