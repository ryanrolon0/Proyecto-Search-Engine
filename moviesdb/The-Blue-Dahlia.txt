The Blue Dahlia

 When Johnny comes home from the navy he finds his wife Helen kissing her substitute boyfriend Eddie, the owner of the Blue Dahlia nightclub. Helen admits her drunkenness caused their son's death. He pulls a gun on her but decides she's not worth it. Later, Helen is found dead and Johnny is the prime suspect. Ex-bomber pilot Johnny Morrison and his buddies George and Buzz (who, with a metal plate in his head, can't stand "monkey music"), return from the war to their home town, Hollywood. In a rude homecoming, Johnny finds his wife Helen behaving like a tramp with oily nightclub owner Eddie Harwood. His marriage over, Johnny wanders off into the night, leaving his gun behind...and someone uses it to murder Helen. Dodging cops and seeking the real killer, Johnny is aided by blonde Joyce, who just happens to be the estranged wife of Eddie Harwood... When Lt. Commander Johnny Morrison returns home during World War II he finds that his wife Helen has been less than faithful to him. She been seeing Eddie Harwood and generally living a happy-go-lucky life. When she's found shot in the hotel bungalow where she lived, Johnny becomes the primary suspect. He's soon on the run, assisted by Eddie's wife, Jessica Harwood. Morrison maintains his innocence and seems to be off the hook when his wartime buddy Buzz, who loses his memory from time to time, confesses. Morrison doesn't believe it for one minute and sets out to find the real killer.
