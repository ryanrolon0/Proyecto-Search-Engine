The Man Hunters

 The entire police force is out to capture an escaped convict and win the $500 reward, but that is easier said than done. The convict makes himself at home in the police station and bobs up in other unexpected quarters, until finally he is captured by a spinster, who, having won the reward, becomes the police chief's bride.
