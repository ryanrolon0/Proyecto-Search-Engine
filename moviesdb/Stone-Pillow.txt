Stone Pillow

 Florabelle befriends a naive young college graduate working at a homeless shelter to learn about the homeless. Taking her into the streets, she teaches her about survival including rubbing vinegar on her feet to toughen them. The main difference between the women is that the college student gets to return home after her experience.
