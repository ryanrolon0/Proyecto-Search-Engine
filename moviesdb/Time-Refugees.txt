Time Refugees

 In the year 2110 a small group of space travelers have left the war-ravaged Earth behind. After transporting themselves through space and time, they approach what they think is Earth....or is it? Soon they will find out a truth they are not ready to confront, a truth that will bond them to change the fate of humanity, a truth that will turn them into "Time Refugees."
