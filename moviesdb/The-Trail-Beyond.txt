The Trail Beyond

 Rod Drew has been sent to find a missing miner and his daughter. He is joined by old friend Wabi whom he has to rescue from card cheats that framed him for murder. Later they find a skeleton and a map to a mine. When they put the map into a safe, a LaRocque henchman sees them. LaRocque wants the map and captures the Mountie sent to get Wabi. His man then dressed as the Mountie captures Rod and Wabi. In timber country with a snowy mountain backdrop, Rod Drew saves college pal Wabi from cardsharps on a train. He finds two skeletons in a shack and a map leading to a gold mine. Others want that mine as well.
