The Awakening

 A man wakes up and plunges into his monotony, day after day. Neither his daydreams nor his real life offer an image of fulfillment But everything changes when he increases his focus on his senses. Through his story, it is our lives that are reinvented, second after second, piece after piece, drop after drop.
