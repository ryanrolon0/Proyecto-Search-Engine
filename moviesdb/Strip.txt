Strip

 A playful rave trance riff on experimental animation fabricated without animation. STRIP utilizes painting trimmings and mobilizes them in a skewed homage to the fanciful worlds of early Hans Richter, Oscar Fischinger, Musique Concrete, and 60's Color Field painting. The Static is sent packing in a frenzy of temporal excess and repetition accompanied by the sounds of its own launch.
