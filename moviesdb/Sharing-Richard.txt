Sharing Richard

 J.C., Bonnie, and Roz are good friends. They have been lamenting on how difficult it is to find a good man or that there isn't a good one out there. And before you know they each meet the perfect man; too bad it's the same one, Richard Burknowski, a doctor, who met each of them separately, J.C. who's lawyer, to handle his divorce, Bonnie, a realtor, to find him a new place to live, and Roz, who's a little vain, for a nose job. While he is unaware of their relationship, they aware of him, decide to date him at the same time, each taking turns. But what happens when one of them wants a commitment, will the other two ste aside?
