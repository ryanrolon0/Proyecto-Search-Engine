The Delaware Project

 The Delaware Project centers around a young woman's fledgling sense of connection in a landscape that is undergoing rapid development. A precarious highway carries her to a series of doctors' appointments, where it is unclear what ails her. She speaks to no one and expresses nothing. More a tone poem than a traditional narrative, this film defies linear convention in an attempt to show the unceremonious demise of person and place.
