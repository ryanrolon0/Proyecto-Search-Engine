Two Tickets to Paris

 In this musical, fairly light movie, two young people, Joey and Piper are in love. They embark on a cruise to Paris to get married, with the acerbic but kind Aggie as a chaperon. Along the way, their sweet innocent romance runs into trouble when Coco, a french dancer uses Joey to make her straying boyfriend jealous.
