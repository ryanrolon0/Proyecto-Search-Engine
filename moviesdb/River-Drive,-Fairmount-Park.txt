River Drive, Fairmount Park

 This film shows one of the prettiest pieces of the famous Park Drive, north of the Girard Avenue Bridge. A number of wagons are seen emerging from the natural tunnel, and the picture ends with a boy on a wheel, who forgets where he is for a moment and spills himself all over the road. He rises hastily and pedals away for all he is worth. A most interesting and brilliant subject.
