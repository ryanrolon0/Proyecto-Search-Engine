Sleepover Nightmare

 A couple of friends party wildly at a vacation house. While they're drinking and having the time of their lives, an escaped mental patient stalks the party, killing anyone who parts from the gang. As the night falls, the remaining partyers find themselves trapped inside the house with a mad serial killer outside, just waiting to kill the rest of them off.
