Tza'ad Katan

 Sahar is a 14-year old teenager, who tries to contend with his obstacles in life, while watching the disintegrating relationship between his two parents, experiencing groping love with his sensitive neighbour, Michal. Sahar's friend, Eyal, starts to suffer from lymphatic-cancer and is evacuated to hospital admission. In addition, small-sized and energetic Duba, the leader of the group, decides to fullfil Eyal's dream and set a girl for him in case he dies, so he won't die a virgin. Along with another friend, Noam, they are going through an amusing, although very sensitive experience while learning about life, love and honesty.
