Virtual Oz

 Prince Otto has no friends, so he decides to force the Oz Kids into a virtual reality computer game presented to them at Scraps's baby shower. Unfortunately, the patchwork baby gets into the game and overflows the number of players, trapping them in a deteriorating program from which they have little chance of escape. Otto had no wish to actually harm them, and must try to get them out.
