Shhh

 'Shhh' is a film made with no movie camera, no budget, no stars and no dialogue. You may wonder if there's anything there to see at all, but 'Shhh' delivers four minutes of still images and intricate sound design that harks back to the great dialogue-free comedies of the past. The story of two men trying to uncover the source of mysterious humming noises in the walls of their apartment, 'Shhh' is a simple idea that builds to a crescendo of slapstick destruction, electric shocks, slashed sofas and suspect spaghetti.
