Presenza

 Italian Canadians friends. But the roots of their communities lie with the people who one day decided to leave the places where they were born and raised - the immigrants. They came mainly from rural Italy, and brought traditions and values to a society that was quite different from their own. Their outlook, way of life, knowledge and know-how are now an integral part of the Canadian fabric. Presenza looks at the unique spirit, skills, crafts and traditions a generation of Italian immigrants brought to Canada that helped shape the Canadian landscape. From early explorers to the modern day entrepreneurs, Presenza examines a cross section of Italian society that is filled with a joyful love of life and a spirited sense of community.
