Sunday Dreamer

 A young man is offered the opportunity of a lifetime when he is cast as the young and attractive Elvis Presley for the highly anticipated CBS network mini-series in 2005. But that young man, Ashley Clark, turns down the role immediately before filming begins. He leaves a trail of people behind baffled and confused. But Ashley decides to step into a different role...that of a preacher. He plans to journey alongside his tent revival-preaching father. And it is after he makes this decision to preach instead of act that he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that Ashley himself had never expected.
