Terrestrial Extras

 Screenwriter Jim O'Connell takes us on a journey unlike any other, when he leads us along the path of extraterrestrial encounters that have guided his life. This life path is strewn with sightings, close encounters, synchronicities, miraculous connections and total mysteries. Sharing Jim's alien excursion is wife Terry who has become a witness to Jim's otherworldly odyssey. Her memories paint a broader picture of the alien experiences when coupled with Jim's post contact visions. Unlike all other alien encounter stories, this tale is one of wonder, amazement, miracle and mystery that include family, friends and sometimes even unwitting strangers. Twisting this strange life story further are the extraterrestrial messages that seem to blur the lines between angels and aliens and have Jim and Terry rethinking all they believe to be true. These stories build a framework that supports the idea that many people involved in alien contact are playing a small role in the background of everyday life to help introduce the world to our brothers from the stars. Those people are the TERRESTRIAL EXTRAS.
