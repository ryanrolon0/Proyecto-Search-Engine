W bialy dzien

 Set in 1905. The story focuses on a young and inexperienced man in a revolutionary execution squad. He does his killing job out of idealism, and for the love of a woman. The young student murders a Russian spy and is afterwards arrested by the police. Much to his surprise he is released after a session with the traitor-judge, hinting at some leaks in the organization. Student reports his suspicions back to the organization, but in response is given a new hit mission, aimed at a Polish writer believed to be collaborating with the Russians. The killer comes to Cracow where the writer lives and comes to a conclusion that perhaps the writer is innocent, since there is no conclusive evidence.
