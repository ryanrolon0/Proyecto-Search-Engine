Queen City

 Set in gritty, rust belt Buffalo circa 1980, Queen City follows the struggle of two detectives from both sides of the tracks and a jazz singer trapped in a world of political corruption, urban decay and social dystopia. Recreating iconic jazz clubs of the time, Queen City comes alive on screen through music by capturing the joy and sorrow of a weathered city and the strain on personal morality.
