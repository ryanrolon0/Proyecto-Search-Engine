The Idealist

 A modern day Robin Hood who rides a Vespa instead of a horse, The Idealist is a hilarious slap in society's face. With a girlfriend who is skeptical of his actions and a couple of drug dealers who only care about the weed, The Idealist has to take troubles into his own hands. Pollution upsets him, hunger pisses him off and homelessness infuriates him. Can one man and his Vespa make a difference or are we all doomed to drive SUVs and eat from the Ninety-nine cent menu?
