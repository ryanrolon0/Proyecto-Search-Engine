Radio City Revels

 Washed-up songwriter Harry Miller and his neighbor, dancer Billie Shaw, are insolvent despite efforts to find work in radio. But Harry is visited by his "student," hillbilly Lester Robin, who can only write songs in his dreams. And lo! Lester's first nap yields a song hit for which Harry takes credit. But to fulfill his new contract, he needs to keep Lester sleeping, amidst romantic complications. Lester Robin, a songwriter, and Billie Shaw, an aspiring dancer, are striving to make good at Radio City , where Kenny Baker is already a star network singer. Also hanging around the premises are Harry Miller and Teddy Jordan, a Tin Pan Alley song-writing team who write songs for Radio City bosses Paul Plummer and Crane. Lester, an Arkansas show-boat performer, in his sleep composes songs which are excellent, but he is unconscious of the fact and has gone to New York City to take lessons from Miller and Jordan. Alas, Miller has gone stale but he learns the secret of Lester's sleep-time gift, and proceeds to copy the songs and market them as his own; his object being to finance the career of Miss Shaw, although she is in love with Baker. But through the success of Lester's songs that have been appropriated by Miller, she gets a dancing engagement, and her sister Gertie Shaw becomes romantically attached to Lester. Then Lester develops insomnia, and can't compose anymore since he isn't sleeping. HOWEVER...back in Arkansas, copies of his songs he produced in his sleep are discovered, with no mention of who was writing them down for him in Arkansas. Dancers Squenchy and Lisa carry them to New York where Miller capitalizes upon them in a big way.
