RKO Pathe Sportscope

 Spring training has ended and the baseball pennant chase, in the National League, is already under way in St. Louis, Chicago and Brooklyn. The use of slow-motion cameras gives shots of baseball plays not usually revealed at the regular 35 mm camera speed. 1940 baseball players seen close-up and in action include 'Dizzy" Dean, Carl Hubbell, "Arky" Vaughan, "Gabby" Hartnett, Joe Medwick, Merrill May and Ernie Lombardi.
