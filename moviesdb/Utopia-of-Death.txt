Utopia of Death

 This short is a report of an expedition, led by Harold Austin, to Mexico's Tiburón Island in the Gulf of California. Austin was in search of the Seri Indians, who were believed to be a dying people when this film was made. We see several Seri natives carrying on their daily lives as they have for many centuries. Concern for the Seris' survival has proved to be premature.
