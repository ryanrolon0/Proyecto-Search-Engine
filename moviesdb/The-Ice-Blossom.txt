The Ice Blossom

 After coming to terms with the downfall of his last relationship, Monroe thinks he is ready to move on. His best friend, Josh, thinks otherwise. Monroe has had his eyes on one girl in mind, Chelsea. While Josh sees this as a bad idea, being she is already pregnant with an ex-boyfriend's baby, Monroe ignores his advice and asks her out. Chelsea seeing the sort of nerdy, insecure Monroe endearing, she pushes her own insecurities aside and says yes. While on their first date, things are going well until Monroe receives a devastating phone call, his grandfather has just died of a stroke and he must travel to Elgin, North Dakota to attend the funeral. On the drive to Chelsea's apartment, she offers to accompany the clearly crushed Monroe for the road trip. She thinks she might be able to make the long trip through the dead of winter, just a little more tolerable. As Chelsea tries to comfort Monroe through his difficult journey, she begins to reveal more of her own past heartaches, things she hoped she would never talk about again. Throughout the trip they begin to learn more and understand each other better, but before they get to their destination, fate will test them in events they never could have imagined.
