Under the Mistletoe

 Devoted father and husband, Tom Chandler dies, in a car accident, but appears as a ghost to his teenage son Jonathan. Now single mother, Susan Chandler tries to concentrate on her reporter job and dismisses dad's ghost, but allows the school counselor, Kevin Harrison, to work with Jonathan. Dad and Jonathan arrange for Susan to enter a radio show's dating game, and conclude that only Kevin, a widower and coach in Jonathan's former favorite sport ice-hockey, will do as his step-dad, while she leans towards lawyer Greg Roberts.
