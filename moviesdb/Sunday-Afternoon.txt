Sunday Afternoon

 Two lovers rendezvous on a Sunday afternoon in front of the penguins at the San Francisco zoo. Their greeting is awkward; there are nervous pauses, questions, evasions then blatant lies; finally, the truth comes out. Then there's shock, hurt, anger, barbs, and last words. Although the gestures, facial expressions, and tones of voice are real, the words the men speak are actually subtexts answer." "Confusion - slightly suspicious." The ritual of animal behavior is on display.
