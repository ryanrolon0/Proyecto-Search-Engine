The Hand Job

 Steven and Ben are slackers, but are hyper-competitive when it comes to beating each other. When their boss, Mike Hand, unexpectedly quits, Steven and Ben become the unlikely frontrunners for "the Hand job," a promotion neither of them wants. But if one of them is promoted, it would mean that one best friend would be working for the other. Fearing that, their competitive natures set off a crude, no-holds barred fight to the finish in which no co-worker, senior citizen, pet rodent or deli sandwich is spared.
