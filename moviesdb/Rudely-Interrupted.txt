Rudely Interrupted

 A rock-documentary with a difference, Rudely Interrupted follows a band of disabled individuals on their first world tour. As well as the usual challenges of touring, this band has to contend with aspergers, down syndrome, blindness and deafness. But this doesn't stop them from rocking out. The documentary of the same name follows Rudely Interrupted from the pub stages of Melbourne, to the UN in New York, Canada and the UK.
