Son of the Invisible Man

 Life seems perfect for Harold and Nancy, a young couple living in 1950s suburbia, with their first child on the way. However, Harold harbors a dark family secret Harold does his best to keep Nancy in the dark, while hiding his invisible father, who drops in for a visit. However, once the baby is born, it's plain to see (well, sort of) that Harold's problems have only just begun. Faced with peculiar challenges every day, Harold soon comes to realize that there is often much more to raising a child than meets the eye.
