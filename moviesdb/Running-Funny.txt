Running Funny

 Michael and Eddie are two broke college graduates who rent an 'apartment garage' from Stan, a blind old war veteran, and begin their tumultuous transition into the real world. Over the course of 30 days Michael realizes he has more in common with Stan than he does with his best friend. While Eddie is desperate to find a 'real' job and get as far away from his parents as possible, Michael wishes he could go back to the house he grew up in before his parents died. Starring Tony nominated actor Louis Zorich along with newcomers Maximilian Osinski and Gene Gallerano, Running Funny is a story about a transition we all make, one in which accepting the inevitable changes in life means you have to stop running to move ahead.
