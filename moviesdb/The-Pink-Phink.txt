The Pink Phink

 The Pink Panther, walking inside a building, sees a little man painting a wall blue and thinks that pink would be more appropriate. So, the Pink Panther obtains a bucket of pink paint and begins painting the wall with his preferred color. The hot-tempered man doesn't at first realize that his work is being painted over by the panther, but when he does, he grabs a rifle and shoots at the pink cat. The Pink Panther pours his pink paint into the man's rifle, and with each shot that the man fires, gobs of pink paint splatter on the building, turning it entirely pink! And so, the Pink Panther graciously decides to become the building's new occupant. A house painter has an ordinary job to do the outside becomes out of the ordinary, and downright surreal, when his blue paint seems to be turning pink. Is something wrong with the paint? Is something wrong with his mind? He doesn't notice that the trouble really lies elsewhere look so much better than blue. And so the panther goes about painting over the house painter's work, sometimes only a moment after the painter has done it. The painter is half mad before he realizes what is really going on, and then he pulls out a gun to shoot this feline nemesis. Too bad the Pink Panther finds a way to fill the gun with pink paint.
