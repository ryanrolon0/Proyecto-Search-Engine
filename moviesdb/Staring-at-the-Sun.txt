Staring at the Sun

 Staring at the Sun contemplates the parallels between our pursuit of God and our pursuit of romantic love and is modeled on the silent comedies of early cinema. The protagonist, William, is unsatisfied by his mundane life, and uses his imagination as a coping mechanism. When he comes upon a girl who seems to cope in a similar way, he becomes obsessed with watching her. Increasingly, his voyeurism is made more difficult, and he must devise new ways of watching her without being seen. Whether it is love or just fascination, he's determined to find out. The film is ideally screened with a live performance of the score and voice over to evoke the spirit of the silent film era.
