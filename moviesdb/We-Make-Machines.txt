We Make Machines

 Godfrey is shy. He hides behind his computer, behind his fake girlfriend, and mostly behind his life-sized robotic visual representation of himself, but then, so does everyone else. He lives in a world where mechanical BTRs (Better Than Reals) mediate every social interaction, so that people no longer have to interact with one another. In order to survive a double date filled with a series of malfunctions, both personal and mechanical, Godfrey must stop hiding, put down his controller, and reach out.
