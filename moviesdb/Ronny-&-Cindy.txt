Ronny & Cindy

 Ronny, a dramatically self-centered and over self-indulgent yuppie, makes a stupid joke to his Cindy, a liberated XXIst executive woman type. No matter what Ronny will try for the sake of reconquering his love now only grow stronger and stronger until the inevitable happens. Ronald & Cindy Rella are successful yuppies. They have been living together for eight years now. Today, while a general strike is building political and social chaos in Canada, Cindy doesn't want to laugh at Ronald's childish jokes anymore. He incarnated all she was looking for in a perfect man. She now understands, as a general strike brings to light the every day difficulties of every single citizens and workers, that the life she has been sharing with Ronny is completely meaningless, because disconnected from the reality a majority of people's everyday life. Ronny makes THE mistake line he should not have crossed. Ronny, dramatically self-centered and over self-indulgent, doesn't apologize and tries to reconquer his love by cooking a romantic dinner. Unfortunately, it's already too late. The hate will now only grow stronger and stronger until the inevitable happens. Chaos from outside turned love, supposedly indestructible, into a battlefield.
