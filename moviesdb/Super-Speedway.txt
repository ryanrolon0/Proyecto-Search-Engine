Super Speedway

 We follow the Newman-Haas (Andretti) racing team through the process of building, testing, and racing for a season. This includes extensive race speed on-track footage, including some pre-race footage with a full squad of cars. From time to time, we check in with a small shop building/restoring one of the first roadsters 'Mario Andretti' (qv) raced; the finale includes him taking it for a spin.
