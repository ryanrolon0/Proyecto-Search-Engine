Thirty Below Zero

 It's Christmas eve in the Connecticut suburbs, probably the coldest Christmas on record. Sounds of lovemaking come from her mother's bedroom as teen Lucy heads downstairs to the kitchen, past the living room where the tree is lit and well-wrapped presents are beneath. As Lucy goes outside, her little brother John comes downstairs wearing a football helmet. He sits beneath the tree and starts opening presents. Mom awakes after 7 and wants to hurry her lover out of bed and to the train station before her children see him. He's petulant. She heads for the kitchen to find the car keys. The car radio is playing "O Holy Night" and "Ave Maria." Can mom move fast enough?
