Starship Troopers 2

 We are sent back to the battlefield, as the Federation's best Mobile Infantry unit are slowly being overpowered by the killer bugs. They are light years from the nearest reinforcements and are trapped on a remote outpost. They set up protection around the post, keeping all the bugs waiting for them to leave. But now the enemy is in the outpost, in a way which they would have never thought of. Starship Troopers 2 is an indirect sequel to the original Starship Troopers that went straight to video. Had it not featured the same bugs and the same helmets from the first Starship Troopers, you wouldn't be able to tell that this was even in the same universe. The focus of the movie was on a single event, that showed a sort of evolution of the war between the bugs and humans in the Starship Troopers universe. The particular event showed its significance because the bugs the humans were fighting against were using smaller bugs that took control of humans, inhabiting their brain, being able to spread like a virus from one to the other until there are no more humans left. After a violent combat against the bugs in their planet, with many casualties of humans under the command of a coward officer, a group of troopers looks for shelter in an abandoned military post. The psychic Pvt. Lei Sahara finds and releases Capt. V.J. Dax, who was left behind locked in a cell by his troop, after killing a general. Dax and two privates, in a daring mission, save Gen. J. G. Shepherd and some soldiers from an attack of the bugs, and Shepherd gives him a command position. While waiting for rescue, some troopers are invaded through their mouths by small bugs that took control of their brains. When Gen. Shepherd is possessed by one creature, Dax and Sahara try to prevent him getting back to the Federation.
