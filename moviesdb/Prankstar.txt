Prankstar

 Two student filmmakers get more than they bargained for when they decide to follow comedian Tom Green on a road trip across Canada. Beginning in Hollywood, the crew documents Tom withstanding a barrage of insults, shallow hangers-on, and the loneliness of waning fame. Broken, Tom returns to his hometown of Ottawa to find things aren't much better. Friendless and growing more unstable by the minute, Tom is met with an uncaring public and fans who can't help but bring up his past. Things take a dark turn when a frightening series of events forces Tom and his film crew to flee from the law. What follows is equal parts madcap road trip and celebrity commentary.
