Tu Hi Meri Zindagi

 FREEDOM IS MY BIRTH RIGHT shouted one of the glorious sons of the motherland and he would not rest until he cut all the shackles of bondage. This was the spirit which inspired our hero who belonged to the masses.........FREEDOM IS MY BIRTH RIGHT shouted one of the glorious sons of the motherland and he would not rest until he cut all the shackles of bondage. This was the spirit which inspired our hero who belonged to the masses. Rocky, the last unsung patriot in the Gomes family which was well known for its tradition of having sacrificed everything for the cause of liberation of Goa, was unlike his ancestors because his grandmother, the only surviver of the family had very cautiously kept away Rocky from the influence of politics and revolutionary movement. But he was born to be the liberator of Goa and all circumstances worked up to provide him a field so that he could become immortal. The happy go lucky Rocky turned into a maniac when his love was frustrated with the death of his beloved Maria who fell a victim to Portuguese atrocities. Rocky avenged her death by killing Portuguese tyrants. Then by force of circumstances, Rocky was dragged into the revolutionary movement and he identified himself with the ideal of his country's freedom. Thus the found an opportunity and an altar to pour out all his suppressed attachment and love for his country providing his people a life of honor and grace. His sacrifices kindled a fire of freedom in each hear which was enough to burn down the malicious designs of those who do not honor the people right to be free to govern themselves.
