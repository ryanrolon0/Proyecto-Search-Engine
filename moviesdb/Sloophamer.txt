Sloophamer

 Dirk van den Berg and his wife Annie are startled when suddenly a demolition ball comes through the wall. Dirk should have left his home long ago, as the entire neighborhood will go down. But Dirk doesn't want to go, not when an entire unit of the Dutch special forces show up and not after he almost gets shot by bullets from sharpshooters. Dirk doesn't give up, especially not after groups of protesters turn up and he gets national news coverage. But what portion of these events is true? Dirk does suffer from an advanced form of dementia.
