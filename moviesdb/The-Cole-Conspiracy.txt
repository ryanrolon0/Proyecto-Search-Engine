The Cole Conspiracy

 The USS Cole pulled into port in Aden, Yemen on a sweltering morning, intending to re-fuel and then head on to patrol the Persian Gulf as a strong show of American presence there. According to the first-hand account of Navy fireman Raymond Mooney, who was keeping watch aboard the Cole as it re-fueled, a tiny boat with two men aboard came speeding toward the ship. The men smiled and waved to Mooney and he waved back and then came up to the side of the Cole and detonated explosives that blew of the ship. But the attack is only the beginning of the story...
