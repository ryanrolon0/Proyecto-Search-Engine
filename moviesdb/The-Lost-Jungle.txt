 Sharkey, animal handler for the Maitland Circus, is jealous of the success of star animal trainer Clyde Beatty - murderously so, as he has once surreptitiously permitted a hungry lion to be prematurely freed in a cage with Clyde, who escapes being mauled by the skin of his teeth.

When her father, a sea captain, prepares to set sail, he obliges Ruth to come with him if she cannot get an honorable marriage proposal from Clyde; and he is too busy thinking about his animals to notice what she is saying...
