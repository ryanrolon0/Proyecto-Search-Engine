Sucker Money

 Jimmy Reeves, a smart young newspaper reporter, saves a banker. John Walton, and his daughter, Claire, from ruin and disgrace and also wins the affections of the banker's daughter. Mr. Walton and Claire are induced to attend a sEance held by Swami Yomurda, a fake spiritualist, which is a redundant description. Impressed by the fake Swami's trickery, Walton almost loses his fortune and his daughter before the reporter exposes the bunko scheme.
