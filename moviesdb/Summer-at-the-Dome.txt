Summer at the Dome

 A documentary film telling the story of the 2010 Craig Cromwell League in Baltimore City. Hosted each year by the Madison Square Recreation Center (nicknamed 'The Dome') and funded by nearby Johns Hopkins Hospital, the league features the city's top high school basketball teams each summer. Run by former St. Frances coach William Wells, the league is now in it's 25th year and plays host to eight boys teams and six girls teams, including local powerhouses Dunbar and St. Frances.
