Supply & Demand

 Harrington is a by-the-rules cop, being groomed for command in the police force. Jake Brown is a street-wise cop, brilliant at undercover work in the drug trade. When chance throws Harrington an opportunity to break one of Manchester's biggest drug rings by going undercover himself, it's up to Jake to make sure that Harrington doesn't blow the case or their covers. But Harrington begins to discover more than he wanted to know about himself, and he may be in danger of going too far.
