 Thirteen-year-old Ismayil works for the most powerful drug dealer in the city of Lod; Daniel, a traumatized Israeli ex-soldier, often buys drugs from Ismayil, trying to escape his own reality. When Ismayil's little brother is hired to help him with a sell, he decides he's had enough, and in a frantic encounter deep in the city slums, Ismayil and Daniel find in each other a way out of their respective hells.
