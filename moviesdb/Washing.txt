Washing

 The Story of James; after his wife left him James became a depressed writer who can't find something new to write about. After he finds a pair of pink panties, he fantasies about he and a woman together again, making him more thoughtful about the way he is living, and finally write something again. A story supporting the adage 'Every action causes a reaction'
