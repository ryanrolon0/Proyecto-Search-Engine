The Poisoned Flume

 After the death of her husband, Mrs. Kendall found the management of the ranch, with its attendant responsibilities, a source of worry. Her daughter, recently returned from an Eastern boarding school, could not assist her and, although the cowboys in her employ were faithful, the ranch needed an executive head. John Morgan, a neighboring ranchman, had long cast envious eyes upon the widow's increasing herd of cattle, and desired to marry the daughter in order to obtain possession of her ranch. He offers to manage her affairs for her, but the widow distrusts him and refuses his offer. Mrs. Kendall finally secures the services of Jim Stevenson, a manly young cowboy, and he is introduced to the boys as the new manager. They take him out on the range that he may become better acquainted with his new duties. They encounter John Morgan, who is ordered off the range by the new manager. Morgan determines to force his attention on Hazel Kendall and hurries to the ranch house. He finds Hazel alone and attempts to kiss her when Jim, coming to the house to report, witnesses the struggle and rescues her from the distasteful caress. Mrs. Kendall orders Morgan to leave her premises and he goes away with hatred seething in his heart. He returns to his ranch and plans a most diabolical revenge.
