Simulacra

 A woman experiences a series of surreal yet beautiful situations in a dream, most of which incorporate a mysterious Stranger and a mirror box that holds abstract memories and sounds. The fear and anxiety the stranger causes upon her prompts an inner dialog and a reflection on solitude and the people in her life. The woman understands and sees herself, finally awaking within her dream.
