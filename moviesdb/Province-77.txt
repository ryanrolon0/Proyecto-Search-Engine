Province 77

 Thai Town is a six-block area near Hollywood, Los Angeles, which is home to over 50,000 expatriated Thais. The town is such a gateway for Thais entering America it was dubbed Thailand's 77th Province. The movie follows a Thai family as it struggles to survive in Los Angeles' fast-paced consumerist culture, while still maintaining traditional values. The identity struggle between Thai-ness and the high octane way of life on the west coast of America, defined by hip-hop, drugs, street racing and violence, affects Pat, a good boy tempted by a life of crime, and his sister.
