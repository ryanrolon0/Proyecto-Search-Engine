U Me Aur Hum

 The first time Ajay saw Pia, she served him drinks. She affected him more than the alcohol, and he found true love. He was a leading psychiatrist, but she messed up his mind. The first time Pia saw Ajay, he had too much to drink. She watched him make a fool of himself, and was relieved when he passed out. She was a woman who followed her heart, but despite his claims of true love, she had made up her mind. Thus began the story of Ajay and Pia. A love story, that begins at sea. Ajay and Pia develop a strong and special bond. In each other, they find an anchor. They rush into marriage, despite the advice and failing relationships of their friends. But no marriages can be complete without problems, and Ajay and Pia have also have to face hurdles, some of which seem insurmountable. Mumbai-based Dr. Ajay Mehra fools New Jersey-based Piya into believing that they have a lot in common on board a cruise, but eventually relents and confesses. After the cruise, he and Piya connect, and decide to get married. They soon settle down to a fairly harmonious lifestyle, and soon Piya becomes pregnant. Their happiness is shattered when Piya is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and soon both will be presented with a choice - go ahead with the pregnancy and subsequent birth - or endanger Piya's life.
