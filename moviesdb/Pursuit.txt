Pursuit

 An attempted assasination plot against Hitler sends one of his trusted SS officers into hiding as a Jew(thanks to plastic surgery and false papers)in a concentration camp. After the camp is liberated, he joins the Zionist army in their fight for Israel. SS-Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Von Schreader conceives an unusual plan to escape the aftermath of the Second World War by disguising himself as a Jewish Concentration Camp victim. Under the alias of Ben Grossman, Von Schreader is liberated from the camps and immigrates to Palestine where he joins the Zionist movement. Twenty five years later, living as a hero of Israel and a General in the Israeli Army, the underground SS organization ODESSA locates Von Schreader and orders to him to again serve the cause of the Third Reich.
