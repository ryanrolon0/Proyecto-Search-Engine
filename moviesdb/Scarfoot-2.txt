Scarfoot 2

 John 'Scarfoot' Koslov has been tracked down by the boss who betrayed him and now he has a new job to complete. But what should have been a routine drug theft, becomes a comedy of errors that only the most incompetent group of gangsters could have managed. Scarfoot 2 Mission Films' gritty, hilarious and cheap 2008 short film. The absurdities of the drug world will be pushed to the limits again. Witness intense martial arts and eye-brow-raising comedy in a drug world so ridiculous that it could have been imagined by an adolescent.
