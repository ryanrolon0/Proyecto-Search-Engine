Vermilion

 An obsessed artist, Gabe receives mysterious paints from a art collector and quickly Gabe immerses himself in his work - mesmerized by the colors and vivid imagery the old mystic pigments exude, the lines of reality and the work he creates on canvas seamlessly blur and what was once inanimate soon manifests itself into Gabe's world and eventually to his demise.
