Running 634

 What led me to create the heroic female torsos of my sculpture series, knights? It came from my early childhood fears, from my need for protection and safety. In recurring dreams I had as a kid, I was continually running away from those who would hurt me. I hid under staircases, I ran from planes, I pressed my weight against doors to prevent the bad guys from coming in. And in real life, as an adult, I ran for an entire day from what I then thought was a bomb hitting the world trade center. This video, running, is a montage of those dreams and that 9/11 experience.
