The Legend of Beaver Dam

 When a ghost story around the campfire awakens an evil monster, it's up to nerdy Danny Zigwitz to be the hero and save his fellow campers from a bloody massacre. Crank up the volume and get ready to scream along to this musical gore-fest in the woods. Heads will rock'n'roll!
