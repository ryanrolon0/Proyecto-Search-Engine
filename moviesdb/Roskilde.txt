Roskilde

 Every year generations of festival people from all over the world gather on the fields surrounding Roskilde to release the human beast and step into a mutual party. Step into the most sacred room of one of the biggest and most renowned festivals in Europe. Experience the festival through the eyes of the artist, the volunteer and the guest when a simple ploughed field is transformed into a musical centre of energy in which the ecstasy culminates and boundaries are crossed.
