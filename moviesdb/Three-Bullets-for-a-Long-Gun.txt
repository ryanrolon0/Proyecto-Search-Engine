Three Bullets for a Long Gun

 In Mexico, a "Gringo" saves the Mexican bandit Lucky just in time from the death penalty. One more Lucky was lucky, but the Gringo is not so friendly he needs Lucky to hunt the hidden treasure in an old and abandoned gold mine. Each of them holds to half of the location map... They have to deal with his suspicions about the other man's attitudes, and attacks from a number of men, and women, that happen on their way - as the existence of the treasure is a secret known by many. They persevere, pay a price, and eventually will get their objective - even if in part only. Nobody knows his true name, but everybody knows he is the Major, and that when he wants something, he gets it. Under his beaten officer cap, the retired officer has an ingenious brain, so he plans everything with strategy and long range vision. Two handicaps not even the Major could foresee. The first was the insidious plans of revenge by his arch-enemy Hawk-Eye, now known as the One-Eyed - after the major blinded him in their first encounter. The second was the capacity of doing mischief of the half-caste Mexican Lucky, whose life the Major saved when he was going to be hanged for his crimes - out of piety, and because Lucky is holding to half of the treasure map hidden into an abandoned gold mine somewhere. Together, and sometimes tactically separate, both men strive to attain their goals, while Hawk-Eye tries to get his hands on both halves of the map. The pair can trust no one, men or women alike, not even each other.
