Sita Swayamvar

 After years of worship, Shivbhakt Ravan acquires powers as well as immortality and misuses them to oppress the Devas and women. One of the women he molests is none other than an avatar of Devi Maa Lakshmi who swears to bring his kingdom, Lanka, to ashes. Worried Devas approach Bhagwan Shri Vishnu, who decides to end Ravan's misrule, by taking birth as the eldest son, Ramji, of Ayodhya's Maharaj Dashrath; while Sheshnag, his Conch and Chakra are reincarnated as Sarvashri Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughan respectively, and his spouse, Lakshmiji, is reincarnated as Sita. Vishnuji announces that Ravanji will meet his end at the very hands of the ones he always looked down upon - Manavs and Vanars. When her father announces Sitaji's Swayamvar, Maharishi Vishmamitra asks Ramji to accompany him to participate. It is here that Ramji will meet Ravanji, one of the competitors to try and win Sitaji's hand in marriage. But it is after the ceremony that Ramji will have to face the wrath of none other than warrior-sage Parshuram for desecrating and breaking the bow of Bhagwan Shri Shivji.
