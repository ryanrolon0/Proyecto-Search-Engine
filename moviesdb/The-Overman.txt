The Overman

 Leo Greene, a guilt-ridden accountant for an illegal racketeering ring, believes he is being followed by a woman with a spectral disposition. He recently made a statistical error in the ledgers of his current employer, which has lead to a federal investigation. Saul Caine, a sly gun for hire, accompanies Leo in an attempt to murder the investigating Federal Marshal. Leo must decide whether he will continue to take orders from his employer or embrace his conscience and sacrifice his own well-being for the lives of innocent bystanders. Serving as an experimental Film-Noir, 'The Overman' was meticulously planned and executed in one 23-minute long take to convey the gravity of Leo's situation and the reality of his scarred subconscious.
