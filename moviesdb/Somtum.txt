Somtum

 Gentle giant Barney Emerald is drugged and robbed while on holiday in Pattaya. He befriends two Thai sisters, one who can speak English, another who is a muay-thai kick-boxing champion, and stays with them until he can recover his passport. After eating some spicy "somtum" at their mother's restaurant, he accidentally demolishes the place. He vows to find a way to earn the money to rebuild the restaurant.
