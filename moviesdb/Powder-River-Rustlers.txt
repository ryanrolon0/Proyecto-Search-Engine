Powder River Rustlers

 The railroad is coming and to get the townspeople's money. Shears Williams brings in a fake Agent who tells them they must raise $50,000 as their share of a railroad bridge. Railroad Agent Rocky Lane arrives and immediately spots the fake. A phony telegram assures Rocky his friend is still alive and he sets out to find him and his abductor. The stagecoach, El Dorado's only contact with the outside word, is driven by the most famous liar in the territory, "Nugget" Clark, who finds it difficult to make the townspeople believe anything he says. When he drives recklessly into town telling about seeing a lone traveler in a buckboard being kidnapped, everyone laughs and declares that old "Nugget" is at it again. Even "Rocky" Lane, who rushed to rescue "Nugget" when his stage-horses bolted in their hurry to reach the buckboard, doesn't believe "Nugget's" story. But when a buckboard driven by a man fitting "Nugget's" description arrives in town, he thinks he he has been vindicated --- but the stranger's denial that he was kidnapped explodes "Nugget's" tale. Only "Rocky" fails to laugh, because he knows the man in the buckboard should be Bob Manning ---and isn't. Manning, "Rocky's" old friend and surveying engineer for a railroad company is being impersonated by someone else. "Rocky" sets out to solve the mystery of Manning's disappearance.
