Three Mother Fucking Amsterdams

 Three Mother Fucking Amsterdams is an experimental documentary about a young American gay guy who drinks three cans of a Dutch beer called Amsterdam. One watches the main subject gulp down the beers and gradually descend into complete drunkenness. What starts off as a drinking game soon becomes an aggressive interrogation that is carried out by a guy and a girl who stand behind the camera and bombard the main character with gay bashing insults, and discomforting questions. An unrelenting short on debasement, with a gradual descent into uneasy laughter and inventive editing sequences.
