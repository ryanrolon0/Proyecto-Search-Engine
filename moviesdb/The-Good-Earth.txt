The Good Earth

 The story of a farmer in China gives Wang Lung a freed slave as wife. By diligence and frugality the two manage to enlarge their property. But then a famine forces them to leave their land and live in the town. However it turns out to be a blessing in disguise for them... Wang is a poor farmer who bears the brunt of living a hand to mouth existence. Into his life comes a new bride, O-Lan and his luck begins to change. Not only does she bear him a son, he soon makes enough money from his harvest to buy a bit more land. Forced to relocate to the city when famine sets in, it is again O-Lan that unexpectedly finds their fortune giving them the opportunity to return to the land that Wang holds so dear. With his new-found wealth however, Wang also decides to take a much younger and prettier second wife and again, his fortunes seem to change. It is only at the end that he realizes how important O-Lan was to the good life he has led. Wang, a poor Chinese farmer, marries Olan, a slave from the 'Great House' and starts raising a family. When famine hits, Wang takes his family south to the city in search of work. Olan stays with him through hard times and revolution and helps get enough money to return the family to their northern farmlands. Wang becomes prosperous but his passions sway to a younger woman. The young woman's indiscretions with Wang's now grown up son cause a family rift but Olan remains steadfast. Then a new challenge arrives - a plague of locusts.
