The Making of 'Mr. Buechner's Dream'

 This documentary film follows the band Daniel Amos in their efforts to write and record their first new album since 1995's "Songs of the Heart." The film begins with rough home movies filmed during the earliest rehearsals for the record. From there, the film takes us right into the Recording Studio known as The Fabulous Green Room - the studio that was owned by longtime friend Gene Andrusco (also known as Gene Eugene) until his tragic death in 2000.
