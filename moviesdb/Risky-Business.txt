Risky Business

 Considered by corporate human resource departments to be the darkest, most bizarre video training film ever produced, RISKY BUSINESS demonstrated the various categories of troubled employees and the potential warning signs which might lead toward an impending confrotation. In the case of this video, an employee is murdered on the job, and, using flashbacks, the clues are given to solve the "who-dun-it" by the end of the 39 minute video.
