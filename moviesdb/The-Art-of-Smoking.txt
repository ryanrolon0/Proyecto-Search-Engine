The Art of Smoking

 Johnny Smart is a man who has the angles in life figured out. His hapless friend, Freddy Lowe, doesn't. Freddy has a million problems ranging from some dubious medical ailments and a severe case of the blues. Johnny is a man who thinks everything is solved in life by drinking beer. This Johnny argues is because he has a unique outlook on life. During a soporific Sunday afternoon, Johnny takes Freddy on a jaunt around their town, to prove his point about life being easy if you have everything in perspective.
