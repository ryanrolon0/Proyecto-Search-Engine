Thundering Thompson

 Using a false accusation of unlawful land-squatting, Bill Edwards goes to the County Seat and has Sheriff Brown to swear out a warrant against sheep-herders Marie Valerian and her father. The Sheriff sends a Deputy, "Thundering" Thompson, back to serve the warrant. Thompson learns that Edwards is only trying to force the Valerians to sell their sheep to him at a cheap price, and comes back without serving the warrant. This enrages Edwards who enlists the aid of a local cattleman and his hands to drive off the sheep. Thompson sets out to keep this from happening.
