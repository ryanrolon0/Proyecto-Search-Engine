The Cigarette

 Al and Chester are both mob men having dinner at the Boss's restaurant after hours, having a friendly discussion about film. Al is a hitman, Chester is a number cruncher. As the evening progresses, Al goes off on a tangent regarding free will and temptation. When he has finished his monologue, he reveals the true reason for their meeting out that Chester has been running numbers for His main rival, Sapienza, and has sent Al to kill Chester. Chester pleads for his life, but to no avail. Once Chester is dead, another figure enters the room, Zambronski, and tells Al he has been sent to kill Al as well, to make it look like Chester was working both sides. Al seems indifferent and dies indifferently.
