Studio Visit

 This short starts out as a visit to a sound stage to see 'Pete Smith (I)' (qv) make one of his short films. When production delays occur, Smith visits other sound stages on the lot to see what else is being filmed. The audience gets to see a sleight-of-hand artist practicing his craft, a 3-year-old girl with a perfect sense of balance, and 'Lena Horne' (qv) singing in a bathtub.
