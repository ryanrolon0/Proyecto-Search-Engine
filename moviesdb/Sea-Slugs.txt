Sea Slugs

 A group of party-hearty slackers are forced to go on a "semester at sea" after an ill-fated attempt to hoist a keg into their dorm room results in the destruction of the dean's office. Once at sea, they take over the boat (much to the horror of the captain and crew) and turn it into a non-stop party. The boat is really turned upside down when a rogue wave hits the cruise ship and capsizes it. With the captain and crew incapacitated, the slackers are forced to step up and become unlikely heroes as they lead the rest of their fellow party animals to safety in a comedic spoof of the Poseidon Adventure.
