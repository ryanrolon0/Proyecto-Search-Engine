Rookies

 Futakotamagawa High School HAD a Baseball Club/Team, but because of a fight during one one of their games, they were suspended for a year from all games. Kawato Koichi is the new Literature teacher at Futakotamagawa High, who has had his own suspension from accidentally punching a kid (from his previous teaching job) out a window. The Baseball Club is composed of minor thugs who smoke like chimneys, chase skirts, and their main past time is fighting. Kawato-Sensei's persistence, bigheartedness, and his belief in the kids allow each member one-by-one to turn their lives around. They realize that they have dreams and that dream is to play at Koshien High School Baseball Tournament. But, they run into loads of drama a long the way, including random thugs who want nothing more than to keep them from playing Baseball, fist fights, and personal drama that almost disallow them to even keep the Baseball Club/Team, let alone compete in the tournament. Eventually the Kids learn that the saying "All For One, and One For All" is the only way they will overcome all obstacles in the way.
