The Ranchman's Nerve

 Fred Peters leaves his home and intercepts the express rider on the lonely mountain road, making away with a rich haul. The express rider hurries to the sheriff's office and notifies him; a posse is formed and they start in pursuit. Safely hidden among the rocks the "terror" fires, wounding one of the deputies in the arm. After this catastrophe the posse return, their ardor cooled to take the "bad man" of the mountains. Arrived at the sheriff's office, the express rider binds up the injured arm. The sheriff announced that he needs a man of nerve to lead the posse and the express rider agrees to find the man. Going to the general store, where the boys are loitering, he takes a corner of his handkerchief in his mouth and dares any man to fight him with a Bowie, holding the other corner of the handkerchief in his mouth. Nobody accepts the challenge. Bob Steele comes up and offers to fight him any style. Taking up the other corner of the handkerchief in his mouth, he attacks the express rider so fiercely that he is compelled to drop his end, leaving Bob the winner in the unique deal. They ask him to lead the posse, and he willingly agrees to go. Again the posse arrives at the scene of the hold-up and Fred Peters, resting his rifle on a rock, fires and kills a deputy. Steele turns to the posse and urges them to go after the desperado. The men hesitate and Bob, drawing his gun from his holster, throwing it to the ground, declares, 'I'll bring him in, single-handed, without a gun.' Leaving the posse, he enters the dense thicket leading up to the outlaw's retreat. Fred Peters, thinking he has again halted pursuit, catches his rifle in a crevice in the rocks, and, taking up the bag of gold, returns to his home. Bob Steele has picked up his trail and follows him relentlessly. He comes to the crevice in the rocks and finds fresh evidence of the outlaw's recent presence, and, with the instinct of an Indian scout, he follows the trail.
