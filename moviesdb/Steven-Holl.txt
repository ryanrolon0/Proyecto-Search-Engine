Steven Holl

 Steven Holl is one of the most innovative American architects working today. In this portrait he presents some of his acclaimed works, including the Makuhari Housing Complex in Chiba, Japan and the Chapel of St. Ignatius in Seattle. The video centers on KIASMA, his Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, which we observe from groundbreaking through completion. Holl is a member of the generation that follows architects such as Peter Eisenman and Robert Venturi. Having emerged in the 1990's, this generation will build the important work of the coming decades. The video shifts back and forth between the construction and completion of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, and Steven Holl's other concurrent projects and activities.
