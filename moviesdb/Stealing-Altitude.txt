Stealing Altitude

 BASE jumping is the sport of parachuting from fixed objects such as skyscrapers (BASE is an acronym that stands for Building, Antennae, Spans (bridges) and Earth structures (cliffs) -- the four types of objects jumped.) Stealing Altitude explores the psychology of one jumper and documents his activity in the dawn and pre-dawn world of downtown Los Angeles.
