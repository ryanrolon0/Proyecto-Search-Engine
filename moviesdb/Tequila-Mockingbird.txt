Tequila Mockingbird

 John Valby, AKA "Dr. Dirty" has entertained crowds since 1974 with his brand of witty, dirty, non-politically correct music. Concerts often feature fan favorites like 'Gang Bang', 'Hey Lade', 'End of the Month' and the immortal 'Barnacle Bill'. "Tequila Mockingbird" mixes live concert footage with interviews backstage and at the recording studio. The newest songs along with some classics are intertwined with stories from the good Doctor covering the history behind the infamous piano to the origins of "Barnacle Bill". If you can't see the Dirt in person, this is your best alternative.
