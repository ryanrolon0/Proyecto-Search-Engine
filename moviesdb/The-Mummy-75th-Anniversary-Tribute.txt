The Mummy 75th Anniversary Tribute

 No film in the Universal Studios "classic monsters" canon was more impacting than 1932's THE MUMMY, starring Boris Karloff in two roles - both as the titular Mummy slumber by an unknowing explorer breaking an ancient curse, and Ardath Bey, the Egyptian prince looking for his long lost princess, Anck-es-en-Amon (memorably played by Zita Johann). Now, a group of enthusiastic fans have grouped to pay homage to that movie in honor of its 75th anniversary. Included in this DVD production are a recreation of Im Ho Tep and Mummy makeup creator Jack Pierce, interviews with Boris Karloff's daughter Sara, and special props provided by sculptor Brent Armstrong (who created the giant Im Ho Tep bust), and collectors Wally Wingert (theatrical Mummy sign) and Ron MacCloskey (Franky Award for Jack Pierce). Filmed over two days in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California, this DVD was directed, produced, authored, and assembled by members of The Art Institute of California-Orange County.
