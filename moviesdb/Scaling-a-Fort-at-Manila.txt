Scaling a Fort at Manila

 "Here we see our soldiers, assisted by the marines of Dewey's fleet, scaling a wall of the fort at Manila. We cannot but admire these brave men who, at the risk of their lives, scale the wall, not knowing at what minute they will be shot at by those at the top of the fort. It is a most inspiring picture, and one that will enthuse your audience."
