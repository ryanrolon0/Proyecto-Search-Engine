Stalag Luft

 During World War II, some Commonwealth prisoners are trying to escape from a German prison camp. Because they are old and weak, the Germans decide to escape with them. Just after the Germans are outside, the prisoners take control of the camp. Some will act as prisoners, some as Germans.
