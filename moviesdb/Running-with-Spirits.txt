Running with Spirits

 Before the Iditarod, before the Yukon Quest, the premiere sled dog race in Alaska was The All Alaska Sweepstakes. Running With Spirits is a video journal of the 100th Anniversary of the running of the All Alaska Sweepstakes. Nome to Candle and back is 408 miles through territory rich with Alaskan history from the Native peoples to the White man settlers. Everyone has a story, everyone has a spirit. This movie captures those feelings and allows the viewer in on a celebration of sled dog history. The start, the finish, some checkpoints and fun in between, Running With Spirits will enchant your spirit.
