The Magic Cut

 The Magic Cut is set in the world of show people and show business. Once you get a taste of it your infected and there's no turning back. So is it for our hero Dolores, a magician's assistant who would rather get sawed in half every night on stage with a chain saw than be a knitting housewife sitting in front of the TV. But right before the show starts she has to face reality. The magician "Magic Magnus" who is at the end of his career, shows up drunk endangering the show and Dolores's future in show business. It's time to take charge of everything including the magic chainsaw!
