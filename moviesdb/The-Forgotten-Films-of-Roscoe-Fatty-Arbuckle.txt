The Forgotten Films of Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle

 Popular rival of friend Charlie Chaplin, mentor of sidekick Buster Keaton, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (1887-1933) dominated silent film comedy from the days of Keystone until tragic events in 1921 shattered his career, throwing his film triumphs into obscurity. But this was not the end. Blacklisted by Hollywood, Roscoe Arbuckle continued directing dozens of film comedies under the pseudonym "William Goodrich" for almost another decade. Arbuckle was involved in making some 200 films in all. Sadly, the work of the True Fourth Genius of silent comedy remains neglected. That is, until now... A documentary showcasing the career of silent-era comedian 'Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle' (qv). Included are more than 30 films, including some he directed under his own name and the pseudonym "William Goodrich" after his banishment from the film industry due to a sex scandal.
