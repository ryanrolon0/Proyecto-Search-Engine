This Is Tomorrow

 The narrator discusses the evolution of the American city starting with the colonial farming villages of our forefathers. The desire for "something better" brought about the industrial revolution, which led to the workers living in cramped, filthy towns near the factories. The rise of the modern metropolis led to more beautiful cities, but the hustle and bustle and congestion of cars and people are undesirable to many. Finally, the wonders of the future planned suburban community are promoted, and the narrator reminds us that the current military war is also a fight to realize our city of tomorrow.
