Sexo E Sangue

 Raimunda is a hooker who works at Cinelândia, downtown Rio de Janeiro, during the day, and in the evenings goes to Princesa Isabel Ave., Copacabana, to get some clients staying in Hotel Meridien. Seven dangerous delinquents run away from Ilha Grande prison. A group of young rich people who play volleyball on Copacabana Beach agree to meet in the evening and go to an island, property of a baron, for the weekend. They gather at a seaside bar on Atlântica Ave. and drive to the yacht. When they're on Princesa Isabel Ave., they decide to invite some prostitutes who work there, Raimunda among them. Raimunda and two whores join the group. On the island, everything goes, and the rich women behavior is extremely vulgar. Although Raimunda is a prostitute, she has some higher moral standards, not accepting the requests of the rich and powerful. The bandits get a boat and row to the continent, but a current takes them to high seas and, after much effort, they land on the baron's island.
