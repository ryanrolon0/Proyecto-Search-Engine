The Dark Redemption

 Set two days before the events of Episode Four in the Star Wars series of films. In this fan-produced movie, Jedi Mara Jade has received a copy of the Death Star plans, which she must somehow get to the rebel forces. Unfortunately, she is being held prisoner by the Empire, and only two rebel soldiers, Zev and Klaus, can save her. As if breaking into an Imperial prison and getting the plans wasn't hard enough, bounty hunter Boba Fett is also in the neighborhood to complicate matters.
