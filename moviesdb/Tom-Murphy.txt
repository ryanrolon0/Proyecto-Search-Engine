 In 1949, Director Samuel P. Hickory set out to make the biggest film in the history of the cinema. Employing a cast and crew of thousands, and the finest technical minds that the motion picture industry had to offer, Hickory reinvented the craft of filmmaking with his epic motion picture, "Sagebrush". This brilliant western has long been recognized as one of the most grandiose achievements in the history of the genre. On the silver anniversary of that glorious film, the National Film Archive has restored and re-released the classic, but the restoration has revealed an unimaginable secret, one which has stunned fans and scholars alike.
