The Wildcat of Tucson

 When his brother Dave is put in jail, Bill Hickok returns to help him. Dave has been charged with attempted murder when the other man drew first. Judge Barlow put him there and Bill gets the Judge to confess. Bill learns that Rance McKee is behind all the trouble and he forces the Judge into the decisions he wants. So Bill heads out by himself to face McKee in the showdown. "Cannonball" Taylor helps Wild Bill Hickok's brother, Dave, escape from jail after he had shot Gus Logan in self-defense. Logan is a henchman of Rance McKee, who is driving ranchers from their lands by filing false homestead claims, and McKee, aware of his past record, is able to force Judge Barlow to issue illegal vacate orders. Wild Bill returns to Tucson and with the aid of Barlow's daughter, Vivian, acquires the needed proof against McKee, but is jailed on a false murder charge.
