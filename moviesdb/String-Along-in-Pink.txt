String Along in Pink

 This cartoon consists of a series of string gags, as the Pink Panther finds a long string on the street and starts following it, leading him into various incidents in and outside the town. In one gag, he rips open the net in a tennis court in the midst of a match between two men, another one gets him completely tangled in string while skipping rope, and one gag gets him to practice water skiing as the string leads to a river - and straight into a waterfall.
