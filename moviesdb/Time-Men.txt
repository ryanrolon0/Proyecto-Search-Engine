Time-Men

 Two college students discover a way to travel back in time, hoping to become heroes by altering tragic events in recent history. But as Ben dives deeper into himself, the pair struggle to save themselves as they rescue victims. Ben and Alex are a pair of science students with notions of doing good in between drinking beer and getting laid, and go counterclockwise by programming their computers with different time codes. They time-travel to save a kid from a hit-and-run and a house from a gas explosion, but find that the back-and-forth causes strange transformations in time travelers.
