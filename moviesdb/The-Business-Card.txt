The Business Card

 Whitney's dream of meeting the perfect man is turning into a nightmare. Then, in an unexpected moment, she meets him and gets his business card. But a strong gust of wind blows the business card out of her hands and leads Whitney on a comical, slapstick quest to recapture the card and find the man of her dreams. But in the end, she discovers that sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of you, if you only stop long enough to look up.
