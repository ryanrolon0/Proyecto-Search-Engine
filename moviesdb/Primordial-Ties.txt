Primordial Ties

 The coming-of-age story of Marjorie Ely, a beautiful 19-year-old girl possessed by only an abstracted sense of who she is or where she came from. Now alone and living with distant relatives, she imagines that she was born motherless, created through extraordinary, magical means by her mysterious and long-dead father as the daughter that he never had. As time goes on, she becomes further lost to the ordinary world around her, a banal one of gossipy girlfriends, lonely afternoons, routine jobs and awkward sexual awakenings. But a separate, nocturnal reality emerges and soon takes hold, sending forth a young, handsome and unearthly figure in a black leather jacket to reclaim her - drawing her back to her perceived origins, to where her father and fate await her.
