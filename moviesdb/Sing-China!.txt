Sing China!

 Sing China! a sequel to the Oscar-nominated Sing! tells the funny, moving story of the China music tour by the world-renowned LA Children's Chorus, which sang with John Mayer on the Tonight Show and at the Hollywood Bowl with Gustavo Dudamel. The talented, cool 11 to 14 year-olds are invited to sing in China's greatest cities a month before the Beijing Olympics and wow the Chinese audiences numbering up to l0, 000. The children sing classic songs from Irving Berlin and Duke Ellington, to Bach and Beethoven, becoming great ambassadors of goodwill for the U.S. A film with lots of laughter.
