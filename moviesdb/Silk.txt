Silk

 A married silkworm smuggler, Herve Joncour, in 19th Century France who travels to Japan to collect his clandestine cargo. While there he spots a beautiful Japanese woman, the concubine of a local baron, with whom he becomes obsessed. Without speaking the same language, they communicate through letters until war intervenes. Their unrequited love persists however, and Herve's wife Helene begins to suspect. In 1862, the son of the mayor of a French village, HervE Joncour, is invited by the silk entrepreneur Baldabiou to travel to Africa to bring healthy silkworm eggs for his factory. HervE first marries his beloved bride HElene Joncour and then he travels in the long journey. He succeeds, makes fortune and is invited to travel again to trade silkworm eggs in a longer journey to Japan. He is received by the local baron in a secret spot and falls in love for his Chinese concubine. HervE returns to HElene, but remains obsessed with the concubine.
