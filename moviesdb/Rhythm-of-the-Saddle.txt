Rhythm of the Saddle

 Pomeroy is after McClure's rodeo contract. Gene is McClure's foreman and suspects Pomeroy is behind the accidents occurring. Gene's plan to trap Pomeroy by using Frog's recording machine backfires when Gene is accused of the murder committed by Pomeroy. Avoiding the law, Gene has another plan and puts Frog to work again with his recorder.
