Sky Trackers

 NASA's Tidbinbilla Tracking station in Australia prepares for the re-entry of a decaying satellite containing a dangerous biological experiment. It is decided to bring it down near the station, for which job Dr Tony Masters has been brought in to assist Dr Spencer. At the same time, and unknown to her, Dr Spencer's daughter Ali has been using her computer to hack in to the station and reprogram the dish to communicate with a decommissioned satellite. Meanwhile, an unscrupulous industrial espionage agent, has penetrated the station and is preparing to take charge of the re-entry process, causing havoc and a chase through the Australian countryside to find the potentially deadly satellite.
