The Zen of Bobby V

 The Zen of Bobby V focuses on former MLB manager Bobby Valentine and his current job managing the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan. The doc gives viewers unprecedented access to Valentine and his team, visiting a world where cheerleaders chant between innings and rock bands perform before each game, while exploring the impact globalization has on the game's present and future. It is the best look inside the culture of Japanese baseball through the eyes of one of American baseball's greatest current ambassadors.
