The Miller and the Sweep

 In front of a flour mill, two men fight. One is the miller, and he's swinging a bag of flour in the scuffle. The other is a chimney sweep, and he's swinging what may be a bag of flour, but when it breaks open, it's clearly something else. Well into the havoc, spectators gather and give chase to the flour-covered sweep and the "well-sooted" miller. A miller, while flirting with a young lady, suddenly bumps into a chimney sweep carrying a bag of soot. After an exchange of words, they start to fight and each uses his bag of cloth as a club. After the battle is over neither can be recognized. The air is so filled with flour and soot that the fighters are almost lost sight of for a few seconds. Very laughable.
