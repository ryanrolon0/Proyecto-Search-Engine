The Daring Years

 Cabaret dancer Suzie La Motte (Harris) is in love with Jim Moran (King), a boxer, but she tempts a young man named John Browning (Mack). Moran and John get into a fight in which Moran accidentally shoots himself. Out of anger at John, Suzie accuses him of Moran's murder. It is only at the last minute that John is saved from the electric chair by Suzie's confession of the truth.
