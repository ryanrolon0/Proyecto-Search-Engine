The Natural Drive

 In this documentary, the audience will see two participating competitors in West Australia's natural bodybuilding circa. The two competitors, male and female are followed over a period of 2 weeks throughout which we follow their extremes in diet and training, their motivation behind their will to compete and the results that follow during and post competition. The idea is to find out more about this fascinating sport and the dedication it takes to achieve the muscularity the trainers are aiming for. Because although it is not recognised as a mainstream sport, we will get a more articulate view of the competitors dedication, motivation and why they love competing.
