The Magic Hour

 Toby Lewiston is obsessed with The Book, an ancient tome hidden away within a small-town book store called The Magic Hour. Like many before him, he is drawn back, lying to himself about the hold The Book has over him. The mysterious book dealer, Geneva Boutillier, entices him to read another story. After all, what will just one hurt? Yet after that, there is another...and another...and another...stories of fear, insanity, death, and hope.
