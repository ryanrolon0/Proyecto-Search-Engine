The Boogie Man Will Get You

 Winnie Slade, a young divorcee, buys an old historic house from nutty Professor Billings, who lives there with his daffy housekeeper and bizarre neighbors, in order to convert it into a hotel. She allows them to continue to live on the property - unaware that the Professor continues to experiment unsuccessfully on traveling salesmen, the bodies of whom have filled the cellar. They are joined by a variety of eccentric characters including a quack doctor who doubles as the town's sheriff, Winnie's frenetic ex-husband, an oddball choreographer, a punchdrunk traveling salesman, and a lunatic escapee from the Italian army. Nathaniel Billings sells his house off to a naive young woman but stays in order to continue work on his experiments of making superman out of door-to-door salesmen. Dr. Lorencz- the mayor, justice of the peace, notary, sheriff and coroner of the town- becomes interested in the experiments after trying to arrest Prof. Billings. After which the hilarity ensues.
