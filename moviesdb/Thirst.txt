Thirst

 'Thirst' is a dry comedy about addiction in the family. Patrick, a young man in his twenties lives at home with his aging Mother and vague recollections of his Father. Patrick's Father's death by drowning, when Patrick was quite young, is a taboo subject that is not discussed but weighs on Patrick heavily. After a night out on the town with Patrick, Stan, Patrick's best and only friend, becomes concerned about Patrick's well being. After speaking with his mother and extended family they decide to intervene on Patrick's behalf. The intervention culminates with Patrick being locked in his room and deprived of water. Patrick's struggle to understand his situation and his actions explore addiction in the family and the characteristics of Adult Children of Acoholics (ACOAs.) Though most audience members have never experienced addiction to a substance, everyone knows what it is like to be thirsty. In this way the audience may more directly relate to the plight of the addict and make sense of the relative necessity of his actions.
