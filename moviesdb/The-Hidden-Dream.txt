The Hidden Dream

 This 60 minute documentary portrays the little known history of America's second largest immigrant group since 1990 ... Filipinos.  Survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March and equally brutal Japanese prisoner of war camps share their memories of courage, torture, and death.  They speak with outrage of the Rescission Act of 1946 which denied them the benefits and recognition deserved as being part of the United States Army.  Impassioned protests and political speeches eventually enabled the Rescission Act to itself be rescinded in 2008.  The Filipino veterans, many of whom are in their late 80's and 90's are dying at an alarming rate with many of their claims not yet realized.    This complex relationship with America continues today as Filipinos share their pride upon being sworn in as United States citizens while other Filipinos remain in the shadows fearing deportation.  Today's Filipino youth, the first generation to be primarily born in this country, relate their confusion at what it means to be Filipino and American as well as their frustration that the truths of The Hidden Dream have been hidden from them.
