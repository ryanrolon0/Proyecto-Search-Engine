The Stranger of the Hills

 A young girl falls in love with a cowboy known as "The Stranger". A rival for the girl's affections accuses the man of actually being a notorious criminal known as "The Killer", for whom there is a substantial reward. The sheriff arrests The Stranger, but the girl manages to get him released. However, The Stranger is not exactly who he seems to be, and neither is the man who accused him of being The Killer.
