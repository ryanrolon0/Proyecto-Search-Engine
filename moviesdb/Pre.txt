Pre

 At the turn of the century there was a vibrant, off-the-beaten-track theatre scene on New York City's Lower East Side. PRE revisits this vital, indigenous theatre scene just before it was lost to history. PRE takes place 3 days after 9/11 and documents an underground theatre ensemble struggling to decide whether to be the first play after 9/11 to re-open.
