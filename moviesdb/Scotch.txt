Scotch

 Danny stops in a local bar to have a drink, 'anything but scotch' since this was his father's drink of choice. In an adjacent seat, his father Daniel, who abandoned the family for a life of alcohol, stares back at him through drunken eyes. After confronting his worst nightmare, Danny leaves the bar, ignoring his father's plea for forgiveness. Months later, at his father's gravestone, Danny toasts is father's life with a drink of scotch.
