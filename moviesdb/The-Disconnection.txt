The Disconnection

 A young and timid catholic guy takes a young lady to lunch. When the subject of abortion is raised she becomes aware that his stance is far from new school liberal and gives him an earful before storming out of the restaurant. He then tries again, this time with a brassy African American girl who is none too please to learn she's dealing with an old school cat. She takes his beliefs as a form of judgment and reacts similarly to date #1. After striking out twice he tries yet again. This time he is prepared to get with the program and open his mind to a woman's way f thinking. Will the conservative Asian girl he's with be thrilled?
