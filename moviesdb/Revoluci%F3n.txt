Revolución

 REVOLUCION work-in-progress documentary. Through a vast collection of revolutionary images and the stories behind them, we discover the legacy of a people, a country, and a revolution. It retraces the footsteps, the camera angles, the blessings, the terrors, and the yearnings of a country, as experienced by three distinct generations of photographers. We meet four men whose work is a mosaic of fragmented moments spanning 42 years. Reviewed collectively, their work offers a picture of a whole Cuba under the volcanic force of Fidel Castro.
