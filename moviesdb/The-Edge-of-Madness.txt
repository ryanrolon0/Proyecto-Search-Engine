The Edge of Madness

 The Edge of Madness explores the experiences of a female war journalist Gaby Grebo, against the backdrop of a bloody war of ethnic cleansing. When Gaby travels with French President George Mitterand in his attempt to break the Serbian siege on Sarajevo, she befriends a young Bosnian woman named Zlata who opens her eyes to atrocities she has only faced from the point of view of a camera, but which she now must face more closely than she ever imagined.
