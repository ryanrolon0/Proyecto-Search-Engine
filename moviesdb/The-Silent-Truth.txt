The Silent Truth

 On a U.S. military base in Iraq, PFC Lavena Lynn Johnson is found dead, shot in the head. The Army rules it a suicide. Later, independent forensic evidence reveals she was raped, mutilated and murdered. By her own fellow troops? It would appear so. However, the military refuses to re-open the case. Since the United States launched the Second Gulf War, over ninety-four women in the Military have died in Afghanistan or during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Of these deaths, some twenty occurred under extreme suspicious circumstances. The Department of Defense has characterized these deaths as 'non-combat' related injuries and as in Lavena's case, ruled six of them as suicides. 'The Silent Truth' follows the Johnson's search for truth and justice for their daughter.
