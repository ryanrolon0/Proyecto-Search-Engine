Sleep Lab

 Edgar goes to a sleep clinic to participate in an overnight observational session to see what can be done about his sleepwalking. Beyond the already other sleeping patients, the only person he encounters upon his arrival is Henry, who, after hearing Edgar's situation, tells him they can help him here. As Henry goes through the prep then observational processes, first with Henry then with others, he's not sure if he's made the right decision in coming here.
