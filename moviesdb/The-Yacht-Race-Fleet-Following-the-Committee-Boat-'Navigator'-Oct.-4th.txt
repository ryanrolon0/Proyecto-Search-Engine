The Yacht Race Fleet Following the Committee Boat 'Navigator' Oct. 4th

 This is a most wonderful picture. The entire fleet which was off Sandy Hook for the purpose of witnessing the yacht races, is following the Committee boat "Navigator," and the great cloud of smoke which arises from the many craft adds interest to the picture. One by one the boats come by the "Navigator" for the purpose of reading the official figures, thus enabling us to secure close views of each one as it passes.
