Sleuth

 Two extremely clever British men are in a game of trickery and deceit. Andrew Wyke, an aging famous author who lives alone in a high-tech mansion, after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man; and Milo Tindle, an aspiring actor, equipped with charm and wit, who demonstrates both qualities once again. When Wyke invites Tindle to his mansion, Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. However, Wyke seems far more interested in playing mind games with his wife's new lover, and lures him into a series of actions he thoroughly planned in seeking revenge on his unfaithful spouse. Milo Tindle, a struggling actor and a chauffeur, doesn't know what to expect when he comes to visit the rich and successful mystery novelist, Andrew Wyke. After all, he is stealing Andrew's wife. His first surprise is learning that the comfortable old English country house is, on the inside, cold and stark and filled with monitors, cameras and other surveillance devices. Its owner, Andrew, lays a thin sheen of civility over his malicious and insulting chatter, and then he gets down to business. That's Milo's second surprise. Andrew claims he wants to be rid of his now-detested wife. But if Andrew agrees to give his wife a divorce and hand her over to Milo, he expects something in return. Andrew has just made the first move in a game of cat and mouse that may prove deadly.
