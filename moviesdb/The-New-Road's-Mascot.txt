The New Road's Mascot

 For his daughter's sake, a discharged workman yields to temptation and commits an act which brings consequences of such a nature that all his manhood is aroused, and by strenuous efforts the danger which threatens is averted. One of the best railroad stories ever released, for woven through the swift and vivid action there is a splendid plot, in which are involved characters so humane that they compel interest from the start.
