This Ain't Gilligan's Island XXX

 A small film crew headed by Rob Naughty arrives on Gilligan's Island to finish their latest film. When they bump into the castaways, they decide to use up all of their extra tape by enticing them into action and filming them without their knowing. The promise of getting off the island after 7 years even brings Gilligan, Ginger and Mary Ann together for one last night on the beach.
