The Stag Hunt

 Hunting the stag is great sport and here we see it in full--the hounds chasing a noble stag through the water and woodlands until finally exhausted, the stag is run down and finally dispatched. A rope is tied around him and he is hauled out of the water where he fell and is drawn up on the bank where he is viewed by a large number of persons gathered to see him.
