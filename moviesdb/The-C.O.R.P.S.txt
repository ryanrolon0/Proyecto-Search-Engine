The C.O.R.P.S

 The C.O.R.P.S. is a satirical look at the film community's obsession with stardom and celebrity. Actors now have a chance to work on films even after they are dead. A new union, the Consortium of Residual Performers, or The C.O.R.P.S., has just been founded to allow actors to play the 'dead body' when their time has come.
