Rushland Ridge

 'Rushland Ridge' tells the story of a small, family-run vineyard and winery in suburban Pennsylvania. Filmed entirely on super 8mm cameras over the course of a year, the film interweaves the process of wine making with candid interviews of the family members and the local community of friends and patrons who support their business.
