Under the Unda

 Under the Unda is a short documentary about the NYC underground Hip Hop scene. And the search to find out, what does 'underground' mean? Interviews vary from music industry veterans like Scott Storch, DJ Muggs, and The Pharcyde to the guys still on the bubble like Saigon and F.L.I.K.S.
