The Golf Girls and the Tramp

 A very funny picture. Two girls walking along a picturesque country road next to the golf links. They are carrying golf bags of checked Robroy cloth. A tramp appears coming up the road, and the girls become frightened. Suddenly an idea beams upon them. One of the girls steps behind a tree, and, converting the golf bags into a pair of trousers, quickly dons them, making a complete man's costume together with her golf jacket. She then steps out from behind the tree and confronts Weary Willie. He is badly shocked, and falls to the ground, going through funny evolutions, which make a most laughable closing to the scene.
