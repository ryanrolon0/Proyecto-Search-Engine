The Formosan Macaque-Mao-Mao Lien and Her Friend

 This film is centered on a group of Formosan macaques that had been under observation and research in the Kenting, Wildlife Conservation Zone during the last five years. It is focused on their history, living environment, diet habits (tree shaking, for cleaning food hunting, playing, mating mother-child relationships, and reproduction).
