Public Stenographer

 The wisecracking and attractive public stenographer Ann McNair spends most of her time continuing to fend off the greedy hands of her employer. On her way to get a new job Ann has a car breakdown on a desolate stretched road. Ann is eventually aided by the handsome James "Jimmy" Martin Jr., who initially courteous acts like all other men in her life. Eventually Jim is in love with Ann. So it seems that Ann at long last drops her hard-boiled veneer, towards Jimmy in particular.
