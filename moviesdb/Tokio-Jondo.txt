Tokio Jondo

 Flamenco music originally from Spain has fascinated the Japanese for more than 40 years. In the search of the possible reasons for this phenomenon, we are discovering similarities and contrasts of these two opposed cultures. 15000 km is the distance between Japan and Spain, but, for many Japanese, it seems like doesn't bother. The pure flamenco music is worshipped by many Japanese, so fascinated by the enchantment of 'the spell of flamenco' that, without fear, they jump themselves into emptiness to change radically their lives.
