The Sid Boyum Sculpture Project

 In the summer of 2000, residents of the Schenk-Atwood neighborhood in Madison Wisconsin became curators of the largest donation of public sculpture in the city's history. Seventeen of nearly 70 concrete works of art created by folk artist Sid Boyum were moved to the parks and pathways of his near-east side neighborhood. This film chronicles the unique public art project's democratic process, celebrates the work and dedication of Sid's friends, neighbors, and admirers, and features music by neighborhood musicians.
