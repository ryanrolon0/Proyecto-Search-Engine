Revenge of the Ring Thing

 'The Revenge of the Ring Thing' is a Comic Fantasy/Adventure film-short and satire based on 'The Lord of The Rings movies. It's One Day in the life of Randalf, the 1,175 year-old, long lost youngest brother of Gandalf, the Great Grey Wizard, as he attempts to practice for his Wizards Exam tomorrow, while ignoring a 500 year-old curse that swears of Gandalf's brothers by sundown today'. Randalf ignores the ESP warnings of his roommate (an ex-wizard marrionette named Spanky) to flee the, '...approaching Evil Warrior Princess of Doom'; prefering to expound about the old days in Gondor and almost right but, I was there', and practice so he can finally join his older, wizard-brother Gandolf in the Sorcerers Guild...
