Tiger the Cat

 This project is a series of animated shorts about Tiger the Cat and his friend Dennis the Dog.  Together they dance, swim, find romance and more. This animation was hand drawn on the computer by a 14-year girl.  In addition to the animation, she also performed portions of the musical soundtrack and voice-overs.
