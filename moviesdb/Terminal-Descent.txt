Terminal Descent

 Four riot-girls and their guy pal get together to do some urban exploring in the Buffalo Central Terminal. Everything is going smoothly until the sun sets and a gang of hooded "dwellers" assault the group. In a running battle through the vast catacombs of the terminal the survivors must fight their way back into the light or perish in darkness. Murder. Rape. Cannibalism. This is survival horror.
