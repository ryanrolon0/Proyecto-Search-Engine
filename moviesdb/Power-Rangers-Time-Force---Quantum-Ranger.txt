Power Rangers Time Force - Quantum Ranger

 Archeologists dig up a mysterious box and the evil Ransik sends Brickneck, a mutant, to retrieve it. At the site, he's confronted by the Power Rangers and the Silver Guardians, an elite security force. As they fight, Guardian Eric takes the box and discovers that it holds the Quantum Morpher. With it, he transforms himself into the Quantum Ranger (which enrages the Red Power Ranger) and he defeats Brickneck. Later, Quantum sees the mutant Commandocon going through a time hole so he and the Red Ranger pursue him...to a pre-historic world. Commandocon soon finds his quarry-the robotic Quantasaurus Rex-and places a control device on the giant creature, and they return to the present with the Quantum Ranger and the Red Ranger close behind. Back home, Commandocon orders the Q-Rex to destroy the city. With the Morpher, the Red Ranger says he could stop the Q-Rex but the Quantum Ranger refuses to hand it over and the two Rangers fight for control. Is everyone doomed? Or can the two Rangers cooperate long enough to conquer the mighty Q-Rex and his diabolical masters?
