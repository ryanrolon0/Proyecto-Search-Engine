The Bocuse d'Or

 This 1999 documentary features Canadian Chef Robert Sulatycky in his quest to become the first North American chef to break into the top five, so far the exclusive domain of European countries. Robert went through a five year process to get to the Bocuse d'Or in Lyon, France. The documentary shows chefs from 22 countries creating the best food in a race against the clock. For many chefs this competition is the most important one they will ever enter in their culinary careers.
