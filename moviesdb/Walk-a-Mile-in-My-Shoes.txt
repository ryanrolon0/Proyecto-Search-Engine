Walk a Mile in My Shoes

 Since 1987 the Center for Grieving Children in Portland, ME has worked with a largely volunteer staff to provide a place of comfort and loving support to grieving children, teens, families and the community through peer support, outreach and education. This heartwarming film follows a group of middle school children, displaced from their home countries around the globe by war and forced migration, as they participate in the Center's Multicultural Peer Support Program. The children learn to live and laugh on their journey together, and that love makes things better. The piece was produced by four Media Studies majors at the University of Southern Maine.
