Vacillator

 A young man selfishly enters a marriage with a much younger woman. Their union, once a bud of sincere promise, now revealed to be nothing more than a mistake made during a month of fleeting excitement. Today it is a facade, poisoned by youth and scaled by doubt. In this story of vanilla existence, a man searches for a reason to maintain his sincerity. Reason is personified into another woman, however, one who reminds him of his wife but without the labor of marriage. To feel entitled to the world when you are bound to someone by law. This is youth and it can be detrimental.
