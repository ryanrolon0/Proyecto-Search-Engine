The Dance Contest

 Popeye and Olive visit a dance hall, where a contest is in progress (though judge Wimpy seems far more interested in his hamburgers than the dancers). He dances terribly. Bluto cuts in, and Popeye sulks in a corner next to a convenient bowl of spinach. Popeye dances impressively; Bluto comes back and manhandles Olive.
