Red Gold

 In 1943, 50,000 captured Italian soldiers are shipped to prisoner-of-war camps in the United States. The Americans don't want them, don't like them and don't trust them. In a small town in Indiana, the Italians are put to work in the fields. To the townspeople they are the enemy and the enemy is killing their sons. But in the midst of war, two young people fall in love - Orlando, an enlisted soldier from Catania, Sicily and Laura, the local girl.
