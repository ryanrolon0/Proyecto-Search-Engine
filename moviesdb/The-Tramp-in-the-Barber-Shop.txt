The Tramp in the Barber Shop

 Here we see a tonsorial artist engaged in shaving a man, and when through the man pays his price and departs. A young man enters and seats himself on a chair and the bootblack proceeds to polish his shoes. A tramp enters and asks for a shave. The barber fairly hurls him into the chair and prepares him for the operation. The tramp is restless and his movements suggests to the audience that he has not bathed within the last few hours. The barber finally lathers him and then strops his razor. The restlessness of the tramp impedes his progress and he jumps up on the chair and sits on him, but all to no purpose. Losing his patience he climbs up on another chair and lifting a pail of water high over his head he pours the contents all over the tramp, who, after frantic efforts, leaps out of the chair.
