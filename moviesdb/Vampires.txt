Vampires

 In Thailand, the Americans Connor and his girlfriend Amanda quarrel in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire Niran, and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins to a clan of "good" vampires leaded by Sang, trying to save Amanda from the claws of Niran.
