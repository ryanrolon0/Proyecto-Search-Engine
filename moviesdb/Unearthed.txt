Unearthed

 In 1987, the limits of horror were pushed when rising horror novelist Clive Barker stepped behind the camera and introduced movie-goers to a new breed of villain in Hellraiser. The Cenobites - "angels to some, demons to others" - led by "Pinhead" (essayed by Doug Bradley) would lead a charge through nearly two decades and eight films, clad in leather and rending flesh. And although the Hellraiser franchise would slip from Barker's creative grasp, its mark in counter-culture cinema was palpable. This documentary will explore every facet and theme of the entire series.
