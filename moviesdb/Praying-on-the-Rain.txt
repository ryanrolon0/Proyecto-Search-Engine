Praying on the Rain

 TOM and SARAH, a young married couple in rural Montana, struggle daily to cope with the loss of their only child. Sarah can't talk about it, while Tom desperately needs to. In addition, their deceased daughter's beloved horse has taken seriously ill. With their relationship at the breaking point, they encounter a mysterious old cowboy, TRAVIS, seemingly lost and suffering dementia. Sarah insists on taking the old man into their home, where he helps himself to their hospitality and tells a tall tale of long-lost love. As the night passes, Travis steals away into the stable and, come sunrise, he is gone. But when Tom and Sarah discover that the old cowboy has healed their daughter's horse, their hearts are touched forever.
