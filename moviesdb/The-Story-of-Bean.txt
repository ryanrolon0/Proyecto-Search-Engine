The Story of Bean

 A little documentary which simply chronicles the story behind the television series "Mr. Bean" (1989) and the film Bean (1997), released that year. It tells the story of 'Rowan Atkinson' (qv) and shows clips of him as a child, as well as shows skits from "Not the Nine O'Clock News" (1979) and "Black Adder, The" (1983) and, of course, sketches from the Mr. Bean series and clips from the film.
