Quantum Dreaming

 "Quantum Dreaming" combines a dream sequence with the nature of the unified field in quantum physics resulting in an exploration of the poetic universe, a journey within a journey and a dream within a dream. This video art piece expresses that sense of overlapping, emerging, morphing universe in a linear way. Award-winning mixed media and digital collage artist and independent video producer Karen Landey, uses these passions to explore the mysterious realm of dreams and visions. By blending and layering rich and unrelated images, she explores the strange world of the unified field of quantum physics, which underlies creation and contains the potential for unlimited possibilities.
