Reality Fright Night

 Babes & Ghosts is the most recent creation of award winning reality show producer Sara Davis. This new show will bring two of the greatest reality show themes to a spectacular collision, hot babes and ghost hunting. The cash prize $25,000 and a one year modeling contract will go to the first girl who makes contact with a ghost. What they all ignore is that the challenge won't be finding a ghost; the real challenge will be staying alive.
