The House of the Dead 2

 Nearly two years have passed since the Curien Case. Little did Rogan and G know, it was far from over. Goldman, who funded Dr. Curien's research, has picked up where he left off, creating smarter, more advanced zombies. As AMS agents James Taylor & Gary Stewart, you must blaze through the streets of New York, ridding it of a nightmare that has returned full force. February 26, 1998, two years after the Curien Mansion incident. The secret international agency, AMS, has launched an investigation concerning the cause of the Curien case, in order to prevent the world from experiencing a similar outbreak. Strange occurrences, however, are reported to be taking place in the city of Brooklyn, New York, the last known location of AMS agent "G," who has been gone missing! But the AMS Agents James Taylor and Gary Stewart are dispatched along with Amy Crystal and Harry Harris to investigate and evacuate the populace, but are met with an undead horde developed by the evil Goldman, the president of the eminent DBR Corporation and an expert on the genome theory who funded the late Dr. Curien's experiments.
