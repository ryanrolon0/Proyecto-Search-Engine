We Choose Happiness

 There is no secret. We can only attain true happiness through personal change, and through actions directed towards a greater purpose. Our civilization has sunken into a world of pain. The race to accumulate wealth is stealing our happiness. Productivity and materialism thrive at the expense of our well-being and have led us into abandoning our true reason for being. There are people around us who are truly happy. How do they find the energy to see the world positively, despite seeing people suffering all around them? What can we learn from them?
