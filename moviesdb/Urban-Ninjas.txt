Urban Ninjas

 When Rich Nice gets out of jail he goes back to his same ol' criminal ways selling drugs, pimping women, robbing and stealing. Dan and his brother Sirus teach martial arts at the local karate school. When a young student at the school is murdered, Dan and Sirus have good reason to believe Rich Nice had something to do with it. That's when they take matters into their own hands and, as masked Ninjas, rob the drug dealers who work for Rich Nice and devise a plan to get rid of him once and for all.
