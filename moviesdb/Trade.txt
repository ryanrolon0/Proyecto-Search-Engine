Trade

 A crooked vice cop learns Internal Investigations are on to him. He attempts to persuade his hooker girlfriend (who, he believes, is having his baby) to flee the country with him. The hooker's pimp has sold the baby, sight unseen, to the Russian mob (along with others he has forced his 'girls' to conceive). All the babies haven't been delivered on time and the Russian mob want their goods right away. Hooker contrives a deadly end game for her users and abusers.
