 Attractive ramp model, Nandita Chopra, has a boyfriend in Yash Dayal, who runs a TV serial 'Andhvishwas' - documenting proof that there are no ghosts, ghouls or even God. Things spiral out of control when she finds wounds all over her body; is stalked by a mysterious male; and ends up hospitalized on grounds that she may have attempted to kill herself after finding out she was pregnant. After recuperating, she befriends her stalker, who identifies himself as Prithvi Singh, and sets out on a journey with him to Kalindi, Himachal Pradesh, to try and unravel the mystery behind the dialogue "Tum Sadh Chukey Ho, Asudh Ho Tum".
