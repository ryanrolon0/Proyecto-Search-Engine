The Naggers' Day of Rest

 It's Sunday, and as usual a wife is nagging her husband, this time about the whereabouts of the Sunday newspaper which she's sure he's hiding from her. The husband is just as irritated by her nagging since this time it is interfering with him trying to take a shave and brush his teeth. Their argument extends to what belongs to whom and what each person contributes to the household. They end up doing things and making remarks just to irritate the other. Their argument reaches a whole different level when a pretty neighbor gets peripherally involved. The constantly bickering couple are at it on a pleasant Sunday at home. She thinks he's taking too much time in the bathroom and he thinks she's using too much shelf space. She wants him out of there so she can take a bath but if anything, it just seems to have the opposite effect.
