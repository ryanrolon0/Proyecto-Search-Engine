The Still Unknown

 Utah paints hammers. Alister plays piano. Jean-Pierre writes poetry and talks about himself. Clark bullshits about weird stuff. Theremin does nothing, but is always in the right place at the right time. Frank dreams of being famous. Into the picture steps Terence Blenk, elementary school janitor, to become their "project." Only, there's something kind of off about him, like someone you'd meet at the wrong kind of bus stop. Still, everyone will pool their talents to train and publicize Terence to land that lead role in The Hindenberg
