Rough Sea at Dover

 The surf pounds against a breakwater on which are visible several people standing. The wall looks to be about 20 feet above sea level and extend at least 100 feet into the water. A large wave rolls picturesquely along the wall toward the shore. Smaller waves follow. Then the scene changes to river water flowing. We see both shores branch are visible; on the far shore, there appears to be a low wall with trees beyond it. The camera is stationary in both shots.
