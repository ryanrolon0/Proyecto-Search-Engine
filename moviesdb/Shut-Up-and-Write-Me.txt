Shut Up and Write Me

 Emotionally retarded? Manic-depressive? Sexually deviant? Lewis Carroll, JM Barrie, Edward Lear and Mark Twain, were also brilliant, launching a Golden Age of kid's lit. Today there are new icons, JK Rowling, Lemony Snicket, Eoin Colfer, Philip Pullman... Captain Underpants? Shut Up and Write Me! is a documentary about writing for kids. Would be writer, AJ De Aquila, studies the old masters and attempts his own masterpiece, goaded by two daemons, a stuck-up Moose, played by Rick Roberts and a cynical Pigfish. Dishing out advice are authors and experts including Richard Scrimger, Lisa Pijuan and Robert Munsch; Roald Dahl offers words of wisdom from beyond the grave.
