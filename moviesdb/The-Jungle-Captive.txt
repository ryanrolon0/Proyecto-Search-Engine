The Jungle Captive

 Once again Paula ape woman is brought back to life, this time by a mad doctor and his disfigured assistant, who also kidnaps a nurse in order to have a female blood donor. By this time, Paula's been brain damaged by experiences in the last film, so there's not much for her to do except wander around.
