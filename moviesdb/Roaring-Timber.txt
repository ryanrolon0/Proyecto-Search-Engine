Roaring Timber

 Jim Sherwood, toughest logging boss in the timber country, takes on his toughest assignment when he agrees to cut an enormous volume of timber for Andrew MacKinley, who has to deliver the timber within sixty days. Jim, offered a big bonus, gets his men more pay and wins cooperation all around except from Harrigan, the job engineer. MacKinley is killed in an automobile crash, and his daughter, Kay, takes over. Sam Garvin, the general manager, wants Kay to sell out so his confederates can take over the contract. She declines and Harrigan flies to the camp. Jim, already sullen because he has just lost a huge quantity of timer in a dam break,is infuriated when Garvin says he has no intention of paying the promised bonus. Jim retaliates by slowing down production, and in order to run up expenses, orders Harrigan to build a section of railroad over a little-used gorge. With production slowed down, expenses climbing and low morale among the workers, Kay, with her fluttery Aunt Mary, decides to visit the camp. She reproves Jim for building an unnecessary railroad and sides with Harrigan. Jim quits and most of his men follow him. After a riot involving Harrigan's "scab workers, Jim's men and the State Police, Kay asks Jim to take over again, revealing that it was never her intention to withhold his promised bonus. The fired Harrigan attempts to sabotage the operation, but Jim manages to produce the timber needed to make the contract, thereby winning the respect and heart of Kay.
