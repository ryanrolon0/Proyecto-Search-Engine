Willthe encouragement of his old teacher, played my Ealing Studios stalwart, Edie Martin, he takes on Maggie's dad at the council election and wins. The message of the film is that eveyone can make a difference in local democracy, and that if the authorities go against the wishes of the electorate, they can be thrown from office.
