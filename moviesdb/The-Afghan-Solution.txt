The Afghan Solution

 THE AFGHAN SOLUTION insiders that illustrates the value of revisiting the original US strategies to rout the Taliban in the days immediately following 9/11 in order to achieve success in Afghanistan today and examins the issues that are at the root of a failed nation-building experiment in Afghanistan. An insiders' account told firsthand by Afghan parliamentary members and citizens, warlords, NATO's ISAF brass, UN mediators, NGO personnel, American politicians, US Special Forces, and Taliban commander Mullah Jaffar - it is a tale that exposes rapidly changing strategies that failed due to lack of commitment with its disastrous results. The film puts forth that unless original strategies, enforced by significant policy change in the United States are put into place, the current state-of-play threatens to bring down the new democratic Afghan government, and see the war in Afghanistan that the US thought we won nine years ago, fully re-ignite and ensnare the country where we've spent nearly a decade trying to make viable; rendering the land of Afghanistan a base for terrorists' operations once again.
