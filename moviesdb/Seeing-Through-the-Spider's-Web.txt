Seeing Through the Spider's Web

 For the first time in a decade, the filmmaker, a Korean-Canadian woman (37), visits her emotionally estranged mother (67), now living in Korea, to find out why she is not returning "home" to Canada. The video investigates the shock of migration and the complicated mother-daughter relationship. Slowly stories unfold as fragments of memory, cut seamlessly through the present and past of tangled familial webs, which uncover female narratives buried beneath patriarchal decisions. New disclosures connect the physical distance between family members with several episodes of mistrust and misunderstanding, such as the filmmaker casting distant relatives as villains. As the mother reveals her personal experiences, she and her daughter are finally able to "see" each other.
