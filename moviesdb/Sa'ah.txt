Sa'ah

 Change is imminent within all cultures and nothing shows this more clearly than with the growing youth of indigenous peoples. And to meet the ongoing ebb and flow of life, the DinE must retain lingual and cultural teachings to ensure their path to Sa'ah Nagháí Bik'eh Hózhóón (Walking in Beauty into Old Age). In essence, this is the fundamental pursuit of all DinE a long life. This short documentary was initially thought to provide a glimpse of a remarkable young DinE man's life on the reservation. When the idea falls through, a DinE film student goes to a medicine man for help. This documentary entitled Over There follows a one-day trip through the Navajo Nation Reservation and shares what happens on one such journey. This reveals echoes from the medicine man that narrate the meaning of the DinE philosophy and reminds us to ask ourselves what we are teaching our children.
