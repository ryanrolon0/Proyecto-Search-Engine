The Elopement

 The exterior of a villa is shown. The girl appears at a window and descends by a ladder with the assistance of her lover. The trunk is lowered with much effort, but no sooner is it safely on the ground when the cover opens and the irate father steps out and proceeds to thrash the young man. The mother appears in the meantime, and compels the girl to return to the house.
