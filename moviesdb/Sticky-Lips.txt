Sticky Lips

 Randy Spears as an adult movie director who must live the same terrible day over and over, on the set of a bad porno, with too little money and time to do a good job, too many difficult performers, and too many of all the other problems that can and often do arise in the making of these things. Can he finish his movie? Can he wake from his nightmare? Is it even a nightmare, or the life he has chosen to live? Will he grow as a person, or just yell "cut" and do it all over again?
