The Good Loser

 Ray, a high school student, is one of those people who wins at everything. He enters a speaking contest, and magnanimously decides to gave a few tips to Marilyn, a young girl who has also entered the contest. To Roy's surprise--and anger--Marilyn cleans Roy's clock and wins hands down. Roy begins to harbor dark thoughts about Marilyn. The coach of the debating team, noticing this, decides to sit Roy down and have a talk with him about winning and losing, before Roy does to Marilyn what the contest judges did to him.
