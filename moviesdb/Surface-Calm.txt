 One morning Ellen Perry, a nervous housewife, finds an old chain that triggers a series of attacks against herself as she slowly loses her grip on reality. Her husband leaves for a business trip, and while she tries to keep herself occupied, no amount of vacuuming or scrubbing can fill the emptiness that surrounds her. When Neil returns, Ellen learns that his presence is no longer enough to keep her mind from unraveling.
