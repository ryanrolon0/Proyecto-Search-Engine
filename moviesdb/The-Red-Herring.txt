The Red Herring

 It's 11 surface in the Pacific Ocean sometime in late 1942. A Japanese convoy has been spotted and the U.S.S. Herring is on the prowl. Weeks of wandering aimlessly has given the crew an energy potential that fires more than just torpedoes. With danger all around them, the perplexed Captain and his assortment of quirky seamen somersault from one misadventure into another.
