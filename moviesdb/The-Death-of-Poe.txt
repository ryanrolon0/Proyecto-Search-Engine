The Death of Poe

 In late September 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was bound on a trip to New York City. Mysteriously, he was discovered several days later, raving and incoherent, in a Baltimore gutter. For three days he lay delirious in a hospital (renowned for body snatching) and there he died. To this day, the cause of his death remains a mystery. Mixing authentic recreations of Poe's life and last days with terrifying imagery from his stories, THE DEATH OF POE is a cinematic chronicle of the great writer's final journey into madness and fear.
