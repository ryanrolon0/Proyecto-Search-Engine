Uomo d'acqua dolce

 Antonio and Beatrice are a married couple and she's pregnant. One night she feels like eating artichokes under oil and he hurries to the supermarket to buy them. Unfortunately he's hit on the head by a packet of sugar, loses his memory and vanishes into thin air. He reappears five years later unaware of the time passed but Beatrice has now taken up with another guy, an opera singer, and doesn't want to see him any more. Antonio, however, does not want to give up
