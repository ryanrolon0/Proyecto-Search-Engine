Sexual Pursuit

 Classic 1980's fare, this lighthearted tale involves a bored married couple, Tiffany Blake and Rick Savage, who are experiencing new sexual circumstances involving friends that come to town. Long time acquaintances, Summer Rose and Dino Alexander have relocated to California after residing on the east coast for far too long. Too celebrate their return, Tiffany and Rick host a dinner party. Table conversation revolves around one of Tiffany and Rick's friends and his new career in Porn. The action soon shifts to an upstairs bedroom, where the couples watch one of the tapes and before too long the evening turns into a sensual experience in partner swapping. The next night, after experiencing pangs of regret, the couples cling tightly to their partners. The day after, Rick and Dino do lunch at a sushi bar that is in reality a front for prostitution where Asian beauties Dallas Miko and Kristara Barrington are hookers. The hookers waste no time in doing the fellows for lunch in a whirling free-for-all! With their new found comfort with swapping, that night, the guys have a torrid replay with their wives.
