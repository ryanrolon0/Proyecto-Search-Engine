Scratching the Surface

 Three independent filmmakers volunteer to document the non-profit organization HEART (Health Education Africa Resource Team) throughout AIDS-torn Kenya, chronicling efforts to teach Kenyans how to curtail the spread of AIDS. Instead of the overwhelming despair associated with the impossible task of teaching millions even as they're dying, the filmmakers choose to reveal the people for their inherent character intelligent and hopeful, willing to learn and incorporate the information the volunteers of HEART present to understand and ultimately overcome the deadly disease. Interviews with HEART Team members, Kenyan officials and residents reveal the impact this small, California-based organization has had in just four years, and testimonials inspire the spirit to understand the difference even one person can have in changing lives forever.
