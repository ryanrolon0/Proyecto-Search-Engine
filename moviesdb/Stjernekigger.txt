Stjernekigger

 Stjernekigger (2002) gives us an inside look at the rise of Copenhagen band Swan Lee. Starting in 1998, the film shows us how the band tries to get a record deal with established record companies, receiving only rejections. This triggers internal struggles; one member is fired, another threatens to leave. The clue of the film, more than anything, is how instead of giving up on their dream Swan Lee chose to go the less travelled way success and artistic freedom through a small record company of their own. At the time of writing this, they have succeeded most acclaimed Danish bands, having scored several hits and received several awards.
