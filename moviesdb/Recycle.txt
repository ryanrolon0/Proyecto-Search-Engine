Recycle

 The soft sound of his flute is the first sign of his existence, in that place that occupies memory from make-believe. Mabon's people lived free from the chains of technology... but not for long. The Machines, created by man to clean up the trash and waste dotting the once lush landscape, have grown hungry for something more. When the eager hand of evolution is placed upon them, Mabon's world is forever changed. The Machines start experimenting. Trash and Flesh have come together, all they need to complete their human-machine hybrid is the perfect head. Crystal's not having any of it. The perfect head belongs to her. As leader of the Machine world, she had to sacrifice her love for Mabon - who is earth, air, fire and water combined - and live without him. When the Machines collect Mabon for their final sample and bring him to her dark observation tower, Crystal takes matters into her own hands.
