Rukov - På sporet af den tabte tid

 One of the most outstanding personalities in the Danish film industry is Mogens Rukov, co-writer of Thomas Vinterberg's dogma-film The Celebration (Cannes, 1998, winner of the Jury Price) and head of the Department for Scriptwriting at the Danish Filmschool. Flemming Lyngse has made a film with rather than about Mogens Rukov. This is a film with a moving man - professionally as well as personally.
