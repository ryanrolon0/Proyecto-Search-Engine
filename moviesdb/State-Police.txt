State Police

 When his son is expelled from college, Colonel Clarke, head of the State Police, assigns him to the patrol of Sergeant Dan Prescott as Private Smith. "Smith" disobeys Dan's order and makes a play for his girl Helen Evans. During a shutdown of unprofitable coal mines at Minersburg, the gang of racketeer "Trigger" Magee levies tribute on the miners who are mining coal for their own use. Magee kills Albert Morgan for opposing him, and Dan gets order to arrest Magee and clean up the situation. "Smith" quits the force and becomes involved with the gangsters headquartered at "The Oaks," a notorious resort ran by Helen's brother Jack. The latter double-crosses Magee and is killed by him. Magee is arrested, escapes and makes "Smith" a prisoner and beats him unconscious for refusing to phone his father to call off the police hunt. Miners, led by Joe Palmer and Charlie, organize to clean out the gangsters while Dan's troopers are also closing in.
