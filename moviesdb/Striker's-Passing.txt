Striker's Passing

 A poetic and powerful portrait of the New England harpoon swordfisherman and his fate in the modern world. Centering the film around his father, one of the last swordfish strikers on the East Coast, Mayhew presents a personal documentary sharing rare insight into the beauty and frustration of a life dependent on the sea and its resources, facing extinction in the wake of the current fishing industry's industrial-scale harvesting methods.
