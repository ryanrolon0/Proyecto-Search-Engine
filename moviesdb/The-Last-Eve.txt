The Last Eve

 "The Last Eve" is a film that takes the audience on an emotional adventure through history. In a way never before seen, the story of Eve is shown from front to back. We start in the future and ride all the way back to the loss of all innocence. Our ride through time shows us three greatly contrasting tales that in their own unique ways reveal the dark tragedy at the heart of all romance.
