The Laramie Kid

 When Morley has his own bank robbed, Tom tries to break it up. Mistaken for one of the gang, he is caught and sentenced to a chain gang. His girlfriend Peggy then sets out to prove his innocence. Tom Talbot surrenders himself to Dad Bland, father of the girl he loves, assuming the guilt of a bank holdup, so that the rancher can collect the reward money offered for any of the bandits. This way, Bland can pay off the mortgage held by town banker Jim Morley, who is trying to force Peggy Bland to marry him. Tom is sentenced to five years in prison, but Peggy knows he is innocent. Investigations by Peggy convince her that Morley sent the sheriff pursuing the bandits on a false trail. A fellow prisoner tells Tom that Morley engineered the holdup to cover a cash shortage in the bank. Tom makes a break from the roadgang and hides in Bland's barn. He follows Peggy up Blackrock Canyon and arrives in time to save Peggy from Morley, and the posse rounds up the gang.
