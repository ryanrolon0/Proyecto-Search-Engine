St. Milly

 At the age of 11, Milagros Cohen learns from her Irish Catholic friends that she is "Nothing". Half Jewish, half Puerto Rican, and no religion, Nothing. Her old school Puerto Rican Grandmother helps to hammer this point home. In a desperate effort to fit in and to earn her salvation, Milly sets out to perform one glorious heaven-worthy Miracle.
