The SharkTank Redemption

 Fred Redding, an assistant at Hollywood agency CMA comes before the board, seeking a promotion, and is refused. He tells us the story of his coworker, Randy Tulane, who didn't just do his time at the agency, but used the system for his own purposes and, ultimately, to help his friend, Fred. The SharkTank Redemption is inspired by the classic 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption. In lieu of prison life, SharkTank takes a comic look at life as an everyday office worker; proving that life on the job and life in prison are not as different as one might think.
