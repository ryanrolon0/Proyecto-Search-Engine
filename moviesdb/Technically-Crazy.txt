Technically Crazy

 A sixteen-year-old, bipolar, runaway named Jay breaks into the house of a retired former cop named Bill, just as Bill reaches rock bottom due to his own issues. These two move from distrust to understanding and come to realize that even though they might drive each other crazy, technically or otherwise, they need each other. Together they help fix what's broken in one another.
