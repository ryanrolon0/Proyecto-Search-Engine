The Queen of Depth

 The Sarma exploration project wasn't only the chance to break the world record held by Voronja, but also the first time the team's work was filmed all the way down the cave. First visuals from the depth of more then 1500m. The film is about the victorious adventure of the last expedition to the cave. the struggle, the camp life, underground life and adventure, the injuries, people's relationships, the fun and the difficulty of rope work, ways to find a new cave and more - a documentary 1500m deep. People have always wanted to reach the center of the Earth. There are thousands of caves deeper than 100m, hundreds of caves deeper than 1000m but only a few are deeper than 1500m. In the eyes of every caver, it is a fantasy to visit a cave more than 1000m deep or even more so to take part in the exploration of such a cave, Caves are possibly the last "white spots" on the world's map, the last opportunity to walk, where man's step has never trod or even more so man's eye hasn't seen or recorded it by camera.
