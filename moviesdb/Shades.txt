Shades

 Shades is the bittersweet story of widow, Jan's tangled relationship with her young son, Alan. Alan adores her as only a fatherless boy can. As Jan attempts to move on from the memory of Tommy, (her beloved dead husband), with Callum, (a Capstan smoking, fun-loving shoe salesman), her son tries to thwart her.
