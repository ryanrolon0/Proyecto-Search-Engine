The Fundraiser

 "The Fundraiser" is about a group of misguided, selfish, and generally unlikeable individuals who, for various reasons, have decided to take part in a fundraiser at a generic suburban bowling alley. However, when the event goes horribly awry, an unlikely source steps in to save the day, and everyone has a chance to learn a valuable lesson about helping others... or maybe our hero is just trying to get laid.
