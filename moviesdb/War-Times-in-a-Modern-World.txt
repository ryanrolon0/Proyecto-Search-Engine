War Times in a Modern World

 In a time of advanced technologies, we surround ourselves with entertainments, products, and luxury to avoid reality. This is a satirical piece that observes and criticizes the society which we live in. It is a metaphorical piece where a diner (home) is literally set in the middle of a battlefield, but the people inside the diner doesn't even realize the the fact and just live out their lives in luxury without noticing. It is a statement that we must free ourselves from this bubble of distraction and controlled media and gossip.
