Sunday for Sammy 2004

 Performed Bi-Annually, these are always sell out shows. This show, the third, and the first to be recorded for DVD/Video release, was the best ever, with Jimmy Nail, Tim Healy and Kevin Whatley performing more live Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, AC/DC's Brian Johnson joining in the acting and Singing, as well as stand up comedy from the likes of Brendan Healy and Peter Peverley, The Soup Entertainment company, and many many others. This event alone raised over £80,000 for the Sammy Johnson memorial fund.
