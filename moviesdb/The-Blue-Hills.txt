The Blue Hills

 What does it feel like to lose your way? What if you are both injured and lost? We all know this feeling, but it is rarely put to imagery. The Blue Hills tells the simple story of one man's surreal, lonely memories of making his own way home as he tries to clean up his bike the next day.
