There is something about Christy that does not sit right with Joanne. Joanne's professional life takes a turn when she is asked by an old colleague to act as the on-air crime and justice expert for a local television news show. The first story on which she is to report is the Little Flower Killings, a series of murders of prostitutes. The story has a personal connection to the Kilbourn's as the latest victim, Debbie Morin, was an employee of Joanne's daughter Mieka, who knew nothing about Debbie's past. The lead investigator for the police department on this case is Inspector Philip Millard, Joanne's old partner. As Joanne and Philip investigate the murders, a tragedy occurs associated with the Kilbourn family, this incident which Joanne believes is connected to the Little Flower Killings. Joanne and Philip have to discover the connection to find the killer and the cause of the tragedy.
