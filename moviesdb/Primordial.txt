Primordial

 From a dying planet imploding far away, over 65 million years ago, a comet is born. The comet travels millions of years and trillions of miles to collide with early Earth (already billions of years old) killing many forms of life while giving birth to others. And so begins the evolution of the human being - adapting to survive on inhospitable planet in an expansive universe.
