The Nut Farm

 Bob and Helen decide to move to California and make a fresh start. Bob wants to buy a nut farm, but Helen dreams of being in the movies. While Bob is looking for a farm to buy, Helen is taken in by a group of scam artists who promise to make her a star. Helen's brother Willie tries to prevent her and Bob from losing all their money to the scam artists. Swindler Hamilton Holland induces Betty Brent to take the family fortune and invest in a movie rather than buying the nut-farm as her husband, Bob Brent, wishes to do. Her brother, Willie Barton, is hired to direct the film, a strange desert-drama epic, which bombs at the preview. But Willie saves the day by re-editing it to a comedy.
