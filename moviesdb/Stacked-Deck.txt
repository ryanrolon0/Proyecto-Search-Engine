Stacked Deck

 A dark, smoke filled warehouse is the setting for an after-hours high stakes poker game. Friends, enemies, and strangers are uncovered as the last hands are played, and the stakes rise even higher as the players' pasts are revealed. Who can you read? Who can you trust? All bets are off when the deck is stacked against you.
