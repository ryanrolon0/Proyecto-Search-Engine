 Quantum is the story of a man who disappears. An ex-quantum physicist is struggling to continue his existence in society. The strains of his monotonous job and his crumbling relationship with his wife drive him back towards his secret past. With the help of the mysterious Professor, he is able to reconstruct the machine that once before led to his downfall. Quantum is the story of a man who disappears. SAM, an ex-quantum physicist is struggling to continue existing in society. His accounting job is monotonous and boring. Piles of paper leads to piles of paper leads to piles of paper. His marriage is crumbling around him and his wife, YVONNE, is in the first stages of an affair. But SAM notices none of this. Instead he is drawn deeper into his secret past by the sinister PROFESSOR. With his help they reconstruct the machine that once led to SAM's downfall and possibly his future annihilation. It is loosely based on the theories and philosophical debates that surround quantum physics. Particularly the following two notions; the idea that electrons can flit in and out of time and space, their existence somehow determined by their being observed, and that a photon can exist in two places at the same time. This element of science will sit as the backdrop to the more human element of the story. This is the idea that people flit in and out of our lives and we are usually unable to tell exactly when their existence came to affect us and when that influence ceases to exist. Also that we are all made up of a variation of characteristics and that these can run contrary to each other creating elements of duality within our personality.
