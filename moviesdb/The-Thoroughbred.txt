The Thoroughbred

 Bob Beemis comes to New York City hoping to get his family entrenched in the high-society circuit, but only succeeds in making friends with one person in the social whirl, Archie de Rennsaler. They party with a couple of chorus girls and Bob falls in love with one of them. His uncle arrives from the West to check out his progress, finds there has been none, and closes out his bank account. What's a poor rich-boy do do? Well, he could enter his horse in a really, really Big Race.
