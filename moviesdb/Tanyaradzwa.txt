Tanyaradzwa

 Tanyaradzwa (Kudakwashe Maradzika) is an intelligent, outgoing girl from a rich, loving family. Life seems perfect until one night, during dinner, her nine-month secret is revealed with the birth of a boy. Feeling betrayed, her parents dredge out old skeletons and take out their frustration on each other. Unable to bear the guilt of destroying her family, Tanya flees to find the baby's father, no-good playboy, Marlon. Her only friend is Marlon's tough-talking cousin Ajira, who encourages her to sell her body, but not her soul, to survive. Family, friendship, loyalty and social morality show their true colors during this kaleidoscopic journey of a naive, desperate and too-young mother
