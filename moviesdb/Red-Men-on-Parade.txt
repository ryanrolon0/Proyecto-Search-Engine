Red Men on Parade

 This Traveltalk entry visits a large intertribal meeting of American Indians from all over the western United States. Members of about 30 tribes attended the event, which lasts several days. Attendees perform various tribal ceremonies, demonstrate their skills at crafts (pottery, weaving, doll making), and participate in rodeo events.
