Tall in the Trap

 Jerry is wanted by a local Western town for cheese theft; the cheese owner and the Sherriff are fed up with them. Along comes Tom, who is recruited by the Sherriff to dispose of Jerry, though Jerry has his usual bag of tricks for Tom. The western town of Dry Gulch is battling Jerry, the notorious cheese rustler. He brazenly saws off wedges of the cheese in the window of the general store (which changes the designation from cheddar to swiss as the cheese is shot full of holes). Sheriff Mutt Dillin calls for "the fastest trap in the west"; alas, he gets Tom, who despite his Paladin-like "Have trap, will travel" card, is even more inept than usual.
