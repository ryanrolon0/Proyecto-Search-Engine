Tampa Jai Alai

 Based on a true story, Tampa Jai Alai examines the fall of Jai Alai in America from its golden age in the late-seventies until it's downfall in the eighties. The film follows Javier Arriaga, a Basque player who is the reigning champion, as he tries to win the Triple Crown of Jai Alai. His plans are derailed when Mikey Carson, the first great American Jai Alai player joins the roster and all the attention and accolades are focused on him. Javier leads a nation-wide strike to protest the management's plans to exploit Mikey and his success to transform Jai Alai into the next great American sport. Tensions finally come to a head when Mikey and Javier compete against each other in the 1982 Triple Crown tournament.
