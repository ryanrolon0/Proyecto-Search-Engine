Stolen Freedom

 Jackson was born free, then unlawfully enslaved, separated from his wife and children and forced to fight for the Confederate Army during the Civil War. And while Jackson didn't know how he was going to rescue his family from slavery, he knew he'd either be successful or die trying. Though he escaped from his army captors, Jackson knew he would never be truly free until he helped his family get their...freedom.
