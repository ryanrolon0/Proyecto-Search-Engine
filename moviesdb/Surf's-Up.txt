Surf's Up

 This story follows a teenage rock hopper penguin named Cody Maverick from his hometown of Shiverpool, Antarctica, where all of the other penguins think he's nothing but a surfing fool, to the "Big Z Memorial Surf Off" on Pen Gu Island. Young Cody is determined to win the most important competition in the world of penguin surfing in honor of "Big Z," a deceased surfing legend whom he has idolized since childhood. But the waves in Pen Gu are different than in Shiverpool, and the competition is steep. The current champ, egotistical Tank Evans, isn't just about to let this little penguin knock him from first place without a fight. When Cody wipes out and encounters Geek, a recluse aging former surfer, living in the jungle, he learns some important lessons about life and surfing, and even teaches Geek a thing or two. Cody Maverick is a penguin who has a passion for surfing. Hitching a ride to Pen Gu Island, Cody and his chicken friend, Joe attempt to participate in the Big Z Memorial Surf Off. This documentary tracks his steps from leaving his home, training with Big Z and attempting the big challenge. The reality/documentary follows Cody Maverick, a teenage Royal Penguin, and his friend Chicken Joe, as Cody leaves his hometown of Shiverpool, Antarctica, to participate in "Big Z Memorial Surf Off" competition commemorating deceased surfing star Big Z on Pen Gu Island. A stylistically daring CGI feature, "Surf's Up" is based on the groundbreaking revelation that surfing was actually invented by penguins. In the film, a documentary crew will take audiences behind the scenes and onto the waves during the most competitive, heartbreaking and dangerous display of surfing known to man, the Penguin World Surfing Championship.
