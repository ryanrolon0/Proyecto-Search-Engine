The Foreigners

 The unconventional and decidedly quirky narrative follows the lives of six foreigners in the small Turkish town of Goreme, where each winds his or her way in and out of the surrounding landscape and culture. Some of the foreigners find their way home, but for an unsuspecting few, Goreme becomes their place of destiny in the universe.
