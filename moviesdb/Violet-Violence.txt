Violet Violence

 Two low-track prostitutes from the streets of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside live deep within a world of drugs, abuse and despair. The girls are taken hostage by a hunter in a black pickup and driven to a remote forest. After enduring a terrifying ordeal, they are shocked to discover what finally awaits them deep within the woods.
