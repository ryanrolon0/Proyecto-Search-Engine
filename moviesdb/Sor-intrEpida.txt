 Dominique Blanchar (billed as Dominique Blanchard in the American-released print) gives up her profession as a singer, with a promising career,to become a nun, over the protestations and objections of her wealthy family. She becomes a Sister in a hospital ward, and her unconventional methods of getting something done proves disconcerting to her superiors at first, but they discover her to be truly noble. To help a dying patient she "moves" Christmas up by two weeks, and in order for the hospital to get much-needed funds, she makes some records and sends the proceeds anonymously to the hospital. Later, as a Mother Superior, she volunteers to go to a leper colony in India, where she dies while serving others.
