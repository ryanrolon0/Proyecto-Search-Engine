Screen Actors

 This short tries to show that in some ways, the actors we see in the movies are just like us. They have mortgages to pay and families to raise. They also have interests and businesses not related to acting. Performers' faces are shown on the screen as the narrator tells of their non-show-business activities. Most of them are shown in quick excerpts from unidentified films. A few, such as 'Reginald Denny (I)' (qv), 'Gail Patrick' (qv), and 'Dan Duryea' (qv) are shown engaging in their outside pursuits.
