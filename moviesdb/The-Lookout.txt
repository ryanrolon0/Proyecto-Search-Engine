The Lookout

 An admired high school hockey player with a bright future foolishly takes a drive in the night with his girlfriend and two other friends with his headlights off with devastating results. The former athlete is left with a brain injury that prevents him from remembering many things for extended periods of time. To compensate, he keeps notes in a small notebook to aid him in remembering what he is to do. He also lives with a blind friend who aids him. Obviously, with the mental incapacitation, he is unable to have meaningful work. Thus he works as a night cleaning man in a bank. It is there he comes under the scrutiny of a gang planning to rob the bank. The leader befriends him and gets him involved with a young woman who further reels him in. After they get close and after reeling him in with his own failures, the bank plan unfolds. Confused but wanting to escape his current existence, he initially goes along with the scheme. After realizing he is being used, he attempts to stop the robbery, which of course immediately goes awry. Since reckless driving 'to impress them' killed Chris Pratt's passengers and left him a memory-impaired half-wit, he lives with resourceful blind Lewis, takes a course and hopes against hope for promotion from cleaner to teller in a bank. Cool Gary Spargo recruits Chris, whom he convinces to be getting such a bad deal the world owes him, as look-out to help his violent gang rob the local bank branch. After a promise he may try out as teller, Chris wants to bail out, but is now forced to betray his real friends and see some hurt. After a shoot-out, surprises follow for Chris, he physically got away with the loot, and Gary, who is confident to roll over him easily again, even gun-wounded.
