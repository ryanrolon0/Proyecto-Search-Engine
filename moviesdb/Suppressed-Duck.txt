Suppressed Duck

 Daffy Duck goes hunting grizzly bear in a forest but is not allowed by the Game Commissioner to cross the line separating him from the bears. One particular bear teases Daffy by sticking out its tongue. In response, Daffy fires at the bear, but his bullet is stopped dead at the boundary line. Daffy tries to tunnel over to the bears' side and surfaces inside a volatile explosives barn!
