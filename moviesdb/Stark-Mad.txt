Stark Mad

 A group of people from the United States sail on a yacht down to Caracas in search of the captain's missing son. Soon they are lost in the wilds of Central America, encounter many terrors in the jungle (including an ape that is trained-to-kill), one of the party is murdered by something or someone close to the searchers.
