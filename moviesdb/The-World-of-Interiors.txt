The World of Interiors

 A man who lives alone in a flat gets a phone call and tells the caller that he's "just about to go out." He grabs an umbrella, gets outside, sees bight sun and heads back inside to change our of his sweater. He discovers holes in his trouser pockets, looks to mend them, spills some paint when he opens the storage closet, decides to paint the walls with the spilled paint, repositions his furniture, and sees mites in his carpets. Will he ever step outside of his world of interiors?
