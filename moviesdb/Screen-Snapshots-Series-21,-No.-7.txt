Screen Snapshots Series 21, No. 7

 Opens with Janet Blair and a squadron of Air Corps men singing "Nothing Can Stop the Army, Now." Then cuts to a burlesque court-martial scene of Charlie McCarthy, who is being defended by Lieutenant James Stewart as his counsel(and Edgar Bergen as his voice), with Major Lynn S. Chapman of the West Coast Air Corps Training Center, as the presiding judge.
