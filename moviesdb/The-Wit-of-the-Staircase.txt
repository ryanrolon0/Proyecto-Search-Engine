The Wit of the Staircase

 On September 16 2007, Jim Rigney, whose pen name was Robert Jordan, the author of The Wheel of Time series, died in Charleston, SC. He was America's highest selling fantasy writer, and was in the middle of writing his final book in the series. In addition, he wrote historical novels set during the revolutionary war, he also wrote additional books for the iconic Conan the Barbarian series. The Wit of the Staircase" will focus on Robert Jordan's life - beginning with the writer's early years, growing up in Charleston, his tours of duty in Vietnam, his relationship with his wife and step-son, the creation of The Wheel of Time series and its enormous success; as well as his contributions to the fantasy genre; which has undergone a popular resurgence in the past decade. The filmmakers are especially well positioned to show the life of this man who was our friend and colleague for many years. The project will be comprised of new interviews with Jordan's family and friends. We will use photographs obtained from his family, as well as Footage shot by fans and family members. We will secure interviews with literary contemporaries, family members, friends, assistants, and Brandon Sanderson the author chosen to complete the final book in The Wheel of Time series.
