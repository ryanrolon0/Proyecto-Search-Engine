Stills of the Movement

 Dr. Martin Luther King understood well the importance of documenting the Civil Rights Movement. There was one photojournalist that he trusted above all others. This film documents the civil rights-era photography of one of the most prolific photojournalists of the 20th century - Flip Schulke. Flip Schulke was one of the most prolific photojournalists of the 20th Century. He was a pioneering underwater photographer accompanying Jacques Cousteau on expeditions. Flip was one of the few elite photographers invited by NASA to document space flight. He took pictures of the Berlin wall as it was going up, and returned some 27 years later to document its fall. But many of his colleagues and friends feel Flip's most important work was done during the civil rights struggles in the 1960's. Stills of the Movement is a film that explores Flip's work during this time. Family, friends and colleagues who knew Flip best are interviewed about his motivations as a photojournalist. Viewers will learn about his experiences as a youth and how those formative years shaped his world view. This film also explores the importance that media played in the Civil Rights Movement. Former and current professional journalists as well as academics and civil rights leaders explain the impact photojournalism had in the 60's. Flip's work was some of the best.
