The Princess Stallion

 When her divorced mother dies, Sarah, a 15 year old Californian girl, is sent to live with her father on his farm in the Scottish highlands. There she meets a hermit (Fergus) who looks after sick and injured animals and destroys any traps set by hunters. One day she sees a white stallion in the fog. Her father doesn't believe that the horse is real, and that Fergus is having too big an influence on her. But the poachers are after the beautiful horse.
