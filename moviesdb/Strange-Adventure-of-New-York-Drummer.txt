Strange Adventure of New York Drummer

 "This commercial traveler has evidently had a wet day judging from the strange things he sees at his hotel. The hall boy shows him to his room, puts down his grips, and then disappears through the ceiling. Drummer pushes button five times for a drink, and waiter appears through the floor. Drummer turns to sit down on the bed it disappears. He fights with the waiter, is overcome, and waiter locks him in a trunk and sits on it. After a while he opens the trunk; behold, it's empty. Drummer appears mysteriously, picks up a big book, hits waiter on head, and drives him through the floor. Drummer dances in delirious glee."
