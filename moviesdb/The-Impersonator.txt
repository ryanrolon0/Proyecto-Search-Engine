The Impersonator

 In a small English town a schoolmistress meets a sergeant from the nearby U.S. airforce base and they decide on a date. When they miss each other at a cafe as arranged, a train of events is set in motion culminating in the murder of a woman in the local park, and things look bad for the American.
