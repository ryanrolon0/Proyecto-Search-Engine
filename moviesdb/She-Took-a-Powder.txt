She Took a Powder

 This Columbia "All Star Comedy" short begins with a mongrel dog telling his tale of woe; in his previous life as a human, prior to reincarnation as a dog, he married hypochondriac, always ill Vera Vageu, and one day he and a friend set out to convince her she wasn't sick. They tried a number of cures, but they both pass away, and Vera is still a pill-head. The dog is very happy and contented with his new life until a new dog comes up and starts whining in Vera's voice.
