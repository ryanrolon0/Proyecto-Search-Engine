The Bride & The Grooms

 A woman accidentally gets engaged to four men at the same time. Taylor Green is so nice - too nice for her own good. She proposes to her distracted boyfriend, who reflexively says "OK." She thinks they are engaged, and he has no idea. When she tells her other three best guy friends about the wedding, they think she is proposing to them. So four guys end up jockeying for position at the altar as the bride-to-be walks down the aisle. Here comes the bride ... who is the groom?
