Waiting for Woody Allen

 Waiting for Woody Allen, a parody of Samuel Beckett's classic, Waiting for Godot, is a tragic comedy about two quarrelsome Hasidic men, Mendel and Yossel. Disillusioned with religion, therapy and their own friendship, they wait on a bench in Central Park for Woody Allen to come and give meaning to their lives.
