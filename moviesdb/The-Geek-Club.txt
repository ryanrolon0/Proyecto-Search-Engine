The Geek Club

 On their first day of Junior High, Josh, Austin and J.J. find out what it means to be bullied. Determined to be thought of as cool, they band together and form "The Geek Club." This takes them on numerous adventures through snake museums, hospitals and retirement homes, testing the boys' courage and strengthening their friendship. Josh, Austin, JJ and Michael enter junior high believing that they are cool. Soon they realize that their definition of 'cool' differs greatly from that of their classmates. Josh, born with spina bifida, just wants to be treated like everyone else, but no-one seems to be able to see past his wheelchair. Austin, a bumbling bowling enthusiast, might as well have 'kick me' permanently tattooed on his back. JJ dreams of super heroes, girls, and zombies. Michael wants to fit in with the cool crowd and win his older brother's approval, regardless of what it means to his old friends. When harassed by Ron, the school bully, they band together to form 'The Geek Club'.
