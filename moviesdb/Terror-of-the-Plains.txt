Terror of the Plains

 The man that framed Tom Lansing's father for murder is at a ghost town where no one is allowed in or out. Tom gets in by posing as an escaping outlaw with his sidekick Banty posing as the Sheriff that is chasing him. Tom learns that the boss Cramer is the man he is after but there is trouble when Banty later gets caught. Cramer holds a kangaroo court planning to kill Banty if he doesn't tell who his confederate is.
