The Steeplechase

 Mickey is set to ride Thunderbolt in the big race; his owner, the Colonel, has bet everything. But the stable-hands goof off and incapacitate the horse. In desperation, Mickey rents a horse costume and puts the stable-hands inside. They manage to eventually clear the hurdles, but get hung up on one near a beehive; the bees propel them to victory.
