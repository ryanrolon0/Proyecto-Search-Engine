Scomparsa

 A first time actress is playing the role of a prostitute in a low budget movie. As written in the script, she enters the first car that stops in front of her... but the driver is not a crew member, it's a man looking for a real prostitute. Her nightmare begins. She has tough problems in convincing this man and other people that she's just an actress. Beatrice thinks about playing a role and is mistaken for a prostitute. Dante thinks about taking on a prostitute who, instead, is a walk-on. And the walk-on walks out down in a descent to the underworld that she will find hard to escape from.
