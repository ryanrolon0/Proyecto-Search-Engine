Students Turn for a Change

 Students Turn For A Change is a documentary film about Project 540, a revolutionary high school civic engagement initiative funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts. From the perspective of young people, the film looks at issues most important to them, and at the role of high schools as "practice grounds" for democracy. Over 140,000 students in 230 schools in 15 different states participated in Project 540 during its first year, 2002-2003. Filmed by the student participants, Students Turn For A Change introduces the aims and purposes of Project 540, and presents a series of vignettes that features seven schools nationwide as they struggle with youth civic engagement. The narrative is personalized by following several participating students as "characters."
