The Problem with Fiber Optics

 Set in a hyper-realistic 1961, Sheldon Bemis is an introverted 30-year-old fountain boy whose lack of sexual experience has prevented him from asking out Josephine Callaway, the object of his desire. One day, Sheldon receives an unexpected visit from a door-to-door saleswoman, offering him the opportunity to purchase a memory implant of his choice in exchange for a memory of his own. In an effort to boost his confidence, he procures someone else'e memory of a sex with a seemingly random woman, which ends up having several shockingly nightmarish side effects that spin his otherwise tiresome life into a chaotic mess.
