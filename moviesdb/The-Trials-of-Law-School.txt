The Trials of Law School

 The Trials of Law School is a fascinating film that follows seven students, with different backgrounds and expectations, through their grueling first year of law school as they encounter a new curriculum, a new language and a new way of life. The film captures the stress and emotion, both inside the classroom and out, as they try to juggle family and relationships with school commitments. The pressure builds as their grades come down to one final exam at the end of the semester, which for many students, determines their immediate career future.
