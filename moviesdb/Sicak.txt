Sicak

 They were fellow travelers...Yusuf was working for a company that brought out sunken ship wrecks and sold them. His beautiful wife, Meryem, is a modest teacher giving private lessons and she is pregnant for two months now. They were yet not aware that this short trip they started for the wreck ship project at opens of Bozcaada island was about to turn into a nightmare because of a letter left by a woman whom they did not know at all. Around the same hours, poor Adem, who is an old soldier and just learned that his wife ran away and was hopelessly calling to ask for help from his old diver friend Niko, the only person he knew on that island, is at the edge of insanity. The sun goes down, the sky is thorn apart and when that time arrives destiny makes its sharers gather up. That night death was considered for one of these whose lives intercepted. And a hell like glow for those left behind.
