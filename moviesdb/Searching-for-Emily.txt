Searching for Emily

 Searching For Emily is a surprisingly fun romp through history. Quirky, real and beautiful, this feature length documentary follows the entertaining creative process of portrait artist Manon Elder as she collaborates with Royal BC Museum curator Kathryn Bridge to redefine the image of iconic Canadian author and artist Emily Carr (1871-1945). Searching For Emily follows Elder's artistic process, from first inspiration to final execution, and the developing friendship of discovery between Elder and Bridge. It culminates with the journey of the artist to the mystical islands of Haida Gwaii. Following Emily Carr's footsteps through the wilderness, a story of discovery, inspiration and understanding is driven home. Searching For Emily is the portal for us all to understand and love Emily Carr.
