Wall of Shadows

 Three unnamed prisoners are plugged into computers and forced to look at a wall of screens. The prisoners name one object after the other as the slides change. A mysterious woman comes into the room and releases one of the prisoners. He must choose which world he believes is real, and risk everything on the decision.
