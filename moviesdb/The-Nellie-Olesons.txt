The Nellie Olesons

 Named after the blonde, bratty, gay icon from "Little House on the Prairie", the Nellie Olesons exploded onto the New York comedy scene in 1993 with their wicked sense of humor and envelope pushing antics. This award winning video is comprised of classic sketches from their 1996 show, "Pulp Nellie", including "Menorah, the Jewish Madonna", "Miss Cajun Inbred, Connie Slocum", "Disney Girls", "Lesbian Signer", "Mrs. Porn Goes Shopping" as well as spoofs and satires of Calvin Klein commercials, gay circuit queens and horny porn girls. The final sketch, "CK Nellie" include a rare appearance by Nellie Oleson herself, Alison Arngrim.
