Silver Circle

 At the center of corruption is the Federal Reserve who has gained enormous amounts of control over America's economy, with disastrous effects beginning to show. Standing opposite, is the band of Rebels who have vowed to take back the freedom they once knew...and they won't go down without a fight. Monetary mayhem. Explosions. Romance. Silver Circle plans to take liberty filmmaking to a whole other level.
