The Janitor's Office

 Five teenagers are thrown together in the hallways of their high school while trying to escape a killer that is on the loose. With all the doors dead bolted and windows unbreakable, the only solace they can find is in the walls of the janitor's office. They all try desperately to escape, but with no power, cell phones or trust, they need to find a way out before they begin turning one another and the killer tracks them down.
