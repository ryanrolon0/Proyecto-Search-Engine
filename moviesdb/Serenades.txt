Serenades

 1890, Central Australia. On a Christian mission at the edge of the desert, a girl is born of an Aboriginal mother and an Afghan father. A dark skinned, green eyed, forbidden beauty - she is a reluctant traveler between the worlds of her parents. This is the story of Jila. Conceived against her mother's will, born between worlds, abandoned by love, cheated by death, removed from her faith and from her place.
