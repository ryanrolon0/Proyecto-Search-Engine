Song of Stone

 Song of Stone is an experimental animated film about traditions, human cruelty, and repression of women. A metaphorical narrative told through watercolor animation, Song of Stone explores a fictitious city surrounded by a high, stone wall. The source of these stones is surprising and sinister.
