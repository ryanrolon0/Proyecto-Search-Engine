 Finding love in rural Australia is hard enough for any man. For an eccentric old farmer, whose only social interaction has been with a motley bunch of farm animals, it is just about impossible. Single White Farmer is the story of Poley, a man with his own way of doing things. When he finally gets a telephone call in response to his lonely-hearts ad, Poley will go all out to impress.
