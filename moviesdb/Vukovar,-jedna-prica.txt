Vukovar, jedna prica

 This movie describes the violent break-up of former Yugoslavia from the Serbian point of view, using the story of ethnicly mixed couple in war-torn city of Vukovar as metaphore. 1989 Berlin wall falls, and amidst this hope, Ana and Toma marry. Friends since childhood, she is a Croat, he a Serb. Their parents help them build a house. But, the wedding celebration is interrupted by demonstrators from three ethnic and national contingents. Toma is drafted into the Yugoslav army; Ana, pregnant, watches civil war slowly engulf her city. Threats painted on walls, intimidation, shootings, then tanks and rockets. Within a year, destruction reaches every aspect of their lives. Soundtrack lyrics underscore the ironies, intimate enmity, and stubborn friendships of civil war.
