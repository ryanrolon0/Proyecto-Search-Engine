Revelation 13

 Documents how Ryan Navel, a PHD student, stole a sample of Jesus Christ's DNA that was extracted from the Talpiot Tomb in Jerusalem. As Ryan endeavors to clone the "perfect child," his friends attempt to stop him in fear that he may be creating the Antichrist. As the religious implications become apparent, the struggle between Ryan and his friends mirror that of historical biblical prophesies.
