 Brandon, a restless lonely boy, refuses to be pacified by his caring grandfather, so he ventures outside to meet with the new neighbor girl. She teaches him to play and laugh, and introduces him to a strange alien creature... but will this same creature - which seems to be filling him with youthful zest - simultaneously drain the life from his elderly grandpa?
