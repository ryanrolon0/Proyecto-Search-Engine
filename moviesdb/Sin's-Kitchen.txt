Sin's Kitchen

 In the Mojave desert, fate brings together a drifter, an unfaithful wife, a wealthy cruiser, a mobster, his muscle, their captive, two bounty hunters, and six Cal Tech students going to Texas in an RV. After too much alcohol the first night on the road, one of the grad students discloses he's made a scientific breakthrough that will bring him fame and wealth, but he hasn't turned in the research disc yet. The drifter and the wife talk at a desert tavern, and sex is in the air. The mobsters stop for a beer after taking care of some business, and the bounty hunters are chasing someone. Does anyone get out of the Mojave, "sin's kitchen," alive?
