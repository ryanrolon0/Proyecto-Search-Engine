Prison Farm

 Disregarding the advice if her friends and against her own better judgment, working girl Jean Forest keeps company with Larry Harrison, a small-time hoodlum, helps him out of jams he gets in and even shares her money with him. When he suggests they elope to Canada, she gives up her job, not knowing that he has just committed a holdup in which a man has been killed. On the way, they are arrested for a minor offense and Harrison, hoping to hide out on the local prison farm, pleads guilty and both are sent there. The local prison farm turns out to be a backward and brutal penal colony, and the only person in the camp that Jean can turn to for help is Roi Conrad, the camp doctor who is crusading for reforms at the farm-camp.
