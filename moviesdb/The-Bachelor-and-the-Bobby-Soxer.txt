The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer

 Teenaged Susan Turner, with a severe crush on playboy artist Richard Nugent, sneaks into his apartment to model for him and is found there by her sister Judge Margaret Turner. Threatened with jail, Nugent agrees to date Susan until the crush abates. He counters Susan's comic false sophistication by even more comic put-on teenage mannerisms, with a slapstick climax. A teen-age girl becomes infatuated with an artist, a man many years older than she. Her older sister,a Judge, convinces the artist that the only way to cure the young girl's infatuation is for him to take her out every night for a week. The sister's powers of persuasion are enhanced by the fact the girl had sneaked, uninvited, into his apartment to model for him, and she takes a dim view of 40-year-old men having teen-age girls in his apartment, so it's either date the quail or go to jail.
