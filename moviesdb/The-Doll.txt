The Doll

 Clair, a doll, is the toy-makers most precious creation. For many years she's sat in the same corner of her maker's workshop; the only place she's ever known. One day, Clair discovers that there is a world beyond this room; a world she desires so strongly to reach. This is a world of color and light...a light that breathes life into her. But how can she escape her maker's world when he is always there, always watching her. A story about dreaming beyond all possibilities, escaping the confinements of the life you were told to lead, and becoming who you desire to be.
