The Prince of Porn

 Phil Prince was a director of rather sleazy bondage and discipline films in the New York of the late 1970's and early 80's. As the editor of some of these films, Brian O'Hara became acquainted with Prince and gained his consent for a filmed interview. Outtakes from Phil's films intercut with his ruminations on the porn world circa 1984.
