Scab!

 'Once a scab, always a scab. They should have an S stamped on their forehead to let everyone know what they did.' Such is the venom that still exists towards those that broke the miners' strike of 1984 in Britain. It is an issue that has divided entire communities, broke apart once close families, emotions so raw that to this day raising the name of a scab provokes vicious anger. This documentary mixes interview material with experimental imagery to create a sense of the rage, of the animosity, of why it is they shall never forgive.
