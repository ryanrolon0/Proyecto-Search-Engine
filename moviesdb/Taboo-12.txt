Taboo 12

 Our heroine has come to the U.S. from France, curious about the American sexual mores. She ventures into a sex club and winds up going home with a mysterious suitor, only to find herself ensconced in a vast sumptuous mansion where she envisions great sex and a fabulous place to live. The sex is more wicked than anyone could have ever imagined -- and a little too wicked even for her casual European sensibilities. She is rescued by a housekeeper who turns out to be as wicked as her man.
