Teen Travel Notes

 Malls, cellphones, shopping? BOOOOORING! At least that's what Gabi and Lili say. These are fearless teenage girls with an unquenchable thirst for real adventure. Join them as they turn the world into their classroom and have more fun than most teenagers can imagine. They TRAVEL. Their friends, their nutty chaperon, and their cameraman can barely keep up with them as they explore the world's most interesting vacation and adventure destinations.
