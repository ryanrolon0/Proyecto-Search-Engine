Tomorrow's Mexico

 Post-World War II Mexico is shown as struggling to become a leader in South and North American affairs, while highlights of its history, a blend of revolutions and fiery elections is shown. It also studies the people of the country, with its old-world atmosphere and cultures, but most of the footage is devoted to its current (1946) political scene. Prominent government officials and leaders, such as Lazaro Cardenas, Ezequiel Padilla, and Manuel Avila Camacho are shown.
