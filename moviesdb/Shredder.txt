Shredder

 Shredder is the first feature-length film by Cody Clarke. It was shot over the course of twenty days on a minuscule budget of $2,300-- $735 of which was raised through donations on Kickstarter. All scenes were filmed in the actual NYC apartments of its cast, using natural light and a Canon T2i camera. Drawing from such influences as Chantal Akerman, Vincent Gallo, and John Cassavettes, Cody has crafted a stark, atmospheric work that stands out as a postmodern take on the conventional 'teen film'. He also stars in the lead role as Travis, a High School senior who has fallen out of love with writing comedy songs on guitar and in love with practicing heavy metal. Through a fly-on-the-wall filmmaking approach in which static shots are utilized exclusively, we follow Travis' ups and downs with friends, love interests, and his instrument. Shredder was completed in November 2010 and is currently seeking distribution. It will begin showing at festivals nationwide starting in Spring 2011. Cody is currently in pre-production on his second feature film.
