Wanted -- A Master

 A stray dog (whose thoughts are voiced by the narrator) looking for food goes into the city. The dog learns that the city plans to round up all stray dogs after 3 p.m. that day to be killed at the pound. With only a few hours left, the dog travels from neighborhood to neighborhood, attempting to endear himself to someone willing to take him in and save him before the deadline.
