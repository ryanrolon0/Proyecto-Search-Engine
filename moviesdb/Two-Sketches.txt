Two Sketches

 An informal examination of the reciprocal relationship between artist and subject. It is also a love story, or a love scene. One artist sketches the other, literally, on paper. The other 'sketches' her on camera. Together, they illuminate the details they see in each other and examine our means of looking at and preserving the things we see as important or beautiful.
