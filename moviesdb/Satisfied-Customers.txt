Satisfied Customers

 Heckle and Jeckle, the talking Magpies, are running rampant and causing much havoc in a supermarket mush to the dismay of the proprietor. Seveal wild chase ensue, with the store owner on the short end of most of them, until all three are caught inside of a giant soap bubble and carried skyward. The bubble bursts, and H & J are returned to the cartoonist's inkwell.
