The Art Recyclist

 Where do paintings go when they're no longer loved? What happens to dead art? This super short explores how one artist recycles them. Like an old master, he creates a new painting right over the old one. It's not only cheaper than buying new frames and canvases, it's planet friendly. Recycled art comes with a soul. Underneath a refurbished piece, there's a history and a life that lives on. Shot with a mobile phone and an old video cam, this movie--at one minute--will entertain you while it honors the most precious resource
