Toul omry

 For Rami, all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds, as long as he keeps to himself. But when his longtime lover leaves him to marry a woman and his best friends drift away, he comes face to face with the harsh realities of life as a gay man in Egypt. Against the backdrop of the choreographed crackdown on gay men and the notorious Queen Boat arrests of 2001, he plunges into a world of loveless friendships and spirals downwards to his ultimate downfall. Maher Sabry's film Toul Omri, aka "All My Life" graphically details the story of 26-year-old Rami, a gay man, an accountant and dance student living in Cairo, Egypt. His boyfriend, Waleed, dumbs him in order to get married to a woman. His best girlfriend Dalia leaves Egypt for San Francisco to finish her Ph.D. and escapes the new conservative atmosphere. And his pal Kareem, a successful doctor, is pressuring him to be more involved in the city's semi-underground gay community. Kareem is almost arrested in a police raid on a floating discotheque called the Queen Boat (based on an actual incident in 2001, which catalyzed gay Egyptians and a variety of international human rights organizations into action.) Rami's two neighbors Ahmad and Mina watch him from a distant. Ahmad, a devout Muslim man living next-door from Rami, tries to quell his longing for women, and Mina, a teenager who lives across the way, has a crush on Rami and lives unhappily closeted life with his strict Christian mother. As Rami pursues his own romantic path he goes through one-night stands with closet cases and fetishizing tourists. When he meets Atef, a poor uninhabited waiter who moved to the city, Rami has to make a decision either to pursue his relationship with Atef or be pressured by class differences.
