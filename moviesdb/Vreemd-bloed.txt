Vreemd bloed

 The youngest member of a family of butchers is born on Christmas Eve, 1960. He too will be a butcher. His father is a butcher, just like his grandfather, and just as his elder brothers Cor, Arie and Bolle are destined to be butchers. But Jere is different; he's always laughing and singing and consequently always provoking his father. So Moemoe, his grandmother, decides to protect him from both his meaty fate and the ugly male traits in his butchering family.
