Safehouse

 Award-winning writer/director Ryan Braund delivers an explosive, action-packed feature film debut with 'Safehouse', an independent British sci-fi/action film following four small-time criminals who are cornered into their hideout by the police after stealing a safe full of money. However, instead of arresting them, the police seize this opportunity to test a new, high-tech weapon on them - an unstoppable killing machine. Set within old, decaying warehouses in a remote part of town, these humble thugs are less than prepared for the onslaught of bullets, projectiles and other high-tech tricks this monster can throw at them. Our lead, 'Karl', is determined to fight back against the unknown, despite risking never seeing his daughter again. One by one our 'lab rats' are caught in the cross-hairs as the villainous law enforcement demonstrate what the robot can do. The only things keeping the thieves alive are a police radio interceptor... and an arsenal of weapons.
