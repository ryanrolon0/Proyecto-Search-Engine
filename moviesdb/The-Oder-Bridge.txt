The Oder Bridge

 The film revolves around the complicated German Polish relations viewed through the eyes of an American physicist of Polish origin, living and working in Berlin. He crossed the German Polish border in Frankfurt Oder more than 30 times and conducted a type of field research on society's climate both in Germany and in Poland. While the protagonist saunters through the 2 cities on both sides of the river Oder we hear German and Polish voices, which in fragmented way represent the German and Polish perspectives. The protagonist draws an historical analysis and a conclusion also with concern to his identity. So the only possible place for him seems to be on the bridge because he can set, metaphorically speaking, neither one foot on the right nor one foot on the left bank of the river.
