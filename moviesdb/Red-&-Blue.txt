Red & Blue

 Each day two little balloons hold a race. The protagonist, Blue, is quiet and soft spoken. He loves to race even though he isn't fast, and never wins. The antagonist, RED, is a bully. RED wins every race and constantly picks on Blue. Blue still loves to race. He tries to be RED's friend, but the bullying continues. Blue finally decides not to race anymore and flies away. As he is flying away, he learns about himself, and quite by accident, how to fly much faster.
