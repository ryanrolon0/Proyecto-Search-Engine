Stranger Than Fiction, #69

 This short opens featuring a 19-year-old boy who is seven feet three inches tall and a cadet at a military college. It then jumps to the bizarre and oddly-constructed home of Bouck White, a Harvard grad, whose castle home in upstate New York is a patchwork of masonry without any rhyme or reason. Then Koroseal, a rubber-like substance made from limestone, coke and salt is examined, and the audience learns that the material can be made into dresses and beach-wear, and has unlimited possibilities. A rooster who jumps for corn kernels and molds that make weird faces in pumpkins winds up the one-reeler.
