Undone

 A drifting man struggles to pull objects from the rolling sea below him and scrambles to keep the objects from slipping through his fingers. A stop-motion animation using textured and tactile materials, as well as personal imagery, that represents the progression of the Alzheimer's disease in unique, poetic and visual way. Inspired by the filmmaker's grandfather.
