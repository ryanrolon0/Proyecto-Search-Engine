Samba em Brasília

 Terezinha, a dancer in the carnival parade, is poor and lives in a shack in a shantytown. But she dreams of getting rich and becoming a socialite. When her aunt gets ill, she takes her place as a cook in the house of rich family, thinking she's already becoming part of the world of wealthy people.
