Todos los hombres sois iguales

 Three divorced men (a designer, a comercial airline pilot and a sport radio commentator) share a flat. They live together without trouble till they hire a cleaning lady with whom the three flirt. An architect, a sports journalist and an airline pilot have had their divorces backfire on them. Their ex-wives, tired of being lied to, have taken revenge by setting their children against them, taking all their belongings and forcing them into paying alimony with the hope of ruining them physically, economically and spiritually. They meet by chance, and their common hatred of the opposite sex gives them the perfect excuse to live together in a luxurious apartment, where they can smoke without trouble, dirty up without fear of being told off, constantly watch sports on television, have their one-night stands... but with the agreement that they will watch out for each other in case any of them makes the mistake of falling in love with a woman again. They all break the rule after they find out how beautiful their new cleaning lady, yet another divorcee, is.
