Skirt Shy

 Dobbs and Nancy, butler and maid to dowager Maggie Herring, learn from their employer that she is broke. If Edgar, her aged suitor, doesn't propose immediately, she'll lose the house and the pair will lose their jobs. While Maggie's off at the bank seeking mercy, Edgar arrives with flowers. To detain him, Nancy convinces Dobbs to don Maggie's clothes. "Pretend to be angry," Nancy advises. The plan seems to be working, with Edgar penitent and Dobbs unforgiving, when a gun-slinging Westerner, who used to court Maggie, arrives to seek her hand again. Bricks, bullets, and bloomers fly.
