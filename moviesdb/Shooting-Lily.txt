Shooting Lily

 David and Lily Hitchcock have been married for 6 years. During their marriage, David, a "professional videographer," has taped every vacation, party, significant event (buying a house), and trivial pursuit (rollerblading), with a single mindedness that is decidedly unsettling. The film opens at the Hitchcock's New Year's Eve party, during which Lily leaves David following his insistent demands that she perform step aerobics for the guests (and the camera). When David insists on a reason for the break-up, Lily replies, "Watch the videotapes." The film follows David's viewing of his library of Lily Videos, while he and his friends look for the reason for David's new life of pain and bewilderment.
