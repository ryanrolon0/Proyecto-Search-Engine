 Seventeen-year-old Farley has led a sheltered life, raised on a diet of home schooling, organic living and trips to the art gallery. To his parents' dismay, Farley loves to play shinny with the local rink rats. To their even greater dismay, Farley is scouted and signed by the owner (Stephen McHattie) of a junior league team, where he becomes an instant star. But Farley discovers that stardom comes with a price-including the expectation to fight on the ice. Throw in a changing relationship with his best friend (Allie MacDonald), and Farley finds himself losing his way.
