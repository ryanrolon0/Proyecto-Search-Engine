The Soup Song

 In a cafE, a band plays while Flip acts as conductor. Flip joins the group in singing a song, then a group of female cats come out and do a dance. Flip heads back to the kitchen to make soup for an important dinner guest. The boss gets angry when Flip stops to dance with one of the cats on his way to deliver the soup. When Flip finally delivers the soup, the guest of honor is satisfied and slurps his soup tunefully.
