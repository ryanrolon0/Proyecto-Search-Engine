Silent Assassins

 The evil criminal leader Kendrick has kidnapped an elderly biochemist who holds the secret to creating a biological superweapon. The only person who can possibly stop Kendrick and his gang is L. A. cop Sam Kettle and martial arts master Jun Kim (uncle of a little girl also kidnapped by Kendrick). Together, they go to war against an army of ninjas to rescue the hostages and bring their kidnappers to justice.
