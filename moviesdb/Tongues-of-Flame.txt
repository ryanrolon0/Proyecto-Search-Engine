Tongues of Flame

 A jealous dance-hall girl kills her lover. She escapes from the sheriff who is taking her to jail and hides out in the forest with a recluse who lives in a hollowed-out redwood. As the sheriff searches for her, a forest fire breaks out, and they must all band together if they hope to survive.
