That's Funny, Isn't It?

 Will is a struggling stand-up comic who shares a low-rent apartment with his waitress girlfriend, Grace, and a self-employed real estate agent, Chuck. Grace is burnt out, can't pay her share of the rent, and thinks she might be pregnant. She returns home after a tedious shift at the cafE. When Will comes home later that day, Grace tells him Chuck's been pestering her for the rent. Will suggests that they bring Chuck along to the beach. Grace tells Will she thinks she's pregnant. Will asks her to marry him. At the beach the next day, the three talk, but futilely. Also, we see Will is more than simply struggling. On the car ride home, all three have succumbed to silent resignation. Life inexorably plods along.
