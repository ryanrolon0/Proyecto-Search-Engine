The Satanic Rites of Dracula

 In London in the 1970s, Scotland Yard police investigators think they have uncovered a case of vampirism. They call in an expert vampire researcher named Van Helsing (a descendant of the great vampire-hunter himself, no less) to help them put a stop to these hideous crimes. It becomes apparent that the culprit is Count Dracula himself, disguised as a reclusive property developer, but secretly plotting to unleash a fatal virus upon the world. On the outskirts of London a Satanic Rite is being performed using Mia Martin to summon back Dracula. They have been infiltrated by a member of MI6 who escapes to warn the government of a plot. Special Branch contacts Van Helsing who recognizes his friend (Freddy Jones) as one of the conspirators. Confronting him, he discovers Dracula's plan to unleash bubonic plague upon the world. But Dracula has a trap for a more personal revenge against Van Helsing waiting. The last true Hammer Horror influenced various occult groups parapsychologist Stephen Armourae, much like the more famous The Wicker Man. It's 1974 - two years after the events in Dracula 1972. Strange things are happening - some girls are disappearing from the street and some of them are secretaries to important people. The Police and the Secret Service become interested when rich people (including a Lord) are pouring their empires into a foundation in which the boss hasn't been seen and a photograph of him doesn't produce a figure. The Inspector from D72 comes to see Van Helsing and Jessica and their investigations lead them to believe that the boss is Dracula...
