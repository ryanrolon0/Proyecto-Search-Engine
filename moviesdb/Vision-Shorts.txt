Vision Shorts

 A programme produced for the Community Channel by The Independent Film Trust (IFT), the UK charity which exists to advance the cause of independent film-making. The programme, first broadcast in November 2010, examines the Vision Shorts project to provide basic film training to people recovering from mental-health problems. The project was run by the IFT between January 2010 and April 2010 in partnership with the Raindance film organisation and Portugal Prints, part of the mental-health charity Westminster Mind. It was also supported by Westminster Arts.
