Skunk Ape!?

 In the wilds of Florida, folks will tell you about a monster that prowls around at night. A humanoid creature much larger than a man, covered with hair from head to toe. The ungodly stench of the creature is why it's called the Skunk Ape. This is the southern most bigfoot in the U.S., and folks have been spotting it for years. The movie Skunk Ape!? dares to ask the important, bold question music way too loudly in the Everglades and totally ticked off an ape-man? The answer may surprise you. Skunk Ape!? is the heart warming tale of an ape-man's bloody path of vengence through the streets of Chicago. It's chock full of thrills, gore, and rockin' music. Also if you're not careful you might just learn a thing or two before it's over.
