Rambo

 John Rambo is removed from prison by his former superior, Colonel Samuel Troutman, for a top-secret operation to bring back POW's still held in Vietnam. Rambo's assignment is to only take pictures of where the POWs are being held, but Rambo wants to get the POWs out of Vietnam. Teamed up with female Vietnamese freedom fighter Co Bao, Rambo embarks on a mission to rescue the POWs, who are being held by sadistic Vietnamese Captain Vinh and his Russian comrade, Lieutenant Colonel Padovsky. Rambo starts killing every enemy in sight while still focusing on his intentions to rescue the POWs. There are also corrupt American officials involved in the mission, including Marshall Murdock, one of Rambo's superiors. Former Green Beret John Rambo is serving time in a federal prison. When the US military hears of American soldiers missing in action from the Vietnam war possibly still being alive and held captive, Colonel Trautman is authorized to send Rambo in to rescue them. For Rambo, this is what he would do best. If only the pencil-pushers would stop getting in his way. John Rambo who is now in prison after the ruckus he caused in the previous movie, is approached by his former superior, Colonel Trautman. It seems that the government's looking for American MIA's in Vietnam, that are still being held there. Now the man in charge of the mission, Murdock, tells Rambo that his job is to go in, confirm their presence by taking photographs. Rambo senses that Murdock is not what he seems. Rambo goes in takes the photographs, but also takes one of the prisoners with him. When Murdock learns of this, he orders the chopper that's suppose to pick him up to pull out. Rambo is then captured. Obviously Murdock's desire was not to find anyone. Trautman warns him that Rambo's going to come after him. And that's what Rambo's going to do but first he is going after the Vietnamese and Russians, who brutalized him.
