Vicious

 Vicious is a twisted tale of fame, betrayal, breakdown, and murder. Sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll are only the beginning for rocker Bowie Thrash and his band The Code Blues. Vicious takes a deep, demented bite out of addiction and gives us a gritty, gruesome look at rock bottom as a star crashes and burns. Bowie Thrash takes us on a hellish journey through the nightmare that has become his reality.
