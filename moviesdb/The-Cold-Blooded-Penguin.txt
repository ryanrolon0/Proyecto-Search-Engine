The Cold-Blooded Penguin

 The narrator tells Donald the story of Pablo the penguin, who dreamed of moving to a warmer climate. After several false attempts, he makes a boat out of a chunk of ice. All goes well, until he crosses the equator and his boat starts to melt, but he's able to make do with the bathtub he brought along. Eventually, he lands on a tropical island, where sometimes he dreams of moving to a cooler climate.
