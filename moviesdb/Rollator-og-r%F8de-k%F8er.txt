Rollator og røde køer

 74 year-old Hans Andersen has lived his whole life on the same farm. He lives all alone at the empty farm, which once was full of life. Nevertheless, Hans is still quite active. His 70 year-old neighbour Ole and other widow farmers meet to mow the lawn with their lawn tractors or have a nice coffee table with rhubarb cake.
