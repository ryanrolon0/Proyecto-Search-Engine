Way of Life

 Way of Life follows the story of Michael Daube, a young man of modest means from small town America who finds a valuable piece of art in the garbage, sells it at auction and builds a hospital in one of the most remote areas of India. The film follows an organic path around the world, focusing on the aspects of Daube's work that inspire us to consider and appreciate our own best intentions. With camera work that is both intimate and stunning, director/cinematographer, David Driver interweaves moments of this incredible journey to illustrate how Daube's simple, ground level approach to working with marginalized communities in the developing world transforms the lives of those involved.
