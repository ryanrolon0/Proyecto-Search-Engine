Raul the Terrible

 Raul Castells was born in the city of Che Guevara. He admires Che's convictions. Raul is a walking, talking force of nature. He fights the Government. He fights big business. He invades buildings and occupies casinos. And he has good reason. The average Argentinian does not have a job, a roof over their head or any means to provide for their family. There are currently 20 million people below the poverty line. With intimate and often dangerously close access, Raul, the Terrible is a warts-and-all portrait of a man driven to change the world and a frightening insight into the politics of poverty.
