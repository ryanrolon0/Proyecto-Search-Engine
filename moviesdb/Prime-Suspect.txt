Prime Suspect

 Jane Tennison's promotion to Superintendent turns out to put her in charge of an investigation and search for an abducted baby. She gets more involved in it than she intended considering that she just had an abortion. However, she turns out to be the one of most cool headed of her team when the prime suspect seems to be a man who was a child molester recently released from a clinic. As people start to investigate him, emotions get in the way and terrible mistakes are made that seem beyond Supt. Tennison's ability to correct. Newly promoted Detective Chief Superintendent Jane Tennison leads the investigation into the abduction of a 14 month old baby girl, Vicky Warwick, from her crib. The child's mother, Susan Covington, was knocked unconscious, leaving a nasty gash on her forehead and causing memory loss. Her husband, John Warwick, had left them less than a year ago but appears to have an alibi. Susan had given her nanny, whom she shared with a co-worker, a cellphone, a camera and mace leading Tennison to suspect that Susan was worried about something. She recalls someone she saw in the park, a man with two little girls. When the police learn that a convicted pedophile, Chris Hughes lives just a short distance from where the child was abducted, he becomes their prime suspect. They're convinced he's their man when Susan eventually picks him out of a line-up as the man she saw in the park. Only have they got it all wrong.
