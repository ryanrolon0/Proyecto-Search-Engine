The Marksmen

 The Marksmen is about a native Wausau boy named Tommy Madden, who makes it big in big league baseball, but is forced to leave in disgrace. He returns home after the sudden death of his mother, and faces his father's disappointment in him, even though others consider him a hero. With the comfort of his high school sweetheart, he faces his past and leads a new team, The Marksmen, made up of his hometown buddies, to the national softball fastpitch tournament.
