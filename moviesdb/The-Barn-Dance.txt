The Barn Dance

 Mickey comes in his horse and buggy to pick up Minnie for the barn dance, but he's aced out by his rival, Pete, with a car, until the car breaks down. At the dance hall, Mickey dances on Minnie's feet. She rejects him to dance with Pete, until Mickey puts a helium balloon in his pants, thus making him light on his feet. Pete figures it out, punctures the balloon, and takes over, making this a rare cartoon where Pete wins. Mickey and Putrid Pete vie to take Minnie Mouse to a barn dance. Mickey gets the upper hand when Pete's car falls apart and continues to hold his own by using a balloon to give his dancing feet some lift. Unfortunately Pete punctures the balloon and wins out over our sobbing
