Quattro bravi ragazzi

 Rene, a Neapolitan growing up in Milan, leads a gang of three who hang out after school, smoke pot, disco, and engage in muggings and petty theft. Their fence is the cynical and menacing Marcione. Rene invites a new kid, the rich and well-tailored Giorgio, to join the group over Marco's objections. Giorgio ratchets up the violence of their crimes, threatening sexual assault of a woman they rob and bashing the head of a pensioner. Rene's losing control woos away Rene's girlfriend; Giorgio and Rene win a bet with Marcione; they are arrested for assault and car theft; and, upon release, take a further step into violence and oblivion.
