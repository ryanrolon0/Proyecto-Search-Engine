Rustler's Round-up

 While using the same title as a 1933 Universal film starring Tom Mix, this one combines elements of two Johnny Mack Brown Universal westerns, "Law and Order-1940" and "The Silver Bullet-1942", with the story stress on "Law and Order." The "Vote For Cal Dixon" song is the same as "The Vote For Emily Morgan" song in "The Silver Bullet". while the Cal Dixon name comes from a character in "Law and Order." In this one, Bob Bryan (Kirby Grant) has a marshal's badge pinned to his chest, and with the aid of his pal, Pinkerton J. "Pinky" Pratt (Fuzzy Knight),proceeds to clean up the murder-and-rustling operations in a town ran by a trio of outlaw brothers (Frank Marlo, Edmund Cobb and Ethan Laidlaw), who are basically the same as the Northup brothers from the 1932 "Law and Order" and the Daggett brothers from the 1940 "Law and Order", only they are now known as the Todds.
