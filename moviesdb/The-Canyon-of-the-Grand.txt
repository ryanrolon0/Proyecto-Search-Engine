The Canyon of the Grand

 Taken on the line of the Denver & Rio Grande Railway. The Grand Canyon of Colorado is one of the notable features of the West. Near Glenwood Springs the lofty walls of the canyon soar abruptly to a height of 3,000 feet. Winding among the ragged crags, this picture is one of special interest.
