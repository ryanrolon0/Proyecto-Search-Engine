President McKinley's Speech at the Pan-American Exposition

 In this picture we present a wonderful and life-like likeness of President McKinley. He first walks upon the platform, escorting Mrs. McKinley, whom he very reverently shows to a seat. The President is next introduced to the audience by President Milburn, of the Pan-American Exposition, and, amid hand-clapping, cheering and waving of hats, he at once begins his memorable speech. He is close to our camera and we secured an absolutely perfect photograph.
