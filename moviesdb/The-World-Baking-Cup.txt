The World Baking Cup

 Every three years the best bakers from around the world meet in Paris, France for the ultimate baking battle - Le Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie. Twelve teams of devoted men and women will race the clock and each other, testing their skills, creativity, and endurance in this Olympics of baking. Working from secret recipes, the teams prepare scores of traditional baguette and wonderfully shaped specialty breads, containing everything from fruit to nuts. Each team must also create an elaborate showpiece, reflecting their country's national identity and made entirely of edible ingredients. Originality, technique, and attention to detail are the name of the game; the prestigious prize - the glittering World Baking Cup trophy. While the French team struggles with temperamental equipment, the Japanese competitors unveil their green brioche. Their showpiece is a marvel of realism garden, complete with tiny, white cherry blossoms.
