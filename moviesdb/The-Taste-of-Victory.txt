The Taste of Victory

 The legend begins on a desert highway with rumors of a yellow Mustang and a mysterious Woman racer. A Drifter comes out of nowhere, hungry to race the Woman whom no man has been able to defeat. When the two race on a treacherous strip of roadway nicknamed "Challenger Mile", it is a cat and mouse game of speed and skill that ends with only one racer tasting victory.
