Watch & Learn

 Martin, played by Leslie Jordan (Will & Grace, Boston Legal), can't seem to get respect from anyone. His co-worker Ted always turns to Martin when looking to pass the buck. His less than friendly neighbor is not fond of his taste in music or any noise for that matter. Probably most insulting of all, is the disrespectful treatment he receives from a very frigid shop owner when trying to return broken merchandise. Martin stumbles upon an ad promising to help him "get respect, get things done" and his life is about to change. Martin's new personal trainer, who is in a life change of his own, teaches him some very unorthodox methods of persuasion. Martin is a very quick learner. Perhaps he learns too well.
