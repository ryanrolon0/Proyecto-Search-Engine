The Lord's Prayer

 Words have power, you may get what you ask for. Have you ever had a moment when you wished to be answered? To be heard? To be faithful? When your world is turned on its side and your awakening becomes reality. Peace is attainable through your ability to release the past, see the present in a new light, to experience the glory of the Voice inside your heart. In the actions of one man's shallow words, he finds the answers he unknowingly seeks rustling through the leaves, dancing on the spider's web, in the grass beneath his feet. The Lord's Prayer is the journey of one man's experiences. A journey we examine for ourselves as we travel with our spiritual being guiding us to knowledge of the words we speak. The hollow words take on meaning, the meaning of The Lord's Prayer comes into reality. Our reality.
