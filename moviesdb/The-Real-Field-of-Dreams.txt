The Real Field of Dreams

 Pat O' Connor is not your typical baseball fan, and he doesn't have your typical backyard. What started as a pipe dream on a coffee-stained napkin in 1999 evolved into a crazy WIFFLEBALL extravaganza held annually every August. At the heart of it all is Travis Roy, who after being paralyzed playing hockey for Boston University was inspired to start a foundation for those who had to face the difficulties of life after spinal cord injuries. O'Connor read Travis' book, Eleven Seconds, and was inspired to use his creation to help Travis' foundation. The result is a on-of-a-kind event that has helped raise thousands of dollars for those who desperately need it.
