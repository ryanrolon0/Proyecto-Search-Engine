Voodoun Blues

 A black and white, 16mm film featuring a pernicious practitioner of black magic performing a malevolent voodoo ritual, in order to seek some morbid retribution from a reclusive ex-lover. The motive behind the exhibition is ambiguous but inevitable, as the vindictive priestess hexes her victim in dreams, in consciousness, and ultimately in death.
