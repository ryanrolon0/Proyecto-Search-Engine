The Deal

 A very sheltered, naive man, Jack, pays his so called friend Chris to help him find his soul mate. Chris works out a deal with a girl and tells her to befriend Jack, be his girlfriend and then dump him. Chris's plan is to do the same thing over again, a different girl each time, so Jack can keep giving him money. In the end the girl takes the money, but tells Jack about the deal. Jack confronts Chris, but Chris's smooth talking convinces naive Jack that finding a soul mate is not the way to go.
