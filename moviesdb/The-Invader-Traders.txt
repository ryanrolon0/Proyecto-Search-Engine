The Invader Traders

 The world is under attack by gasoline-drinking aliens. Or at least Quiet Guy (Carlos Gutierrez) thinks it is after he misunderstands a talk show on TV. He convinces his best friend, Geezer (Claudio Dibiase), that they must fight back, and together the two inept but determined vigilantes try to save the world. Attila Kovarcsik's second short film is a sly comedy shot with no budget. It won the 2009 Centre For Arts And Technology prize for best film by a student.
