The Sisters Do Rockefeller

 The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is an international order of gay nuns founded in San Francisco's Castro District in 1979. Their stated mission is the promulgation of universal joy, the expiation of stigmatic guilt, and service to the community. Sister Hysterectoria, one of the founding members, tells us about the history of the organization, and she and a fellow sister visit Rockefeller Center at Christmastime.
