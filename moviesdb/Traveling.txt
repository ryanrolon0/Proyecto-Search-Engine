Traveling

 Traveling is the story of three people who have never really had a family that find that connection on a road trip to Austin. Andrew is a man lost; hitchhiking from Phoenix to Austin, he meets Jen. On the road herself to drop her niece Kaylee off in Taylor, Texas, Jen offers Andrew a ride. What happens to the three of them on this trip changes each in ways they would never expect. Jen has just lost her brother to cancer; saddled with her niece Kaylee, and terrified of the prospect of becoming her sole guardian, she offers to drive Kaylee to Texas to meet the mother who abandoned her. Andrew is headed to a more uncertain future. Convicted of an accidental crime where he lost everything, Andrew is more specifically headed to prison for at least three years. When their paths cross, Andrew is looking for a ride, Jen needs a distraction, and Kaylee is looking for any kind of connection.
