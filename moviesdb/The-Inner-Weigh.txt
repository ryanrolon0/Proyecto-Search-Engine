The Inner Weigh

 Diets don't work. In fact, 95% of the people who go on a diet end up regaining the lost pounds and often more. That is why, despite the diet industry having grown to an almost $70 billion per year industry, the world keeps getting fatter. The reason diets don't work for long-term weight loss is that they treat the problem as if it is only a matter of willpower and physics lose weight. That is the old paradigm address the inner issues that lead to weight gain and then imposes behavior change from the outside. The Inner Weigh presents a new paradigm for weight loss. Through interviews with over 20 different teachers and authors, this film introduces viewers to the idea that permanent weight loss begins within. Viewers are presented with the idea that the physical body is controlled by the subconscious mind and the image of ourselves that we hold within the subconscious. The film posits that the key to permanent physical change is to permanently change that self-image.
