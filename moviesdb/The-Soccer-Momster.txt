The Soccer Momster

 A hilarious spin on what happens when parents take their kid's sports too seriously. When the coach of a kids soccer team is hurt, the only person who can take his place is a quiet, gentle soccer Mom. But things quickly get out of control as she turns into General Patton in an effort to get the team to win. A brilliant plot twist takes this side splitting family comedy to an entirely new level.
