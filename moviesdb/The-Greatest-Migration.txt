The Greatest Migration

 They say you can hear them coming. Snake River salmon swim more than 900 miles inland and climb almost 7,000 feet to reach their spawning grounds--the highest salmon spawning habitat on the planet, and the largest and wildest habitat left in the continental United States. These iconic fish travel farther and higher than any other salmon on Earth, but a gauntlet of federal dams blocks their great migration and is pushing these high-altitude salmon to extinction. Follow their epic journey from the waters of southeast Alaska to the cold, wild rivers of Idaho's Sawtooth Valley--along the way learning of the lives they touch and the obstacles they must overcome to survive.
