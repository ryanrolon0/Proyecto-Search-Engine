Syrup

 The bald Killer sits in a run-down pub waiting for suitable victims. A suitable victim enters, and the Killer laces him with drink. At last orders they both return to the Killer's flat, and the Killer brutally murders his victim. It appears that the Killer has a fetish for hair, and he produces a razor to scalp the long-haired victim. However, it turns out the victim is also bald and is wearing a wig, or as it is known in Cockney Rhyming Slang, a Syrup.
