Summerspiel

 SUMMERSPIEL takes you right onto the ice for a rare glimpse into the sport of curling in its most unique setting - a Mardi Gras-themed bonspiel (curling tournament) on a hockey rink, in the middle of the June. At the heart of this exploration in curling lore is a team of twenty-something urban Canadians, who have recently discovered and fallen in love with the sport. The film follows the team as they set out to compete in their first bonspiel and come face to face with some of the game's greatest proponents.
