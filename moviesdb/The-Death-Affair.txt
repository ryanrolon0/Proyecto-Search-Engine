The Death Affair

 Death and Santa Claus are friends from way back, as anyone might imagine. They meet at the local bar one day where Santa asks Death to do him a small favor and please bump off Mrs. Claus, of whom he's grown quite tired. Death is reluctant to do so however, because he's having an affair with her.
