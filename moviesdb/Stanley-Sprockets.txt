Stanley Sprockets

 The Sprocket's (Scott, Isabelle & Theo) are a family that has been driving around the world for the past ten years in a green double decker bus, financing the entire trip with their street circus show. The documentary develops in their way trough Mexico and gives us an insight of their way of living; a world full of circus, adventure and music. As we go along with them, we can see moments of absolute freedom as well as the difficulties of living on the road. 'Stanley Sprocekt's 101 ways to make a world tour' is the story of a dreamer who shows us that we can't buy the world, we can only travel trough it.
