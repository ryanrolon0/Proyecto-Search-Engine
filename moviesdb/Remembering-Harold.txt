Remembering Harold

 Harold Kandel was a theatre fan, social activist and a champion and unrelenting heckler. Beloved and feared by many a Toronto actor in the eighties and nineties - they remember him here with fondness, frustration, awe and hilarity. A remarkable character who imprinted himself all on he encountered.
