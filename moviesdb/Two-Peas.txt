Two Peas

 A man and a woman, living two lonely separate lives, struggle to get to know each other over the phone - for both of them, the burden of the past is a silent intruder. Over the course of a day, as we observe them and listen to a re-cap of their conversations, it becomes obvious that they have more in common than either realizes. As they prepare to meet for the first time, and the true nature of their relationship emerges, their similarity may be what eventually keeps them apart.
