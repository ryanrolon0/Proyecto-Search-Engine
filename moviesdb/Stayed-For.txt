Stayed For

 Stayed For is a story about a New Jersey high school student, Jeff Denison, who experiences a drastic personality transformation after a family tragedy leaves him shocked into apathy and recklessness. Despite his situation, and unusual changes in his behavior and general hygiene, Jeff continues to attend high school, the only place that makes him feel like he's still alive--like he has the mental and emotional capacity to keep moving forward. Aside from the emotional aftermath of the tragedy, his fractured relationship with his recluse of a mother makes home an impossible place to live. As his behavior becomes more and more extreme, contrasting with the fixed rules of academia, Jeff's ability, and even his desire, to re-adapt to his environment seem to be slipping.
