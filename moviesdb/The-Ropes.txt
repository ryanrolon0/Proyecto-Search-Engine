The Ropes

 Ever been so frustrated with your job that you just wanted to explode and leave it all behind? Meet Marlon, your average, neurotic, number-crunching kind of guy. All he wants is some peace and quiet so he can gt his work done. Meet Lanel, your beyond average, flamboyant, and excessively annoying co-worker. All she wants is to get to know Marlon a bit better. But, a man who is so passionate about his work can have trouble relating to other people. Especially when that other person is Lanel. THE ROPES is a tale of two mis-matched individuals who are forced to deal with each other on a daily basis. You never know who is going to come along in life and turn things upside down.
