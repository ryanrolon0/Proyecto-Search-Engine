Visiting St. Louis

 This Traveltalk visit to St. Louis, Missouri, starts with a short history lesson. We then see several of the city's architectural landmarks and the many types of vessels that travel on the Mississippi River. About four minutes (of nine) are spent at the zoological garden in Forest Park, where we see rhinoceros, giraffes, polar bears, giant pandas, and a group of trained elephants.
