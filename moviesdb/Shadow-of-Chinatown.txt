Shadow of Chinatown

 Released both as a 15-chapter serial and as a condensed feature version (for theaters that didn't use serials) which means that all of the cast and crew would one day be credited in some sources with a misleading extra film appearance added to their filmographies even though they only worked on (and got paid) for one performance or job. The story (serial and/or feature) deals with the plotting of a European importing firm to put Chinese trade competition in a west coast Chinatown - city unnamed, but it's by the bay and it isn't Oakland - out of business. Their representative, Sonya Rokoff/The Dragon Lady, a beautiful Eurasian girl, hires Victor Poten, a mad Eurasian chemist and inventor and an equal-opportunity racist who hates both Chinese and White races, to aid her. Poten, by means of his infernal inventions and underworld henchmen, conducts successful raids on the Chinese merchants and also successfully eludes the people hunting and investigating him. Those include newspaper reporter Joan Whiting, her sweetheart Martin Andrews, Willy Fu, Martin's servant, and police Captain Walters and his detectives. After narrow escapes from death in the form of bombs, poison-traps, infernal machines and some hand-to-hand, five-on-one scuffling in Chinatown's underworld, Martin finally captures Poten just as he is about to indulge in a little wholesale killing by poisoning the wine served at a Chinese merchant's banquet.
