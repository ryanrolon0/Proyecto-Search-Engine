Shantytown

 Elizabeth "Liz" Gorty ('Mary Lee (I)' (qv)) lives with her mother and stepfather in a ramshackle boarding house in "Shantytown" on the "wrong side of the tracks." Bill Allen ('John Archer (I)' (qv)) and his wife Virginia ('Marjorie Lord' (qv)) rent a room from the Gorty's and "Liz", always a tomboy, resolves to become a lady like Virginia, who is expecting a baby. Bill is a fugitive from the law because he was innocently involved in a crime pulled off by the "Ace" Landers gang. Landers ('Noel Madison' (qv)) locates Bill and the latter is forced to drive a get-away car in a bank robbery. The gang is caught but Bill escapes. Meanwhile, Virginia is ill and is attended by kindly old "Doc" Herndon ('Harry Davenport (I)' (qv)). "Liz" manages to get on an amateur-hour broadcast, sings "On The Corner of Sunshine and Main" and "It Had To Be You", accompanied by Marty Malneck ('Matty Malneck' (qv)) and his Orchestra , and she tosses in a plea for Bill to come home.
