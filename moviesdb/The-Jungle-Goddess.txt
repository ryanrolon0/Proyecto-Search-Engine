The Jungle Goddess

 A young girl is kidnapped and thrown in the empty basket of a hot-air balloon. The balloon is accidentally cut loose and drifts to the middle of darkest Africa. The young girl is captured by cannibals, but instead of being eaten, she is turned into a goddess by the tribe. Years afterward, a young man who had been a childhood friend of hers mounts an expedition into the jungle to find and rescue her.
