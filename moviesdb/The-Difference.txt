The Difference

 Prentice Wells is trapped, trapped in a world of clothes, money and affluence. In his quest for material bliss he charges eight thousand dollars to his father's credit card. His father responds by forcing his repayment of the debt, and his participation in a 'materialism recovery" program, The Difference Program. The Difference Program pairs teens from America, with Teens from Africa. Through the program the kids learn about the differences in their cultures, their aspirations, money, and what matters in life.
