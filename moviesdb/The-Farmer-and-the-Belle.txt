The Farmer and the Belle

 Olive Oyl's Farm is desparately in need of a farmhand. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the boys are driving by. They compete for the job. Chores Getting water from a well, picking apples, shoeing a horse, gathering eggs. Popeye feeds a hen a little spinach, and she produces a mountain of eggs, which eventually end up all over Bluto. Bluto drops an anvil on Popeye, then goes after Olive against her wishes, chasing her into a succession of haystacks (where he finds a needle!). The chicken feeds Popeye his spinach, and he triumphs, sending Bluto into the pigpen (where the pigs won't have anything to do with him).
