This Is How We Dream

 What do a fit model, janitor, construction company owner, lawyer, student, photographer, and web-designer have in common? They all have a never ending passion for writing songs and performing their music. So every Friday night, they throw their name in the hat at the UnUrban Coffeehouse for a chance to play. They get ten minutes to sing two songs and live their dreams. This is how they dream.
