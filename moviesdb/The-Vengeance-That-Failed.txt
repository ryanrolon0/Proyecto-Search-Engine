The Vengeance That Failed

 The ranger's sweetheart has ridden her horse to a hill top in order to intercept her lover on his return from a round of inspection. Riding across the plain with a number of cowboys, he sees the girl, and spurs his horse in her direction. The lover's meeting is witnessed by an outlaw, who as just completed a term of imprisonment, which he owes to the ranger. Eager for revenge, he plots with his fellow outlaws to kidnap the girl. The ranger's sweetheart is carried to the outlaw's camp. The ranger follows the tracks until it leads him to the outlaw's camp. He enlists the aid of a number of cowboys, who make an attack on the camp, while the ranger enters the camp through a secret tunnel, fells the leader, and escapes with the girl. The outlaws are caught between two fires-the ranger firing through the tunnel and the cowboys in front, and they throw up their hands. Vengence has failed.
