Shuffle & Cut

 SHUFFLE & CUT looks at an independent American filmmaker's struggle to make his voice heard in a culture crippled by a blockbuster mentality, the belief that bigger is better and the and the 3-Deification of CGI. In this freewheeling memoir, filmmaker Richard Evans pays tribute to innovators Godard, Cocteau, Vigo, Cassavetes, Robert Downey Sr., Bruce Conner, Adolfas Mekas and Edgar G. Ulmer.
