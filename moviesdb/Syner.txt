 Something is not as it should be. This feeling is shared by three people, otherwise unconnected. A young woman gets trapped inside her own apartment as strangers start gathering outside her door. In a desolate house, a depressed man is forced to act upon a letter he receives from his dead wife. And in the heart of the city, a guest at a cafe sees a strange face in the crowd and cannot let go of its expression. In this film, we get to meet people trapped inside their private nightmares, fighting unknown threats.
