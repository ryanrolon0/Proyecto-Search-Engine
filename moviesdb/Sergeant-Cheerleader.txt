Sergeant Cheerleader

 Cadet Will Poole is training for the Ranger Challenge when some cheerleaders, impressed by his athleticism, convince him to join the cheerleading squad. Will reluctantly joins, partly to pursue Mary, the Captain of the cheerleading squad. However, his fellow cadets are embarrassed to be lead by a male cheerleader and pressure him to quit cheerleading.
