The Red Sneakers

 A kid named Reggie Reynolds is a high school student who is good in the classroom but not so good on the basketball court. But one day he meets a junk dealer who gives him a pair of old gym shoes that once were worn by an all-star in the Negro Basketball leagues in the 1930's. Reggie puts the red sneakers on and he is immediately playing like a superstar on the basketball court. He gets the attention of a major shoe company executive who wants Reggie to switch from the old red sneakers that he is wearing to his company's brand. But Reggie knows if he's not wearing those magical old red sneakers he is back on the sideline.
