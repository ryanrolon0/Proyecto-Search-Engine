Serpent Rising

 To hide from his past sins as a government assassin, former agent Paul Thorn withdrew to an anonymous identity and a quiet life of normalcy. When a former partner delivers blueprints for a lethal technological secret and dies on Paul's floor, Paul is forced back into the deadly world of international espionage where nothing is as it seems, betrayal is the standard, and lives are expendable. The blueprints are sought by a long list of people on both sides of the law requiring Paul to use every trick in his arsenal, long-forgotten agency contacts, and the aid of an unwilling recruit - jaded nurse Stacia. Together, they confront the agency assassins, Paul's inner demons, and a deadly former military rival in this fast pace action thriller.
