The Preacher

 While a street preacher is busy with preaching meets an older man (Prophet) who keep slapping him in the face and telling him to quit preaching and to go home, that he is not meant for it, till the preacher breaks in tears and understands the old man's point, then the old man tells him what he should do in future.
