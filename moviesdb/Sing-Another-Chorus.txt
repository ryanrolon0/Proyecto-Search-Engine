Sing Another Chorus

 Arthur Peyton, sole owner of Peyton Frocks,Inc., is wrestling with a multitude of problems; slow sales, slower collections and a son, Andy, who wants to write stage revues. Andy is being urged on by Francine La Verne, an ex-burlesque performer. Edna, private secretary to the elder Peyton, and Stanislaus, the company janitor, are also preparing an amateur show to celebrate the company's 25th anniversary. Theodore Gateson has agreed to produce a musical Andy wrote in college, but takes Peyton's $50,000 advance and vanishes. Meanwhile, Edna has Andy working on a revue that will serve to introduce new designs to buyers in New York. Before the finale of the revue, Francine and Stanislaus arrive backstage, dragging a bruised Gateson, who they have caught before he could spend the advance money.
