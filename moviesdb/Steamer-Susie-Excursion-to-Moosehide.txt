Steamer Susie Excursion to Moosehide

 There are women and children a-plenty in Dawson, and where you find women and children, you find excursions, balls, parties, picnics, and things to amuse. This picture shows the steamer "Susie" with a gay crowd of excursionists, backing away from the Dawson Wharf and then passing under a full head of steam, bound for the Siwash Indian village of Moosehide.
