Raton Pass

 The ambitious Ann arrives with the stagecoach in Raton Pass to find herself in the midst of a feud between the Challon and the Pozner families. Ann immediately seeks out Marc Challon, a young man from the richest cattle ranch family, who is in love with Lena Casamajor. Seductively Ann works her way into Marc's heart. Marc marries her and Ann is given deed to half the ranch by Marc's father Pierre. When her husband brings home an even richer man (Prentice), who owns a railroad in hopes of getting him to financially back the ranch, Ann convinces Marc to leave the job to her. Instead, Ann seduces Prentice into falling in love with her also and talks him into buying out her husband. He agrees. Suddenly, Ann and Prentice find themselves totally alone as Marc and all the hands have quit the ranch. So Ann sends for the gunslinger Cy Van Cleave, she met in the past. Cy brings in his fellow outlaws and they begin to take over the cattle ranch.
