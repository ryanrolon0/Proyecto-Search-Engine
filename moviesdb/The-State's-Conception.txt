The State's Conception

 Late in the 21st-century, a new world government has taken complete control of childbirth, imposing vasectomies on all baby boys and giving lab-grown infants to those couples who pass tests for cooperative behavior. Jon and Sally have applied to adopt a son, but there's a glitch in their application. In desperation, they turn to self-determination, and, with the help of a rich old man, to natural pregnancy. But the government, called Columbus, may have other ideas in store for Sally and Jon.
