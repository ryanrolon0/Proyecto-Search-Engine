Time Flies

 Do you remember the moment when time stopped dragging along and suddenly started to fly? In this short film that combines documentary with stop-motion animation, the worlds of four very Real older folks meet that of a triangle shaped girl and her pet pig as they confront a windless day. Together they muse over the riddles of time, weather, dreams, and inexplicable falling objects.
