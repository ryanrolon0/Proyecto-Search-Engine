Volere volare

 Martina is a professional lady whose clients are harmless if eccentric; she sees herself as a social worker. Shy Maurizio dubs sound for cartoons while his outgoing brother dubs more saucy material and gets the girls. After Maurizio accidentally helps Martina on some of her assignations she decides to find out if he wants to help regularly. Whether or not it's the possibility of romance, Maurizio is horrified to find on their first date that his hands have been replaced by cartoon ones with minds of their own. Two brothers run a company that dubs films. One hires semi-naked actresses to provide sound effects for porn films; the other, the shy Maurizio (Nichetti), puts sound effects on cartoons. Meanwhile, Martina (Angela Finocchiare) is a "social worker" - that is, a call-girl who helps men (or couples) fulfill their fantasies...
