Shamrock and Swastika

 This documentary is about the ill-fated collaboration between the Irish Republican Army and the German Secret Service during World War II. SS Colonel Dr. Edmund Veesenmayer (German Foreign Office) devised a plan to bring Ireland into war with England over control Ireland. Under the plan the IRA would organize resistance movements to the British occupation and rule over Northern Ireland while the Germans attacked Great Britain. This documentary also notes the involvement, in varying degrees, of many prominent Irish scholars and diplomats.
