Rain for Morgan

 Set in drought-stricken, post WWII country Australia, Rain for Morgan captures both the beauty and the eerie other-worldliness of love in a dying landscape. Forced from her home and trapped in the desolation of the outback, Morgan longs to return to the safety of her previous life. But unless she can free herself from Johnny's dark hold, his world will become forever hers. Based upon the mythological themes of the Celtic legend Johnny Croy and the Mermaid, Rain for Morgan was shot on location in Yabba North, Victoria, Australia, and combines stunning visuals with with time lapse footage and underwater photography.
