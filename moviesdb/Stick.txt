Stick

 Ernest (Stick) Stickley returns from prison, and very soon he gets involved with his old friend in a drug-running deal that goes sour. Hired by a rich investor, he tries to walk the line, but trouble follows him throughout as he tries to collect a debt and make up for lost time with his daughter. Stick also finds a new flame with a lady financial wizard (Kyle) and gets set to enjoy a new life, but Chucky and Nestor, the two hoods that owe him the debt, have other plans for Stick.
