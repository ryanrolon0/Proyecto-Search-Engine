So

 "I am not a lucky person." A solemn voice states under a black screen. This is the beginning of So, an experimental travel documentary inspired by acclaimed French filmmaker Chris Marker's Sans Soleil. This unconventional road movie celebrates being single with one young woman's long awaited trip through Australia, alone. Still photography, moving images and voice over narration comprise an intimate self portrait that becomes a personal journey to overcome fear, search for contentedness and accept life's experience as the accumulation of fragments of memory.
