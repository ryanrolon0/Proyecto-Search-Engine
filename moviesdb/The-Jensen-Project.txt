The Jensen Project

 Claire and Matt Thompson are married scientists who are visited by a wealthy woman who funds a secret organization called The Jensen Project that they previously worked for and left when Claire was humiliated by a failed experiment. The group conducts advanced underground research to solve the world's most difficult problems and Ingrid asks them to return in order to help keep a potentially dangerous technology from falling into the wrong hands. They are accompanied by their tech minded and somewhat rebellious son Brody.
