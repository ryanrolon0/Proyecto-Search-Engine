Riders to the Stars

 In an attempt to discover the composition of meteors, three astronauts are sent out into space in three specially designed rockets. Their mission is to capture a meteor and bring it to Earth. In the mid-1950's, American scientists determine that they require metal from meteors if they are to build spacecraft that can withstand the rigors of space travel. To that end they recruit 12 scientists and ask them to undergo a series of tests. The men don't quite know exactly what they are being tested for but in the end, three are selected to go into space. The mission is a success, but not all will return.
