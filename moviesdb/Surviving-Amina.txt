Surviving Amina

 Surviving Amina is a challenging love story about hope in the face of death. It is an intimate diary on resilience that explores how we construct meaning from events that defy our emotional understanding child. New York and Italy set the backdrop for this engrossing portrait of a family of artists through a three year period marked by the Leukemia diagnosis of their second child, baby Amina, and the aftermath of her death. The movie doesn't follow medical details; it focuses on the emotional journey of the couple as they try to cope with happiness, sorrow, love, contempt, illness and fear. Without ever judging and with immense sensibility it raises disturbing questions about how we confront the most extreme of circumstances.
