The Theater of Martin Lim

 This film, which takes place in San Francisco, is about Martin Lim, a whimsical seventy year old Asian-American man who performs outside his flat, dancing and singing tunes from 1940-50's Hollywood musicals, Lydia, his beautiful and flamboyant ex-dance partner, and Anne, a 20-something year old pre-med. student and aspiring dancer, who meet unexpectedly. In an unforgettable evening, Martin and Lydia recount their life's journey as Asian-American entertainers to Anne. Unable to speak due to a stroke, Lim creates an alternate mode of expression to communicate his past. A physical style of conversation made up of elements of gesture, dance and theater. Through this "silent performance", not only does Lydia rediscover her artistic voice, but Anne is inspired to pursue her dreams of becoming a dancer.
