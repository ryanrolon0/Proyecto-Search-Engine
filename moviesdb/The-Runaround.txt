The Runaround

 The Runaround is an action comedy centered around two childhood friends who are facing eviction from the apartment they share unless they can come up with $1,500 in four days. A chance encounter with an old acquaintance leads to the opportunity for a big score, but they'll have to wade into the unfamiliar territory of their city's murky criminal underworld.
