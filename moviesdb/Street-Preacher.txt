Street Preacher

 Street Preacher provides a glimpse into the ministry of Ward Draper, an unorthodox Pastor who serves those in need on the streets in British Columbia's Bible-belt. Faced with his own troubled past, Ward is challenged to go where others fear to tread, in order to fulfill a calling from God. With a dozen or so volunteers, he builds community and relationships with the poor and homeless, as he brings the church to those in need. An examination of faith in action, Street Preacher explores what it takes to serve those on the edge of society.
