The Lost Item

 When Jill wakes up on a Sunday morning following a one night stand, she quickly realizes that she has a problem, and does what any single woman would do in such a situation -- she calls her best gay friend for help. The Lost Item is the story of one single woman's attempt to handle a delicate situation while maintaining her dignity -- not an easy task when searching for this particular lost item.
