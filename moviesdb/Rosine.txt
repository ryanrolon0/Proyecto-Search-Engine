Rosine

 Rosine and her mother Marie have been living together as friends for 14 years. 14 Rosine is when Pierre, her father, returns. Pierre now wants to make up for lost time, to catch up with Marie, and to capture Rosine (with his incestuous intention). But Rosine and Marie are like one person, you cannot separate them despite all your best efforts!
