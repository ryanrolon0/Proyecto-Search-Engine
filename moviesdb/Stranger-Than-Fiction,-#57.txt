Stranger Than Fiction, #57

 This one presents a millionaire who has a hobby of making doll furniture for poor children, a cow which gives birth to four calves; a sculptor who works with metal instead of clay; a church for the deaf; an English truck driver who is the father of 13 children; a Canadian who paints miniature pictures with a single-hair brush, the smallest post office in the world; and an acrobatic youngster with remarkable contortion skills. And does it all in nine minutes.
