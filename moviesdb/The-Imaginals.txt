The Imaginals

 Imaginals are creatures that inhabit our psyche with their own stories, emotions, passions and dangers. Often we make them up so we don't feel so alone. In the film, a young girl enters a shadowy world to find herself surrounded by entities that tell her stories. As these stories unfold, darker shadows appear, and the girl learns that she is surrounded by more than just the inventions of her imagination.
