Terpsichore

 Long Synopsis A holistic female practitioner of music and dance is brought to a southwest USA clinic, to assist with the clinic's growing load of patients. The administrator of the clinic is already familiar with this practitioner's methods and success rate. She has been brought in to function just as an advanced troubleshooter might function in other fields of endeavor. Put immediately to work, she has, what she considers, only minor effect with her first session. Encouraged by the administrator, we watch her come back 'in top form'. And through the following weeks, she continues her valuable work. Then, at the end of one very special day, she is shocked to see that her last patient is not only the husband of one of her female patients, but also a powerful vision from her own past. Her reaction reveals her real identity and her oldest forms of therapy. It is that final therapy that resolves all the issues of both the family and the practitioner.
