The Swindlers of Doom

 "Captain" Bob McCain is the owner/operator of a military surplus starship who travels the galaxy with his motley crew looking to make ends meet any way possible including McCain's endless supply of cons and scams. They find easy marks in the people of the planet Girellia and after moving a near-by asteroid into a collision course with the planet, the crew convinces the Girellians that their planet is in danger. McCain offers to "save" the Girellians for a small fee the Girellians, including the leader's beautiful daughter and a scientist, are skeptical of the new arrivals. But, with no other choice, they agree to McCain's terms. Unfortunately, the second part of the scam goes wrong and the crew is confronted with the unthinkable. They may actually cause the destruction of the Girellians!!! McCain and his crew must decide whether to take the money and run or take responsibility and become the heroes the Girellians need them to be.
