Private Angelo

 Private Angelo has been conscripted into the Italian Army in WWII. The trouble is that Private Angelo doesn't like people shooting at him so he tries all sorts of tricks to avoid being caught up in the action. But however hard he tries to avoid it events always seem to lead him back to the fighting.
