The Sword of Monte Cristo

 In 1858 France, Emperor Louis Napoleon sends Captain Renault of the Royal Dragoons, Minister La Roche and Major Nicolet to Normandy in search of the members of a group of rebels. A Masked Cavalier, the niece, Lady Christianne, of the Marquis De Montableau, announces at a secret meeting of the Normandy underground leaders that the fabled treasure of Monte Cristo was willed to her and she will use it to finance their cause. Her uncle, the only one who can decipher the symbols on the sword of Monte Cristo, the key to the treasure, derides her stand against the Emperor. La Roche takes possession of the sword and has the Marquis put into the dungeon. Christianne, as the Masked Cavalier, regains the sword from La Roche, but Captain Renault apprehends her and returns to sword to La Roche. After the Imperial coach is attacked, Emperor Louis Napoleon III's half-brother Charles La Roche forces him to sign an edict allowing for the arrest and imprisonment of rebels without trial. The leader of the rebels is Lady Christianne, the Masked Cavalier, whose uncle and guardian was the Count of Monte Cristo's best friend, and who inherited the count's vast wealth. She is prepared to use the vast fortune to finance a revolution but when the commander of the guard, Captain Renault, learns of her secret identity, he tries to deliver Monte Cristo's sword - the key to locating the treasure - to the Emperor. La Roche has him removed and placed under guard but he manages to escape and with Christianne tries to stop him.
