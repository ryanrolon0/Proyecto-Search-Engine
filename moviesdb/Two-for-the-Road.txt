The film follows their life together --- through courtship and marriage, infidelity and parenthood --- all on the road in a variety of cars through a score of time-shifting vignettes. The ten-year marriage of Mark and Joanna Wallace is on the rocks. In flashback they recall their first meeting, memorable moments in their courtship and early wedded life, their travels through Europe, their broken vow never to have children, and their increasing tensions that led to both of them having extra-marital affairs.
