Raising Dead

 When a college student, Jason, realizes the death of his best friend is more than it seems, he tries to make sense of the mystery with the help of Police Chief Ted Arbogast. Arbogast admits that the friend's death is no shock to him and by no means the first. He tells Jason how the strange deaths and other acts of crime surrounding Stalling Falls are caused by an alien race trying to cure it's own problems. They use the bodies of their harvested victims and turn them into test drones to find a much needed cure for their disease. The story follows a young Ted Arbogast as he attempts to come to terms with this horrific turn of events and bring peace to the small town.
