 It happens now... In a region delimited by three boundaries, Italy, Austria and Slovenia, three stories, three protagonists Iranian and Muslim; Pavel, 32 years old, Ukrainian and Jewish; Irene, 25 years old, Carnic and Christian. There are three lives interweaving. Different individuality's. Mehdi is a rose-seller. He walks through the tables and ask the costumers. Nobody buys. Mehdi isn't zealous observes, looks around himself and then goes away. In another bar some regular customers get him involved in their night out and offer him something to drink. He doesn't refuse... Pavel is a butcher boy. Introvert and rational, perpetually unsatisfied, seeks for a point of reference. One day meets Irene, student at University, grown-up in an environment strongly Christian (she was educated by monsignor Angelo, who the girl considers as a father)... The girl is sensitive to boy's loneliness and between them more than a friendship is going to be born... A love story lines out around Pavel and Irene, and this story seems to lead the plot of the film... Three stories like so many others. Scraps of life. The contemporaneity and the interaction of the stories and different situations, the actions and the natural flow of events, between conditioning, predetermination, casualty, repetitiveness and indifference. A movie about the integration and the cohabitation. Does it mean also coexistence? Maybe... Mehdi, Pavel and Irene aren't really able to give themselves to the others. They seal their sufferings in their own heart, struggling between the desire to escape from the shadow and the will to stay in their own. Whereas the cohabitation with foreigners necessarily produces changes in habits, in culture, in every-day life, in love ... the three guys, victims of distrust and prejudice... The story is open to several dimensions, many real, unreal and surreal...
