The Champs Step Out

 In the third of four shorts in this series, two ex-prizefighters, Max Baer and Maxie Rosenbloom, are hired by an archaeologist, Professor Bentley, to guard a million dollars worth of antiques and relics in his home. During the night, each makes a play for the professor's secretary, Miss Pearson, who is working for a gang of crooks planning to rob the place. She slips them a mickey-finn but they come to soon enough to catch the crooks and save the relics.
