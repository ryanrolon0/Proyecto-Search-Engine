Wanting Alex

 Pete's in love with his roommate's girlfriend, a beautiful, quirky, and charming girl named Alex. They are never apart. They are best friends. But she is madly in love with the most effeminate heterosexual heartthrob since that guy from the Partridge Family. As far as Pete can tell, this is her only flaw. So now, the only obstacle to Pete's happiness is a self-involved, fedora wearing, TV star... We've all been there.
