Terminal Choice

 A patient in an hospital dies under mysterious circumstances. The attending doctor Fank Holt gets under suspect - he'd been fired already from his last position due to mispractice. For his defence he investigates with help of doctor Anna Lang. Soon they find out that half of their colleagues were betting on the patient's diagnosises - was someone trying to increase his chances? But when Frank's friend, dissector Mary Connor, becomes deadly sick, he suspects there's even more to it.
