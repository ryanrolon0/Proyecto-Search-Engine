Sanky Panky

 In Dominican Republic, the local Genaro works in a small family store and lives with his mother in a poor neighborhood. He is learning a couple of words in English and dreams on being a sanky-panky to get married to an American tourist to move to New York with a VISA and have a better life. He calls his friend Giussepe, who is the manager of a resort in Bávaro, and applies for a job position entertaining children but expecting to find a wealthy tourist. Genaro meets the gorgeous Martha, who has come from New Jersey with her fat aunts Dorothy and Helen, to forget her fiancE after calling off her wedding. Genaro calls his best friends, the womanizer Chelo and the gluttonous Carlitos, to date the aunts and live him alone with Martha. Martha only speak English and Genaro just know a couple of words in English, but everything works out the way he had schemed until the day Martha's boyfriend comes to the resort.
