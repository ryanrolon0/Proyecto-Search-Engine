The Male Groupie

 What happens when you're living the life...and it belongs to your best friend? Male Groupie tells the tale of two childhood friends, seemingly on the same path towards success but steadily drifting apart. Blase' Skippy is a multi-platinum rapper, actor, and businessman; and Ton who, while creative, lives vicariously through him. While Ton is behaving as if they were still in high school, "flossing" with Blase's money and fame, disrespecting women, and making decisions that will ultimately revolve around his friend's successful career. Blase' is moving toward a more mainstream, positive direction. We meet them on a not-so-typical night out, when their journey meets a bittersweet fork in the road.
