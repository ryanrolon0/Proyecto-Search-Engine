The Bajao

 Throughout the seas of Southeast Asia, there are nomadic families of the Bajao tribe, who spend their entire lives living on large sailing outrigger canoes. They live off the resources of the ocean and the thousands of small islands in this region. Yet they manage to have developed an interesting culture. We travel with them as they fish, collect sea-shells, trade them for food, cloth, etc. at villages, and join other Bajao families on remote islands for ceremonies.
