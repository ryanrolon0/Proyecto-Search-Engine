Walk the Fish

 Don has been going out of his mind. He's totally isolated himself and now wants to either live on a boat somewhere or be insane and productive like Charles Mingus. Only, he'd rather be with someone he cared about (or who cared about him) while on his existential journey. Too bad the women he meets don't get him; in fact, nobody on the eastern seaboard seems to care much about anything at all. Or maybe there's something wrong with him; maybe the problem is that he's the type of person who would walk a fish.
