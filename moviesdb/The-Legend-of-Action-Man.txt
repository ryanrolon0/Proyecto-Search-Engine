The Legend of Action Man

 In the quiet city of Sugar Land, one man fights to keep his city safe. Unfortunately, he's the one causing half the crimes, and Action Man is warned that if he steps out of line one more time he'll be put under house arrest. In comes Mark, a news intern looking for a story to get his work on the News, and Action Man seems like an interesting case. That is, until a murder is reported and the new duo suspects Jonathan Magnum, a suspicious millionaire who just moved in down the block. Can Action Man stop his first real villain, or is he in over his head?
