Stanley

 'What kind of man are you, a family man a lonely man or a Family man?' Stanley had his answer, he found it quite easily in fact, and was determined to make it a reality. 'I'm not trying anymore, I'm doing'. Stanley is released from an institution and attempts to rejoin society with a list of goals he is determined to see through.
