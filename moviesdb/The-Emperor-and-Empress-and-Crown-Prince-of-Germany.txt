The Emperor and Empress and Crown Prince of Germany

 A very fine portrait picture of the royal family of Germany, taken at Kiel on the occasion of the launching of the German cruiser "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse." The distinguished company passed very close to the camera, and as the negative is unusually good photographically, a splendid portrait of each is given.
