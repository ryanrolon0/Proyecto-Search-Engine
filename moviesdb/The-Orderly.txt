The Orderly

 A Southern Gothic comedy set in the early 50's about a timid orderly, Norville, that finds himself late for his first day of work and his first assignment hours away, with only 6 hours to get them there. With each minute and mile that passes, Norville desperately struggles to keep his own sanity along this tense, bizarre and chaotic ride.
