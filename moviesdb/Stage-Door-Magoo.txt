Stage Door Magoo

 Magoo has been enlisted as the male lead in Mrs. Sticknee's vanity production opera. On his way to the stage, he winds up in the rafters and causes havoc, cutting the various lines, standing in front of a spotlight, falling down stairs and trying to enter through a trap door the diva is standing on, and eventually crashing into a control board, triggering a snowstorm.
