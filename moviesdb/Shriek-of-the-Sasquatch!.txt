Shriek of the Sasquatch!

 It's 1979 and Julie (Scarlet Salem, "Strip Club Slasher") and Nick (Donny Versiga) are on a road trip which puts them unwittingly on a collision course with Bigfoot. Will either of them survive to learn the secret of the Sasquatch? Pseudo-retro drive-in fun, complete with film damage. Filmed in 2010.
