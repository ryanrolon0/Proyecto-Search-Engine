Summer Bachelors

 Derry Thomas is a pretty girl from a good family who earns her own living, but is disillusioned about marriage and is firmly set against ever getting married. Nothing against men, just marriage. She is drawn into the company of some rich businessmen whose wives have gone away for the summer. Parties follow in New York nightclubs, road-houses, country clubs and fashionable estates. Situations and contradictions follow.
