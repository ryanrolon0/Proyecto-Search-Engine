Shagi v solntse

 The Unknown Soldier wearing an original WWII uniform that have been ravaged by combat is intruding the peaceful life of Russian cities and sea resorts. The images of war presented by actual footage from WWII are shown in stark contrast with the gaiety of the 60's crowd in the Soviet Union. In the final scene children embrace the Unknown Soldier.
