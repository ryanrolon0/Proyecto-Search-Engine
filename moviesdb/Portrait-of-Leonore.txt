Portrait of Leonore

 In Portrait of Leonore, a stylized, autobiographical short film, director Peter Jin copes with depression by creating a make-believe sister - a sister he might have had if his mother did not have an abortion - and indulges in fond, pretend memories of his otherwise unhappy childhood.
