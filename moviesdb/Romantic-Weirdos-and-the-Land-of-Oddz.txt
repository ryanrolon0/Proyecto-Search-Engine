Romantic Weirdos and the Land of Oddz

 Romantic Weirdos and the Land of Oddz is an intimate journey into the lives of four emotionally scarred kids who grow up unable to function normally in society. Each living separately as a pariah in his community, these four kids find each other as adults and go on a journey of self-discovery together. Along the way they meet a weird assortment of characters that help them to uncover the truth about their past and find purpose and meaning in their lives. Like the journey along the yellow brick road in The Wizard of Oz these four friends seek answers throughout the roads of Hollywood.
