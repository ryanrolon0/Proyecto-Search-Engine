The Way Back

 Inspired by Charles Dickens 'A Child's Story'. Theme of return of the prodigal son .. with a modern twist, pops in the subconscious of the narrator, mysteriously injected into his 'way back' to his home, family, roots. It is a remembrance & reflection on the past two decades in the life of Russia.
