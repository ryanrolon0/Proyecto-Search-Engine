The Second Time Around

 Two mice find themselves in a hunter's shed and come across the scattered bones of a Lynx. They begin to reconstruct the skeleton which causes the bones to awaken. The mice facilitate in the reincarnation of a new creature, who is given one more moment of life. The mice invite the Lynx back and then tuck it away again. This is my first stop motion animation, made in my cabin in West Dawson, YT. The idea began with the found Lynx Skeleton on 3rd avenue in Dawson City.
