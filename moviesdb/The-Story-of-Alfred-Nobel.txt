The Story of Alfred Nobel

 The story of the career of Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite as a constructive force for good, and lived to see it become a maiming-and-killing weapon of war. A mother, whose son was maimed in war, brings Nobel to the son's bedside, where he realizes the horrific use his invention had been put to. He then created the Nobel Awards, for the outstanding annual achievement in the cause of world peace.
