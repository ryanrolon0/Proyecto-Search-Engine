The Sea Ghost

 Greg Winters, a disgraced World War 1 naval officer, is the Captain of a salvage-ship in New Orleans in 1925. He crosses paths with Evelyn Inchcape, a man-hating owner of a cabaret and the heir to a fortune, and Karl Ludwig, a former German submarine commander, searching for salvation on the docks of New Orleans.
