Scribble's Creations

 18-year-old Fernando Paez typically spends his days drawing graffiti with his tagging crew along the U.S.-Mexico border. The unexpected pregnancy of his girlfriend, however, forces him to make some drastic life changes. With much of the shooting completed by Fernando and other local teenagers, Scribble's Creations is an intimate portrait of an individual who must grow up quickly in a world of few resources and opportunities.
