Pull to Pieces

 The film begins with Nathan and Rachel at conception. Three months later, Nathan must sit in the waiting room while his girlfriend Rachel goes through an abortion. We follow two time periods as certain events in the waiting room remind him of his past relationship. A purse reminds him of the first time he met Rachel; A medical form sparks a memory of their first long distance phone call; A pair of young teenagers going through tests reminds him of his last Christmas and later his fight with Rachel that eventually led him to a decision to end the relationship. The story shows us that it isn't always easy to know the way to react to a situation until it falls in your lap.
