The Spiritual Cockroach

 A man encounters a dead cockroach in his beverage, almost swallowing it. Later, after much inner turmoil and introspection, the man comes to believe that the Dalai Lama sent him the cockroach to help him overcome his fears and elevate him to a higher level of consciousness and communion with all life. Based on the "real-life" experience of Jerry DeShazo.
