The Battle of the Broken Spoons

 The Battle of the Broken Spoons is a documentary about a group of miscreants and their struggles to succeed, scraping by with little or no budgets while producing several shorts and feature-length films, and the harsh reality of how difficult it is to be recognized in the film industry. They are an eclectic crew ranging from ex-cons to real-life circus clowns, gang members to members of the gay community; a most unique mob of misfits that met at The Art Institute of Colorado, and found that they had much more in common than drinking problems.
