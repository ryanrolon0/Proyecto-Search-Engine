Sunny Side Up

 Josh, a high school student, turns to drugs in order to cope with the recent death of his father and to escape the tyranny of his alcoholic mother. His addiction leads him to the office of a sinister, megalomaniacal psychiatrist who's motives extend far beyond helping a troubled teen. Josh's best friend Seth is there by his side every step of the way. But, when Josh gets his hands on a new experimental drug, Seth begins to witness his best friend's addiction turn into homicidal tendencies.
