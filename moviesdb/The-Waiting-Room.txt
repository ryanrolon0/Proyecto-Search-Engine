The Waiting Room

 A railway platform Kent, 1916. A winter's night. A train pulls into the platform. A solitary woman steps off the train, an Edwardian nurse. Her face is distraught, her eyes are haunted. She walks towards the one building on the platform, she reaches for the handle past the painted sign the 'Waiting Room'. She opens the door and enters, closing it behind her. A single gun shot is heard, a screech of brakes, a scream of terror. The same platform ninety years later, November 2010, Julian Creed, late thirties, tough, burly, a retired soldier, has been employed to investigate some strange happenings at The Waiting room. He enters and begins a night he will never forget. A film about the horror of lost love.
