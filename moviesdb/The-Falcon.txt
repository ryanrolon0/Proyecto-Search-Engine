The Falcon

 Part I hero, Professor Weston and his companion, Howell 'the Owl', journey throughout the Focal Kingdom, searching for a decent meal. Meanwhile, at home on the Nikonian Range, our villain, Silly Patty, whose own inner struggle between over and under exposure sheds light on an even wider Depth of Field, is preoccupied with the pursuit of the Forbidden f/stop. Part II Before long, the wind winds its way through the Focal distance to the Prismatic Pyramids of Polaroid, and we witness a classic struggle over the Proper Aspect Ratio between Professor Weston and Silly Patty, provoking a storm of thunderous CumuloKodak Clouds that relentlessly unleash sheets of Rolleiflex Rain, until R. Control is restored. After the clouds part, the odyssey continues to the Hasselblad Hills, where the sun sets, the Leica Lakes (APO) spill down through Canon Canyons, the Mamiya in the Moon (some say Minolta), begins its nightly climb around the horizon, and Howell and the rest continue their quest. Part III perspective to the shimmering light that's fading in the Olympus Ocean, where, among a few interlopers, we catch a rare exposure of the Foctopi (888mm). But as light dims even darker in the viewfinder of day, the sprockets of life must complete their daily cycle, and we witness the light of sustenance, as it's captured by the creatures in the Focal Kingdom, and by the instant-peel color iris film of our ocular sockets, before we finally reach the end of the roll.
