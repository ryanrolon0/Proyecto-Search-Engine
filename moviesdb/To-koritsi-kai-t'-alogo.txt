To koritsi kai t' alogo

 An Egean artist sees his younger wife and his son (from a previous marriage) making incestuous love, decides to paint such a beautiful scene on a canvas, especially with them riding her white stallion. The lovers can't know what the strange arrangements mean, and are afraid the painter suspects their relationship. When they try to leave the house, the painter's madness explodes, and Greek tragedy settles on the family.
