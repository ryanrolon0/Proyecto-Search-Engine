Showreel

 A young actor captures the imagination of an anonymous documentary filmmaker hunting for a subject. Alex allows the camera to follow him around town as he confronts the hardships of an artist's poverty concerns of a disapproving family, drunken daydreams, the banality of unemployment. Still, sharing his struggles lifts Alex's eager spirits and, soon enough, he lands a minor role in an experimental stage adaptation of Peeping Tom, the cult classic of a voyeur who films his own murderous obsessions. When Alex is suddenly thrust into the leading role and simultaneously meets a young woman, he finds it difficult to leave his mania in the rehearsal hall.
