Strange But True

 It centers on a young man forced to return home to his divorced mother, who never fully accepted the death of her younger son from a limo accident the night of his senior prom. Another chain of events is set off when the son's high school girlfriend shows up on the family's doorstep five years after the accident, claiming to be pregnant with his child.
