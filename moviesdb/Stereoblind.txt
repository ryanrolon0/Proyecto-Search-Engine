Stereoblind

 A unique docu-dance that explores the experience of learning to see in 3D for the first time. A poetic and provocative statement, this short film is based on the director's quest to expand her visual perception by training her eyes and brain to perceive in stereo. Interweaving personal narrative, choreography, and inspiring interviews with prominent neuroscientists V.S. Ramachandran, MD, PhD, and Susan R. Barry, PhD, 'Stereoblind' prompts us to wonder about our own perceptual limitations and possibilities.
