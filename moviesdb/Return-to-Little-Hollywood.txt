Return to Little Hollywood

 'Return to Little Hollywood' brings attention to the history of the film industry's presence in Southern Utah, where great movies like 'Western Union,' 'MacKenna's Gold,' and 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' were filmed. It not only includes footage of old sets and the region's magnificent landscape, but also interviews with stars who worked there.
