Swink

 In a small town, suburb to no city-- Eddie Swink has a problem. He has one day to find a killer hired to take out his boss, and all he has to go on is a murdered waiter, a pen, a plant, and some lasagna. With only a year of professional criminality under his belt, Eddie is caught between his duties and his instincts, and must decide who he can trust, and who he must stop. He needs answers, and he needs them now!
