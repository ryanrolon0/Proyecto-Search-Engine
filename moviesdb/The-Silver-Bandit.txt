The Silver Bandit

 Tycoon Van Fleet Stooglehammer, owner of the Green Valley silver mine, sends his mild-mannered, milquetoast bookkeeper, Spade Cooley, out to investigate the robberies of his silver-wagons being pulled off by a masked-man, riding a golden palomino, known as the Silver Bandit. Spade, who can't ride or fight and can barely sing, still makes an impression on Molly Doren, sister of Frank Doren, superintendent of the mine, and makes an enemy of Sam Morrell, the mine manager. Spade suspects either Frank of Sam as being the Silver Bandit, but the sheriff, figuring nobody could be as inept as Spade, has his eye on Spade...especially after he nabs Spade riding...uh...trying to ride the bandit's horse and wearing his costume. The owner of a silver mine, having repeatedly been the victim of the Silver Bandit, sends his clerk Spade Cooley who can neither ride nor fight west to investigate. The Sheriff has been unable to catch the bandit but when Spade finds him he will have to both ride and fight to bring him in.
