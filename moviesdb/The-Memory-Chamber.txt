The Memory Chamber

 An astronaut, drifting hopelessly into outer space, living entirely in his own memories of life on Earth. But it is also possible that the space ship is only a recurring series of bad dreams, and he is really only living the life of a failed novelist whose mind is beginning to disintegrate. This film explores the idea that perhaps both can be true.
