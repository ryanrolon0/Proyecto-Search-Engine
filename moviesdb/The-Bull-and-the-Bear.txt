The Bull and the Bear

 The Bull enters the Stock Exchange and walks over to the ticker, but the reports just coming in do not suit and he plainly shows his displeasure by facial expression and gestures. When the Bear appears, he shows his pleasure by happy exultation. Finally the reports make a change and the countenances of the two brokers change also. A fine picture for facial expression and cannot fail to please.
