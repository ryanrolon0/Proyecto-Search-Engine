Sepuluh Tahun Sebelum Merdeka

 October 20th, 1947 was a historical day in the Malayan people's constitutional struggle for independence from British colonialism. This documentary chronicles the events that culminated in the Malaya-wide 'Hartal' day of protest against the undemocratic Federation of Malaya Constitutional Proposals devised by the British Colonial Government, and the rise of the people's democratic movement in Malaya, ten years before independence.
