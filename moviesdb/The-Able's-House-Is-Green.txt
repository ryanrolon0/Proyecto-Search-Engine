The Able's House Is Green

 Peter and Andrew haven't seen each other in years. Reunited on the lake where they spent their summers as kids to attend the funeral of a mutual friend, Peter finds that his past is not as concrete and stable as perhaps he needs it to be right now. Searching around the shore of the lake for something to be as it was, Peter is confronted with change at every turn in the last place he expects to find it. The film examines our resistance to change and the idea that sometimes something very small or seemingly insignificant can be the watershed for great change.
