 Stergiou is a wrestling manager and he sets up fights. His goal is to take Souglakos (a poor but decent wrestler) by his side. Souglakos denies to conform with the powerful Stergiou and as a result, he must deal with Stergiou's mafia! They kidnap and rape his sister (who happens to be a virgin!). That's when he's forced to fight against the "Black Panther," a huge and gruesome wrestler!
