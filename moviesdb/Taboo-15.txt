Taboo 15

 Doctor Max is a dedicated psychiatrist counseling patients with troubled family histories. Through reenactment therapy, his clients re-think their most traumatic sexual experiences. The Doctor is quite successful in relieving their sense of guilt, but it's his assistant Jen Teal and a very special Dominatrix who must reactivate their sexuality. They soon discover that the good doctor suffers from a malady far worse than his patient's. But, to discuss it further her would be Taboo.
