Rock Around the Clock

 A frustrated big-band promoter runs in to rock-and-rollers Bill Haley and the Comets at a small-town dance. He quickly becomes their manager and, with the help of Alan Freed, hopes to bring the new sound to the entire country. But will a conniving booking agent, with a personal ax to grind with the manager, conspire to keep the band from making the big time? The first true rock and roll feature film, Rock Around the Clock is a highly fictionalized account of the discovery of rock and roll by small-time promoter Steve Hollis, when Hollis visits a small town to find Bill Haley and the Comets packing in the crowds. Hollis also finds time for romance with teenage dancer Lisa. The main purpose of the film was to introduce Haley to a worldwide film audience. The band was joined by fellow rockers Freddie Bell and the Bellboys along with The Platters for this early rock musical. This film was banned in many countries after reports of teenagers ripping up the seats in their excitement over the loud, raucous music on the soundtrack, though today the film is more likely to spur nostalgia.
