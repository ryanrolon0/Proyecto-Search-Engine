 On August 26, 1990, the House of the Bulgarian Communist Party in Sofia, Bulgaria, was set on fire. The event was documented material evidence, expert reports. Tens of people were indicted, hundreds were interrogated, there were thousands of witnesses and yet, for 15 years, the case did not make it to the court. Finally - to the relief of all known and unknown participants - it was prescribed. 18 years later, a team decided to shed light on this Bulgarian nebulosity. The documentary invites the audience to become the jury in a trial that never took place.
