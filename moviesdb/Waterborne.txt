Waterborne

 Heera Bhatti, an American-Sikh, runs a corner store in Los Angeles with the help of her son, Vikram, and Gulu. She does not approve of Vikram's Caucasian girlfriend, Lillian, and would prefer that Vikram marry a Punjabi girl, but Vikram has made up his mind. Then the lives of all Californians are turned upside down when one morning eight people are dead after drinking contaminated tap water. The State goes on alert, with troopers and the police stepping up to ensure that the culprits (Al Qaeda?) are caught. But then the locals have to content with the instructions contact with tap water for 72 hours. That means no one can wash their face, hands, feet, shower, shave nor drink water - the life saving ingredient that has been taken so much for granted. Watch as Heera, Vikram and Lillian comes to term with this emergency, how Heera jacks the price of bottled water, and the impact this emergency has on the community.
