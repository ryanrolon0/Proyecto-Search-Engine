Sanzaru

 Witnessing the murder of his father and the rape of his mother by the same three men, mummy's boy Junyang decides to kill them off in the manner of Sanzaru (Japanese for 'see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil'). However, things are never the way they seem to be. Perhaps the men who destroyed his life did not act on the motives Junyang assumed.
