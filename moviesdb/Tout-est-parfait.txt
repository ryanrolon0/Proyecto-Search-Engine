Tout est parfait

 Josh is an ordinary teen living in an ordinary suburb, wedged between the high school, the mine and the skate park. One morning, he finds his friend Thomas's dead body. Next, he discovers that three more friends also killed themselves, leaving him out of their pact. As the sole survivor, Josh becomes more and more detached from the world around him. Only Mia, his best friend's girl, can reach him. With more questions than answers, Josh's is the story of a survivor. It is a modern portrait of today's teens invincible yet fragile, clear-thinking yet confused, idealistic yet jaded.
