Voglia di sesso

 Since Charlie passed away one year ago, his niece Romana and his daughter Francesca have been leading a solitary life, almost never leaving the house they inherited, reading and playing the piano. Romana seems fine, but Francesca, being the younger, grows increasingly weary of the situation. She is in dire need of sexual activity. When Roberto, an old family acquaintance, drops by to pay a visit, Francesca is all over him and invites him to stay for three days. Romana, though wanting to live in romantic love for her late uncle Charlie, fosters secret desires for Roberto as well. She has different things to offer than mere sex food, and conversation. A rivalry between the two cousins develops. How will Roberto cope with the situation?
