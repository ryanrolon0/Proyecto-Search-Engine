 What's a girl to do when her biological clock is ticking, yet marriage and a husband are the furthest thing from her mind? SILENT MEN follows the trials and tribulations of one very modern-minded young woman, Patricia, as she tries to plan out her motherhood. With the enlisted help of her best friend Liam she interviews on video dozens of men to find a suitable potential father for her child. But there's a catch be platonic!
