Spunk

 Comedy Central's five minute short that played during the 1994 Olympic games. Tina Yothers plays Tonya Harding, who is portrayed as a misunderstood skater, but likeable for her spunk. Nancy Kerrigan decides she needs to do something to benefit herself in the headlines. So she plans an attack on herself and pins Harding as the mastermind behind it. Will this accusation dim Tonya's spunk as the Olympics approach?
