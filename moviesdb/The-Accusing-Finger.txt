The Accusing Finger

 An attorney is responsible for sending an innocent man to jail for a murder he did not commit. He soon gets a taste of his own medicine when his wife is murdered and no one will believe him when he claims he didn't do it. A prosecuting District Attorney, proud of his 100% record of convictions in mostly death-penalty cases, finds himself, because of circumstantial evidence, on the other side of the fence, and soon finds himself in the same situation and in company with many of the people he has sent to prison, some unjustly.
