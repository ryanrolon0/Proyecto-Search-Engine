The Domestication of Humans

 Takes place from dusk till dawn during two parties at the homes of the affluent Thomas and Newman families. Ted Newman, reels from spliff to spliff; deeply dissatisfied with the compromises he has made for his wife Carol and their two sons. Chance Thompson is an ambitious young writer, newly graduated from university, just returned home from overseas, hungers for a more meaningful existence than her parents. Over the course of the night, both parties culminate in ultimate spiritual and emotional chaos.
