Psycho-Path

 The Banewood Asylum houses the mentally ill who have become victims of unethical procedures and mad doctors. Patients have disappeared or been found dead under suspicious circumstances. Young women seem to be the victims most often of a medical staff who's methods hearken to the dark days of psychiatric treatments. The doctors like to use Psycho-Surgery to remove parts of their brains to quell the patients violent tendencies, at times turning them into little more than zombies, that become more violent than ever.
