The City of Comrades

 A young man becomes a burglar due to hunger, but after gathering up his booty feeds himself from the victims' larders, and thus, no longer hungry, feels compelled to return the loot. In one case, he is discovered in the act by a young lady who finds in him a suitable case for reclamation.
