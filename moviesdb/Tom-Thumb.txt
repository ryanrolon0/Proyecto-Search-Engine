Tom Thumb

 A stork delivers a baby no bigger than a thumb to two proud parents. The boy ages, but does not grow. Despite Tom's diminutive size, he attempts everyday tasks like helping his mother in the kitchen and learning to play the piano. However, adventuresome Tom finds trouble when he disobeys his father and ventures into the outside world.
