Un azard habanero

 Cuba is a country in fast evolution. The youths are in ferment; they are seeking new routes to let themselves be known as well as new languages to communicate in any artistic form - from music to literature, to cinema and the visual arts. The ground where these young artists are living is no longer a restricted and closed area like that of a socialist country which, as happened in the past, is supposed to be isolated from the rest of the world. They are living in a developing country that is constantly renewing itself. There the new generations manage to process and change their own tradition with what they learn from foreign cultures, both in form and in content. This documentary did not come out of a programme but out of casual encounters. Thus it tries to draw a map among the new Cuban generations that use art as a means of communication. We found an intimist painting that analyzes man's inner core from a universal point of view, explores it and separates it from its peculiarly Cuban context; a fresh and sharp literature that is no longer concerned with what can be written and what cannot, because young writers have found out that the worst censorship inhabits within ourselves; and a totally anti-traditional music, hard and cutting rock sung by too-long muffled voices that now want to scream and wake up all those that do not perceive times are changing.
