The Grandfathers

 A young man searches for his identity deep in the Amazon jungle, while living among the tribe that murdered his grandfather decades earlier. The Grandfathers is a motion-graphics documentary completing Jim Hanon's inspiring trilogy begun with Beyond the Gates of Splendor and followed by End of the Spear. These films were produced by Mart Green. Jesse Saint struggles to find his place in a world dominated by the memory of a famous grandfather he never knew and a heroic father he could not understand. Years spent living among the Waodani and befriending the three old men who took part in his grandfather's murder teach Jesse the healing power of dignity, respect and forgiveness. In the jungle, Jesse must confront his family's past as he determines his own future. This documentary is a moving tribute to a young boy's quest for significance and wholeness, and its imprint on three old men, who, unwittingly, are on a quest of their own.
