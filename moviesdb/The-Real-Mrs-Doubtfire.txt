The Real Mrs Doubtfire

 In March 2006, in a small town in Tennessee, a nanny, Erika Sadowski, disappeared with two young girls in her care. The next day, they were found stranded in a remote area near the Mississippi river. The day after that, Erika was discovered to be a transsexual man, who had been living as a woman and working as a nanny for nearly 20 years. This film combines drama and documentary to tell the story of the alleged kidnapping and how it polarized opinion in The South. It's also a detective story in which nothing proves to be as it first appeared.
