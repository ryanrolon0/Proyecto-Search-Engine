T.I.N.F.

 TINF utilizes the design of a movie trailer to tell several stories. The first story involves detectives searching for the truth. The second story reveals two lonely people searching for passion. The third story entails a scientist searching for the ultimate theory. The fourth story is TINF. The central theme revolves around the notion that experience is brief and ephemeral, yet mysteriously unified; often producing more questions than answers. After all, life is like a coming attraction; it leaves us wanting more.
