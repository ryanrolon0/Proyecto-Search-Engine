 Cynthia's abusive father is dead. She compulsively cleans her childhood home in an attempt to exorcise him from every room, while her mother, Ruth, rests upstairs, one last bruise on her face to remember him by. When Cynthia's estranged brother, Matthew, returns home, Cynthia is forced to come to terms with her mother's denial, the family's deeply ingrained dysfunction and her own complicity. Can Cynthia free herself from her father's clutches or will she forever be tied to this place?
