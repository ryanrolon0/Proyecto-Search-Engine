The Last Lap

 Based on a true story, Leonard, a Chicago-based correspondent for NBC's "Today" show, hits the road for a month in a rented RV with his eccentric parents. As they visit the places and people that have influenced their lives, they're trailed by a second RV, driven by Leonard's three children.
