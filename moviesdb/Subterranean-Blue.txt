Subterranean Blue

 Finally taking the plunge, three friends from Brighton decide to move to London. Their plans are good, but their fortunes are not, as Ali spirals out of control with Taryn fighting to hold the friendship together, as Charlie makes the sofa here new home. Sex, betrayal, poetry, loss, men, and daytime television all prove to be a lethal concoction in this film about friendship and uncontrollable PMT.
