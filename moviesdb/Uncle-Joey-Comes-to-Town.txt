Uncle Joey Comes to Town

 The spry, fun-loving, genial and enterprising Uncle Joey Mouse comes to the big city to visit his nephews who live in the basement of a large mansion. The butler sets the dining table elaborately for a meal, but the mice have other ideas; they scurry up on the table and, using the tableware and food for equipment, start a baseball game.
