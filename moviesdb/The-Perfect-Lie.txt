The Perfect Lie

 Neely and his bitter rival are both in love with Betty but both are rejected by her father, an irate Scotsman who is an avid golfer. An 18-hole golf game is suggested, with the winner getting the fair hand of the fair Betty. Neely can't even hit a ball, so when the 18th hole is reached, the rival is ready to claim Betty as his bride, but Betty has other plans that will determine the winner.
