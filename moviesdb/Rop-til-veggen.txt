Rop til veggen

 One single incident can totally revolt a person's way of viewing his life. Just like that, Bjørnar Tron receives a letter posted to his ex-girlfriend Linn. By reflex he crumples the letter immediately, only too late to see that he is being watched. He gradually realizes that he's been totally numbed ever since Linn left him. Bjørnar starts an awkward but desperate search for help. How could one fight one's rapidly growing sense of solitude when one does not know whom to turn to?
