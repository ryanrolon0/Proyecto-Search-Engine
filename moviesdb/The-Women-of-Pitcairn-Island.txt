The Women of Pitcairn Island

 Eighteen years have passed since the arrival of the Bounty mutineers on Pitcairn Island. The last of these mutineers has just died and the island is now populated solely by their widows and children including Thursday October Christian, son of Fletcher Christian. Onto this island now comes a band of shipwrecked sailors, bringing with them a lust for women and a greed for black pearls.
