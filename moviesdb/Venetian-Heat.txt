Venetian Heat

 1943, Italy, the Venetian countryside. The country is in turmoil as Mussolini's government is losing power and Hitler's invasion is imminent. Terrified soldiers are fleeing their posts rather than fight for a regime in which they no longer believe. On an isolated farmhouse a young couple's marriage is breaking down as two deserters arrive. A romantic drama unfolds as the younger soldier starts an affair with the wife, whilst the other awakens a newly-found passion in the husband. In a time before homosexuality is tolerated, can their love survive? Or will the narrow-minded fanaticism of the Nazis, the Fascists and the Catholic Church tear them apart? Based on real events and revealing the truth of the Gay Holocaust, "Venetian Heat" is a riveting story of passion and love versus bigotry and hate.
