Sesto continente

 Long underwater documentary, and sort of a scientific diary, with a group of scientists, sportsmen and journalists, filmed at the Red Sea, around the Dahlak Islands, the Egyptian coastal, Sudan and Eritrea, the desert Brother and Zabargadh islands, and the calm waters of Gubbet Mus Nefit Bay, the coral forest of Shawdan. Sharks, barracuda, venomous fish and deadly mantas add excitement to the sharp black and water photography.
