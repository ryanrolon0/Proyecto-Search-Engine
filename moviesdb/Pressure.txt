Pressure

 This is a coming of age story about five teenagers growing up in Harlem New York in the 1980's. It is the beginning of a new generation of kids called the "hip hop" generation, which unfortunately was growing up alongside the "crack cocaine" generation. Karon falls into a deep sleep after his graduation in 1985. Having dreams within dreams takes him into a realistic drama along with his potential future in the 1990's as a drug selling youth. His fast money attitude serves as the detriment to the community and ultimately his best friends become caught in the crossfire of his illicit activity. He awakens back in 1985, realizing the "easy way out" that was offered wasn't a glorious new beginning, it was the end.
