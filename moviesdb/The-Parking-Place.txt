The Parking Place

 The Parking Place takes the war of the car park to the next level in the form of a ridiculous situation comedy drama about two men, Dr. George (Hugh Hemmings) and Peter (Tony Champion) who fight over a particular space in a car park with limited parking facilities. Both men come from opposite ends of society, but end up in the same social position doing whatever it takes in a bid to claim the space before the other does.
