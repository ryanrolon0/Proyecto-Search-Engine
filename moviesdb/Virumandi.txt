Virumandi

 A reporter (Rohini) researching the death penalty in India is recounted the story of a farm owner Virumandi (Kamal) whose role in a clan feud between Naicker (Napoleon) and Kothalla Devar (Pasupathi) leads him to death row. As the story unfolds, there is a riot in the jail, and the only one who can get the reporter safely out of the prison is Virumandi.
