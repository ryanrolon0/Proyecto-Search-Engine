Trespassing World Cities

 Trespassing World Cities records how I struggled away from the tourist video style to seek for an impersonal form to pose my response to a world of big cities whose individual distinctive is increasingly blurred. This is a travel journal in the literal sense of the term. The video records my walking through a dozen of major cities around the world, repeating routes and activities, between 1999 and 2005. The mythology of the multiple colors of diverse world cultures shatters. I found myself doing the same things, repeating places I have visited, and inside my mind is often a totally different world irrelevant to the places I visit. Globalization is a popular catch word, the token of economism. Personally speaking, it is a form of irony.
