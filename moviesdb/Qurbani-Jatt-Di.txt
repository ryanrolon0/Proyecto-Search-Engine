Qurbani Jatt Di

 After Sarpanch Sucha Singh attempts to stop Joginder Dhiba, who is the brother of his sister-in-law, Jeeto, from sexually molesting Kamli, a physical confrontation ensues, resulting in the death of Joginder. Sucha is arrested, tried in Court, and sentenced to life in prison. Not satisfied with this, the three brothers of the deceased attempt to break-up Jeeto's marriage with Jagroop, and also prevent her look-alike sister, Pritam, from getting married to Sucha's brother, Karamjeet, setting off a feud that will result in more acrimony, and many more deaths.
