The Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie

 Something is rotten at the Elsinore Brewery. Bob and Doug Mackenzie (as seen on SCTV) help the orphan Pam regain the brewery founded by her recently-deceased father. But to do so, they must confront the suspicious brewmaster and two teams of vicious hockey players. Based on Shakespeare's _Hamlet_. Bob and Doug Mackenzie play the roles Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. A hilarious (and accurate) representation.
