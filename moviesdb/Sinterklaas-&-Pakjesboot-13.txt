Sinterklaas & Pakjesboot 13

 Sinterklaas and his Pieten are on their way to the Netherlands, on their new ship Pakjesboot 13. However, the ship is way too heavily loaded and sinks in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The Sint and his Pieten scurry of to a deserted island and luckily all manage to reach it alive. But, how will they now reach the Netherlands...?
