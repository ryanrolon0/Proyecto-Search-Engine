Violist op sterk water

 The documentary 'Violist op Sterk Water' ('Fiddler on Ice') gives a personal insight in the life of the famous and gifted fiddler Jacques Holtman. The filmmaker, Noud Holtman, is his cousin. The film slowly shows how the reality of everyday life is very different from idealized thoughts on living the free life of an artist.
