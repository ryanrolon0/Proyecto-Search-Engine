The Code Conspiracy

 What if a computer disc held a code so powerful that it could change the world forever? While translating the Dead Sea Scrolls, a professor discovers a hidden formula that not only unlocks all known computer encryption, but also scientifically proves the existence of God! Religions, governments and mankind itself could rise and fall based on this information. Now the faith of one man is the only thing standing in the way of unscrupulous government agents and deadly corporate mercenaries who will stop at nothing to get the disc.
