The 13th Gate

 The 13th Gate revolves around a pair of college students that travel to a small town in Louisiana to complete their film school video thesis about a deceased child killing devil worshiper named Angus Greene. Murdered some 40 years ago, Greene's proposed path of rage has lingered in this small town all the way up to present day, where now a very popular Halloween haunted amusement attraction resides on the very grounds he once owned. Mysterious accidental deaths have piled up every year since this venue has opened, which is called THE 13TH GATE, only adding to local suspicion about this area being cursed by the evil that most Louisiana folks believe Greene represents. On this one very dark night, these filmmakers on a mission to capture answers will find out if these myths are just made up folklore or if this vicious evil really is real!
