Treatment

 All his life, Leonard ('Joshua Leonard' (qv), _Humpday (2009)_ (qv)) has dreamed of being a famous filmmaker, but he's better at making excuses than making art. A chance encounter with a wasted A-list movie star ('Ross Partridge' (qv), _Baghead (2008)_ (qv)) could be his lucky break. All he has to do is come up with $15,000 to join the actor at a luxury rehab facility, where their friendship can blossom into wealth and glory. Leonard checks into treatment under false pretenses, but soon discovers that addiction comes in many forms. A daring farce with serious dramatic underpinnings, Treatment is about the lies we tell ourselves in order to live, and the price we pay when we start to believe them. It also features a rich supporting ensemble, including 'Brie Larson' (qv) (_Greenberg (2010)_ (qv)), 'John Hodgman' (qv) (The Daily Show, _Coraline (2009)_ (qv)), cult singer/ songwriter 'Robyn Hitchcock' (qv) ('Jonathan Demme' (qv)'s _Storefront Hitchcock (1998)_ (qv)), and writer/co-director 'Sean Nelson (III)' (qv) (_My Effortless Brilliance (2008)_ (qv), _The Freebie (2010)_ (qv)).
