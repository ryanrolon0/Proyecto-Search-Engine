Script Girl

 A movie director needs a script girl and a strip girl, misunderstanding the job title, shows up. Cross&Dunn are the stars of the movie-within-the-movie, and they perform "A Hamburger for Madame." Claire Carleton and the Gae Foster Girls provide added decoration and special effects of one kind or another.
