The Potts

 It is a new day, a new age of creativity for the hit man game when Johnny Potts and the gang take names that reflect their methods of murder. But like any tight knit crew, there is always someone trying to steal the thunder. In this comedy short, The Cookie, challenges The Potts in a classic showdown to determine who is the most creative, or should I say innovative, hit man on the scene.
