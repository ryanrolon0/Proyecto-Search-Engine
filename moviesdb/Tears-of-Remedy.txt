Tears of Remedy

 There's a bar with a magnificent entrance, but the business here is not wine. SANG, the owner of the bar, also owns a singer, LUNA. This singer is not like anybody else on this planet, her voice seems to possess the magic power that could make every man fall in love with her. However, she is not meant to be loved as she does not have emotions and will not love them back. Eventually, men give up their love for Luna by giving Sang their tears after they smoke her cigars. LEON, a once cold, relentless syndicate associate, works for the Big Boss. Like every other man, he enters this mysterious bar one day, and his life changes since - he goes on an unknown journey ever since that night, a journey filled with desires and conscience, dignity and sacrifice, trust and betrayal...He may be that special one in that bar, but all this could end up to be a cruel joke. There's no way of finding out, only destiny.
