Voices from Dupont Circle

 Dupont Circle is a special place, and the intention of this film is to convey its uniqueness. The neighborhood is dense, chaotic, diverse, infuriating, frenetic, yet serene and empathetic at the same time.   This virtual visit will give you an insiders view of the Dupont Circle community located in Washington, DC. 'See its people, hear the music, and FEAR THE TRAFFIC!'
