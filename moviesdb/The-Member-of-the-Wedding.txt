The Member of the Wedding

 A film version of the Carson McCullers play. Frankie Addams, a very boyish articulate 12-year-old girl, is going through an unhappy stage of her life, having been spurned by the neighborhood girls. She spends most of her time in the kitchen talking to her black maid, Bernice, and the younger next door boy, John Henry. Her brother Jarvis is about to marry Janice, and Frankie imagines that she will leave town with them. However she eventually begins to grow up into a young woman. A virtual "tour de force" for Julie Harris about a young tomboy named Frankie who is forced to face her own immaturity as a result her older brother's wedding.
