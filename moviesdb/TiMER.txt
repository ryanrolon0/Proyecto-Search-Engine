TiMER

 When implanted in a person's wrist, a TiMER counts down to the day the wearer finds true love. But Oona O'Leary faces the rare dilemma of a blank TiMER. Her soul mate - whoever and wherever he is - has yet to have a TiMER implanted. Staring down the barrel of thirty and tired of waiting for her would-be life partner to get off the dime, Oona breaks her own rules and falls for Mikey, a charming and inappropriately young supermarket clerk with a countdown of four months. In the near future, people can put a timer on their wrist that counts down until they meet their soul mate, as long as that person also has a timer. Step-sisters Oona and Steph, nearly 30, are slaves to their timers won't go off for years and Oona's is blank (her soul mate doesn't yet have one). Then Oona meets Mikey and Steph meets Ben. Mikey is younger than Oona, a bit Bohemian, his timer set to go off in four months and invites her to go with the flow for a change. For his own reasons, Ben doesn't have a timer, but he likes Steph and it's mutual. In this scientific world, is there room for love - and would anyone know it if it stared them in the face?
