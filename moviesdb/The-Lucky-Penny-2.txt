The Lucky Penny 2

 "The Lucky Penny 2" is a B&W, silent, comedy short. It's filled with slapstick comedy, stunts, and sight gags reminiscent of the Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies from the 1920s. It's a story about a man named 'Luckless' who searches for his lost love. His quest is not an easy one. The Masked Bandits, who he unintentionally caught for the police at one time, have broken out of jail and are eager to settle the score with him. Will he out-smart the Bandits and find his lost love?
