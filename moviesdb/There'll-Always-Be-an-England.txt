There'll Always Be an England

 'There'll Always Be an England' - named after Vera Lynn's stirring intro music - was recorded on Saturday, November 10th and captures the energy and excitement of the band and the crowd. The whole of the classic 'Never Mind The Bollocks' album is performed, together with a mixture Pistols cover versions, b-sides and even an impromptu crowd sing-along of 'I Do Like To Be Beside the Seaside'. This could only ever be the Sex Pistols.
