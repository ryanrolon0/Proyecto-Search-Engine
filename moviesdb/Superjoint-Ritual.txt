Superjoint Ritual

 Pantera lead vocalist Philip Anselmo formed Superjoint Ritual as another vehicle to express his passion for heavy metal at its most brutal, and this home video captures the band onstage in Dallas, Texas on the tour following their album Use Once And Destroy. The band plows through eleven hard and heavy tunes, including "Drug Your Love", "It Takes No Guts", "Everyone Hates Everyone", and "Starvation Trip".
