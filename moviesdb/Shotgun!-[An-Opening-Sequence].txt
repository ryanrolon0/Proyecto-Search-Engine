Shotgun! [An Opening Sequence]

 Your whole life can change in just one day. From just one moment. When Tommy Davenport has a debt to pay to famed king pin Lucio Carvaggio, Tommy's henchmen, Billy, Chubbs and Steve are called in to make the drop off. Sam, Tony and May are enjoying a fancy-free night out on the town. The three average Jo's didn't expect to botch up the drop off, leaving Tommy with little choice but to go after them....or be killed by Lucio in this tale of betrayal, blood lust & a briefcase.
