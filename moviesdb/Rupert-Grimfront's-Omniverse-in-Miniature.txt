Rupert Grimfront's Omniverse in Miniature

 Caesar Campion led an unremarkable, orange-obsessed life until he awoke one morning to find he has been inexplicably replaced by a better version of himself. He's sent on a journey through a world without Reason to find Mr. Incharj, the head of reality itself, to get his life back.
