The Big Bad Swim

 An adult swim class sets the stage for this sexually charged comedy-drama about love, loss, and second chances. Three strangers-inextricably connected through personal heartbreak-find themselves entering deep water as they learn that life isn't always about diving right in-it's about getting your feet wet once in awhile.
