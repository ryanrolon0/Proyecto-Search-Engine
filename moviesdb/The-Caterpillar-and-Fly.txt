The Caterpillar and Fly

 Inspired by William Blake's 'Songs of Innocence and Experience', 'The Caterpillar and Fly' was produced with school pupils based on one of their true stories of an adult's attempt to shield a child's innocence from the realities of the world. In a busy modern home, Oscar, the youngest child of three, is a shy boy who confides in his beloved pet hamster Blaze and the only member of the family who can give him any time, his grandad Stan. One day while Oscar is at school, Stan finds Blaze motionless in his cage. Stan knows Oscar will be heartbroken so conjures up an elaborate plot to protect Oscar from grief. But can we protect childhood innocence forever?
