The Baby Food Dude

 On a planet named Texas, a visionary named Bubba embarked on a 40 day diet of baby food in order to lose weight. Bubba went to California to get his older brother Buddy and bring him back to Texas to see their 87 year old mother and their new baby sister. Buddy convinces Bubba that they needed to get the "Alpha Male Governor" of California to endorse baby food as "The Ultimate Food Source for the Adult Male."
