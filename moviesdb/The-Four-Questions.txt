The Four Questions

 There are many important life questions, but this collection of four stories only answers the following questions Kind of Horse?, Dad - Why You Gotta Be Like That?, and Can I touch your breast? Composed of a cast which are all trained by The Acting Corps in Los Angeles, this is a collage of contemporary relationships and our inability to connect no matter how much we need to.
