Reddy's Redemption

 A dilapidated table, two or three broken chairs, and a tumbled-down bed. To add further to the distempered appearance of the room, the emaciated form of an elderly woman is disclosed gazing expectantly though a half-opened door. She staggers to the bed, upon which she drops from exhaustion. The figure of a roughly dressed young man rushes through the door. He approaches the bed. A look of joy overspreads the face of the poor creature, and Reddy, the crook, is quickly folded in his mother's arms. Kneeling beside her he tells of his futile effort to secure work. It is time to take her medicine and Reddy rises to get it, only to discover that the bottle is empty. Reddy takes up the bottle to get it refilled. Left alone, she examines the parcel and to her amazement, it discloses a dark lantern, black mask and jimmy. The shock is too great. She reels feebly to the bed, on which she falls, just as Reddy is entering the door. He approaches the bed, raises the form of his mother in his arms, kisses her lips, in an effort to revive her. At this juncture a young woman appears upon the scene. Benefited by her timely intercession Reddy resolves to devote his life to reformation. He secures a position through her timely aid, and starts on a life of honest effort. In an evil moment he meets his former associates and again falls into evil ways, through a trap that is made for him. While in the act of forcing the safe, he and his evil companions are surprised by the occupant of the house, who proves to be the charitable young woman who came to his aid when he most needed a friend. A shot is fired by the leader.
