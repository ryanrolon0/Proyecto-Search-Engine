Violent Shit 3 - Infantry of Doom

 3 men get stranded on an island. They are captured by this group of people who turn out to be members of a group under the direction of Karl Sr. and his son Karl Jr., who are the famous butcher/slashers from the first two Violent Shit movies. Soon these three men and a bunch of exiles are given a chance to run away from the group members; unlike some others who are brutally murdered. However they decide to fight back and a gory and violent battle ensues. Karl Jr continues his killing spree on a remote island with the help of his father and their army of metal masked mercenaries known as the Infantry Of Doom. A band of castaways are turned loose in the wilderness and hunted down, where they must fight to survive. They have moon's phase time to make across the island safely.
