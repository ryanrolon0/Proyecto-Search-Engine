Viehjud Levi

 Levi is a Jewish man living alone in a small village in Germany in the mid-1930's. He does a good business buying and selling, he courts the farmer's daughter, and he chats with his pet rabbit during his long road trips. But then there's a cave-in at a nearby railroad tunnel, and this brings the railroad engineer and workers and bureaucrats from Nazi Berlin. Suddenly things get difficult, and not just for Levi.
