Radius

 Radius tells the story of a military ship shot down behind enemy lines. A massive "CraterMaker" warhead has gone active on the downed ship, giving the pilot and her crew 30 minutes to escape the blast. Meanwhile, an entity named Diamone, divided itself into twins to try to stop the bomb and stop the crew.
