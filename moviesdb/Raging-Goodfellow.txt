Raging Goodfellow

 Tommy Goodfellow is the best debt collector in town. That is until his mobster boss announces that the 'family' has been bought out by a big company. Consequently, Tommy's job placed under the category of public relations; he is no longer allowed to use violence or profanity, and his primary concern must be customer safety. As the new restrictions render him ineffective, he decides to become his own boss and beg for money in the streets. Will this be a new beginning for Tommy? Or will corporate oppression follow him everywhere?
