Streets of Flamenco

 A Chicana from East L.A. admired her brother, Alfonso, who was a flamenco dancer. His sudden death becomes the catalyst and inspiration for her to follow her own dream of dancing flamenco. Ignoring all advice; she travels to the birthplace of flamenco, Jerez de la Frontera, in the deepest south of Spain. As an outsider and against all odds, her drive to succeed is challenged, but slowly she enters gypsy flamenco society, ultimately falling in love with the gypsy flamenco/rock singer. By following her dream Maria not only finds love, but also discovers what it means to live her life in flamenco by freeing her deepest passions for the dance, the art and life itself.
