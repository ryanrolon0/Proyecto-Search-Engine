Profile

 A woman is profiled by an airport detection device. Found to be a threat, she has only seconds in which to come up with a strategy to reverse the machine's decision. This disquieting socio-political allegory is centered around the technology adopted by 21st century Western culture desperate to control and to contain. A film for the thoughtful mind.
