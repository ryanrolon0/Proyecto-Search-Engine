Reve-enka

 Based on a Norwegian folk tale, with the addition of a second tale and a scene from a third. - The basic story Reve-enka (literally "the fox widow"), sits alone in her empty house with only her trusty feline maid Korse for company. Three suitors - the Bear, the Wolf and a young Fox - come to her door. There is no prize for guessing who wins her favour. The story is told in typical fairy tale style, with repetitions and characters speaking partly in rhyme. (There is also a live action opening and ending claiming to show how story collector Asbjørnsen discovered the original tale and recorded it for posterity.)
