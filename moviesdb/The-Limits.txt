The Limits

 Sanjeet is an Electrical Engineer from Bombay, who immigrated to the United States of America with his wife, Satia. They had a young son, Vishi, who passed away years ago. Unable to get employment, Sanjeet now operates a motel and charges about $45/day. He often refuses customers who maybe unable to pay or create problems. He accordingly refuses to permit Tyrel for a room for a night, but Satia intervenes - and he not only permits but also hires him, - and lets him live amongst his other tenants, which include a suicidal author; a abused wife hunted by her angry spouse - leading to a chain of events that will alter their lives forever.
