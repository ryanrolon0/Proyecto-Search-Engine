Sunset in El Dorado

 The story involves a rather odd flashback by Dale who is visiting El Dorado, home of her grandmother. She dreams about her grandmother's adventures including a romance with a cowboy who looks very much like Roy. Roy, of course, also exists in the present for Dale. Songs include "Go West, Young Man," "Lady Who Wouldn't Say Yes," and "Belle of the El Dorado." Lucille Wiley tires of her job with a bus company and suddenly departs for places unknown, much to the surprise of her fiancEe Cecil Phelps and her Aunt Dolly, who take off in hot pursuit. They catch up with her, but she pulls some dirty work on the car and they are stranded in the desert near the ghost town of El Dorado. They split up to search for help and Lucille runs into singing cowboy Roy Rogers and persuades him to tow the car into El Dorado. In the ruins of the Golden Nugget gambling house, she meets an old prospector, Gabby Whittaker, who immediately notices her striking resemblance to a portrait of Kansas Kate Wiley, queen of the old Golden Nugget. She tells Gabby that Kansas Kate was her grandmother and Gabby leaves her to fall asleep in Kate's room. Dreaming, she is carried back to the roaring boomtown of El Dorado in its heyday... where Cyril Earle, owner of the Golden Nugget, is in love with Kansas Kate, his star entertainer. When Kate's friend Gabby makes a gold strike, she stakes him so that he can file his claim. Cyril and his henchman Buster Welch try to get Gabby's claim, but cowboy Roy Rogers (dual role) comes to the rescue, cleaning up the syndicate of thieves in El Dorado, and Kate falls in love with Roy.
