Shitamachi

 A young Japanese woman, widowed in the Second World War, has her young son to raise but can find nothing else to live for. Grief for her lost husband and her diminished circumstances nearly overwhelms her. When a plain-spoken workman comes to work for her, she finds new meaning in life and a strength that enables her to withstand new tragedies.
