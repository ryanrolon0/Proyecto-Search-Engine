Saddlebags

 SADDLEBAGS, pits four unlikely female heroes against an evil, double-crossing Sheriff, a hapless snake oil salesman and the odd homosexual Bavarian pacifist. After a freak mining accident in their 1890s Northwestern town kills all the men, an unlikely quartet - Mrs. Cranston, the hard nosed Scottish shopkeeper; Humility, a sexually repressed religious zealot; Mary, the worst whore in the west; and Jane, a fragile English rose - band together to start a new life...or die trying. Life in 1896 is no picnic, especially if you don't wear the chaps in the family. So when a freak mining accident blows up their town, four feisty women grab the cash and hightail it into the big, bad, wild, Northwest with an evil Sheriff hot on their trail. Fast paced and outrageous, SADDLEBAGS, brings together an unlikely quartet as they gallop down a dusty road to start a new life...or die trying. Along the way, Mrs. Cranston (the hard-nosed shopkeeper), Humility (a sexually repressed zealot), Mary (the worst whore in the west), and Jane (a fragile English rose), face-off against a gang of morons, a seriously sexy snake oil salesman, and a town of gay Bavarian pacifists.
