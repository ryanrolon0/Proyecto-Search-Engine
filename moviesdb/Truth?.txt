Truth?

 A post-modern movie musical told in 30 fragments, or 'Frags', which can be watched individually or as a whole. Using a technique called 'popfictionlife', the story is a mixture of fictional construction and reality. Alex is a frustrated young musician who creates a character named 'Truth?' who puts out video-blog 'manifestos' ranting against the state of the music business. He hides his true identity behind a mask of digital effects and spreads these visual manifestos virally on the web as a desperate call to find a pure musical collaborator. A beautiful but unstable young poet, Pearl, blogs back, and they become a famous song-writing team on the web without ever meeting each other. As Pearl searches for Truth?'s true identity, fate takes a hand, leaving no one untouched by the whirlwind of music, passion, sex, fame and delusion.
