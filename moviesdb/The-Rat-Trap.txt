The Rat Trap

 Martin Cranfield is a pompous, self centered, gluttonous individual who is excessively proud of his position as the Chief Financial Officer of The Greater Hamlin Regional Council. His PA and assistant, Sylvia and Miranda do not meet his expectations and are treated accordingly. They in turn view Martin with derision and certainly don't share his enthusiasm for their workplace, preferring to gossip around the water cooler or talk about hair styles. This morning he has a visitor carrying a flute, seeking a sizable payment for some pest control work but without the required paperwork. Refusing to be flippantly dismissed by Martin the visitor assesses his weaknesses quickly and introduces a level of chaos into his morning he cannot cope with.
