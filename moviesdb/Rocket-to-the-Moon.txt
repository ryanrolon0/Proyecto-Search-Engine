Rocket to the Moon

 In 1938 New York, a dentist finds his business failing and his marriage on the rocks. Turning 40, he is a hen-pecked husband with little drive left for success. That is, until he starts getting involved with his lively assistant, a free spirit with a penchant for tall tales and a hidden loneliness. Receiving encouragement from his own father-in-law, the two find comfort in each other's attention.
