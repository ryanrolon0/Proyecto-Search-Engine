Quality Time

 The film follows Simon, an absent father, during the day of the week he spends with his two children George and Evelyn. Their day is packed full of hasty activities and a picturesque trip to the beach that, due to the anticipation of the day, provoke a shared and occasionally demented excitement that is inevitably quick to burn. The film presents the tension between Simon's desire to experience a memorable family day together, his anxiety of disappearing time and George and Evelyn's fading energy levels. His experience of fatherhood so far seems that of a host, leading a weekly event in his children's lives.
