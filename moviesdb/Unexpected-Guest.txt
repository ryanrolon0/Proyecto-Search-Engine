Unexpected Guest

 At the reading of his late cousin's will, California learns the estate will be divied among whoever remains of the seven relatives. With one already dead, another immediately murdered, and the Lawyer telling them the ranch is almost worthless, Hoppy investigates. Finding the ranch valuable and the Lawyer embezzling money from it, Hoppy confronts him. California has inherited a ranch along with five other relatives. But the will has a proviso that, should any of the heirs die, the portions are redistributed among the survivors. Of course someone dies. Hoppy manages to keep it to a couple of deaths.
