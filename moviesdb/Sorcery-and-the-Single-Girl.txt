Sorcery and the Single Girl

 Those TV witches have got it made.... Wiggle a nose. Dinner's on the table! Hop on a broom. Next stop, Tahiti! Unfortunately, nose-wiggling doesn't cut it in real life. So witch or not, Jane Madison must deal with her insane work schedule, best-friend drama and romantic dry spell like everyone else. But now the exclusive Washington Coven wants Jane to join. This could be a dream come true for the magical misfit, or it could be the most humiliating experience of her life. Either way, the crap's gonna hit the cauldron because Jane is about to be tested in ways she's never imagined - and, pass or fail, nothing will ever be the same.
