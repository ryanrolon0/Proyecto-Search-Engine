Shelomo Selinger - MEmoire de Pierre

 A portrait of Shelomo Selinger, sculptor living in Paris. He was reborn at age 17, with amnesia and without a past. Since the War he has built a full and vital existence. Each morning he hurries out to his studio to begin hammering stone or wood. Like a metronome the sound echoes throughout his atelier's courtyard, sometimes accompanied by his neighbor the pianist. In this film we follow Shelomo in his daily life. He reveals his past, the depth of his relationship with the materials he works with and his commitment to life. With help from his friends and family, we see a portrait of this force of nature, determined, touching, overflowing with light, ferociously celebrating life.
