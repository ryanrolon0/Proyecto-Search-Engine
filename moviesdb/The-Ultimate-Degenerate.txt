The Ultimate Degenerate

 Maria is in the city, bored with her lover Tammy. An exhibitionist, she answers an ad in the "New York Review of Sex." She's invited to a house in Vermont, owned by an eccentric named Spencer, a man who likes to watch. Maria goes, seeking thrills. She meets women who spend their days rehearsing for shows staged for Spencer. He has a concoction of aphrodisiacs, and the women are happy to take the drugs and play - with each other, for the camera, in front of Spencer, and with Boris, Spencer's assistant who runs the household. Maria throws herself into the games. Which person will prove to be the ultimate degenerate?
