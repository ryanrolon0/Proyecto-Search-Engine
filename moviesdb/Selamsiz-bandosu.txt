Selamsiz bandosu

 Selamsiz (wich means 'no greeting') is a small town in Anatolia. The town has a lot of problems but noone from governments come and see the town. One day the mayor learns that the prime minister will come to the city. They, now, have a chance to solve their problems. However, they think that they should have a band to greet the prime minister. As Latif, the mayor of Selamsiz, reads about the President's trip to the region. He learns that the Prsident will pass by train from their village. In order to welcome the President decently, he decides to set up a band for the village. One day a man called Murat comes to the village. He is known as the "Chief". The "Chief" helps the mayor with the band business. They choose all the musicians amongst the villagers. However most of them has never seen a music instrument in their life. They work and work but they are not close to being perfect. The Mayor hopes that the band will attract the President's attention and he will visit the village. The big day comes, the band gets ready to play. But the result is disastrous, as the train comes... passes by and leave.. The only thing training to the villagers is the image of a hand slowly waving at them.
