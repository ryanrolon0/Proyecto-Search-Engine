The Homemaker

 Richa is managing the house, while her mom's away, and the maid's on leave! She is putting up with her totally bratty brother and her busy father. She wants a reward for everything that she is going through and puts forward a bill to her mother. But can one put a price tag on everything that one does? Will Richa realise, who the real "Homemaker", is?
