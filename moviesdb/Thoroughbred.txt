Thoroughbred

 Thoroughbred takes you inside the world of big-time horse racing. Visit the backside, the breeding shed, the auction ring and the winner's circle on Kentucky Derby Day. Meet the owners and trainers, the jockeys and grooms, the breeders and bloodstock agents. It's a world built on money and competition, passion and tradition, knowledge and luck. And built, most of all, on dreams.
