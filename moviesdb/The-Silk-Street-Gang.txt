The Silk Street Gang

 Nine-year-old Christopher lives in downtown Allentown, PA in 1993. Part of an all-black, teenage neighborhood basketball team called "The Silk Street Gang", Christopher dreams of becoming like his idol, Michael Jordan, despite the fact that he sucks at basketball. His teammates, however, have other plans for him.
