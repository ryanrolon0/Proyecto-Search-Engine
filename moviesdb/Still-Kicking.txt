Still Kicking

 "Woke up one morning. Age was on my mind." Amy Gorman and Frances Kandl journey throughout the San Francisco Bay Area searching for female role models-very old women, still active artists, living with zest. While Amy chronicles their oral histories, Frances is inspired to compose songs for several of the women, culminating in concerts honoring their lives. Painter, rug braider, pianist, dancer, sculptor, ikebana artist; the film gently reveals each abundant and vital life. They lead us to the realization that we all can uncover and act upon our own inner passions and follow them with heart and soul. Well into our old age we can wake up each morning and live fully in the here and now, just like the women in Still Kicking.
