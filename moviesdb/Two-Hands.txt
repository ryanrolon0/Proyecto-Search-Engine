Two Hands

 In 1964, Leon Fleisher's career as a concert pianist was thriving. A seemingly minor accident - a cut on his right thumb - led to dystonia, the involuntary curling of his right hand's ring and little fingers. In recent interviews, Fleisher talks about what followed despair and disappointments, surgery in 1983 that led to a brief return to the concert hall, and, finally, with Botox and Rolfing, the ability to play with two hands. In between, Fleisher discovers his ecstasies teaching, and playing compositions for one hand commissioned in the early twentieth century for a World War I veteran.
