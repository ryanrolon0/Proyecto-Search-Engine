Retrato Falado de uma Mulher Sem Pudor

 The model Paula Marcondes is drowned in her bathtub. The police do not find any evidence that the criminal has broken in the apartment; therefore they assume that the killer would be an acquaintance of the victim. They find an agenda, with names of powerful and influential persons, and chief of police Dirceu NEllis assigns Detective Silvio Almeida to investigate the murder case. Silvio finds the name of the scum Johnny Gravatinha and Juca, the singer, in the agenda and he begins his investigation visiting Gravatinha in his office. The crook is with his mistress Jandira and tells details of his relationship with Paula, but he does not give much attention to the detective. Then he arrests Juca and the violent detective Lucas gets his confession by the use of torture. Then, Silvio meets the flight attendant Priscilla; Paula's ex-husband Leopoldo Bergson; the banker and Paula's ex-fiancE JosE Roldão; Abdel Azis Camel; Cacá Salles; and Marcos Arruda. Each man describes how he had met Paula and shagged her. Detective Silvio Almeida analyses the investigation and discloses the identity of the killer and his motives
