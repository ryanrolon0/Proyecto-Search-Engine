Villain and Widow

 Struggling to support herself and teenage daughter, widow Yeon-ju rents out the second floor of her home to Chang-In, who claims to be a novelist working on a new book. The neighbors suspect Chang-In's true identity, as he spends an inordinate time in Yeon-ju's quarters whenever he's left home alone. A battle of wits, charm and various tensions ensue with the trio living under one roof, each harboring their own elaborate motives.
