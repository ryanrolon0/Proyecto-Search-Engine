So You Want to Be a Gambler

 Meet Joe McDoakes, an inveterate gambler and, as a result, flat broke. He cons a newsboy out of a nickel and uses that to win $50 on a drug store pinball machine. He takes his winnings to a gambling hall where he lets a fast-talking friend lead him astray. With almost all of his $50 gone, he makes a final stop at the roulette wheel, where a talking bird gives him advice. Will Joe ever know when to quit?
