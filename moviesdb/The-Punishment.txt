The Punishment

 A man wakes up in a strange place with an unusual concept of space and time and begins to get haunted by a woman's scream. He tries to run away from the scream but is unable to do so. Meanwhile, a man without a face, holding a whip in his hand, who is somehow related to these events, is introduced.
