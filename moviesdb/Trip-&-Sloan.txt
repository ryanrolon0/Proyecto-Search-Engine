Trip & Sloan

 The film opens with two friends, Trip and Sloan, driving around Santa Monica talking about the definitive '80s song. Sloan believes it to be The Soviet National Anthem as the song was so culturally prevalent in the 1980s, but hasn't been heard in the U.S. much since. Soon after, the two nearly run into Trip's ex-girlfriend. Trip wants to pass her without having to talk to her, but he'd still like to be seen by her so that she'll conjure up memories of their good times. Trip and Sloan come up with a convoluted plan to accomplish the mission.
