Sehnsucht nach der unbekannten Heimat

 My mother is a Muslim educated Turk who comes in the 60th as a "foreign worker" to Germany. I have grown up in a small village in the North-Hessian-Germany which meets all stranger with suspicion. The film-maker Olaf Saumer, pupil of the art college of Kassel, looks at the German Turkish past and present of his own family - and at the " second half " of his Ichs which longs into strange language, the voiceless and anonymous relatives and the foreign land like for the lost paradise.
