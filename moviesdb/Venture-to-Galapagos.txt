Venture to Galapagos

 The movie documents a voyage of personal discovery aboard a private motor vessel from Costa Rica to the magical Galapagos Islands. We stop at the isolated Cocos Island en route and we experience the differing character of each of the islands in the Galapagos as well as encounter the wild life for which the archipelago is justly famous.
