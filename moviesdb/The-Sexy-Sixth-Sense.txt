The Sexy Sixth Sense

 Frances is a lonely young man cursed with the ability to experience beyond the five senses. But that curse turns to a blessing when he begins to see the spirits of sexy, succulent, uninhibited lesbians engage in erotic games of pleasure that seem all too real. These lesbians had been go-go dancers when they were of this world, so they know how to grind their luscious bodies against one another in the most amazing ways. They also remember what it means to be alive, and to indulge every female fantasy and satisfy each inconceivable urge that swells as eager mouths prepare to meet. As these acts of ghostly eroticism intensify, Frances must turn to a beautiful psychiatrist for help. She, too, has a body to die for - but much more than mental health on her mind.
