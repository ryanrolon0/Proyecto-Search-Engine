Staged

 Staged is the ultimate backstage pass, a one -hour documentary into the creative chaos of concert staging - with commentary and sizzling concert footage from the Rolling Stones, U2, Pink Floyd and David Bowie and a galaxy of others. Staged loks behind the growing alienation between artist and audience to paint a remarkable picture of rock-and-roll's future.
