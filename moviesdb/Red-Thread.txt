 Billy works as a maintenance guy in a luxury apartment complex. Tamara, a new tenant, is engaged to Mark and is about to become a trophy wife.

One night, right after her fiancE has gone on a business trip, Tamara gets injured. There is no one to help her except the maintenance guy. Tamara and Billy unexpectedly discover a friendship that could lead them both to realizing the dreams they'd nearly given up on, if only Tamara weren't engaged and Miss Johnson weren't watching.
