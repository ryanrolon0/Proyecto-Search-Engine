The Wilderness Road

 During the 18th c., an irresistible human tide swept against the western mountains of Virginia, anxious to spill beyond these natural barriers, into a vast and dangerous wilderness to the west. Here, dreams could be fulfilled by those courageous enough to take on the monumental risks. The passageway to this "promised land" was an old buffalo trace known as the Wilderness Road. This is the story about the collision course of cultures. One man who helped shape this era of the American Revolution, was Joseph Martin. A companion of Daniel Boone, Martin established one of the earliest wilderness outposts in Powell's Valley, that would serve as a refuge against the harsh realities of the frontier.
