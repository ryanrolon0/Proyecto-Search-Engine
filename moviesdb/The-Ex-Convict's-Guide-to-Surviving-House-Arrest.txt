The Ex-Convict's Guide to Surviving House Arrest

 When car-jacking, inmate-murdering, bad-ass criminal Robin Sutherland, sits down for his parole hearing, he has no idea that he will be granted his greatest wish, and his worst nightmare.

Chuck hates Robin, Robin hates Chuck, Shirley hates Robin, Robin hates Shirley, but Chuck loves Shirley, and will do anything for her.
