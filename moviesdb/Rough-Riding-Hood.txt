Rough Riding Hood

 Woody is reading the tale of Little Red Riding Hood... and soon finds himself living the fable when a sobbing Red confronts him, telling him how a mean wolf has been bullying her on her entire trip to Grandma's. Woody plans to get even with the fiendish (and totally stupid) wolf by swapping places with her and going to HIS Grandma's. The wolf stops Woody carrying an apple pie and demands, "Let me have it" (Needless to say, he gets it alright!). Woody then offers the wolf a plum pudding (actually a beehive). The wolf takes a "shortcut" to get to Granny's first but Woody is on to his scheme leading him into several nasty spots (a water geyser, an eagle's nest, and a phone booth which blasts into orbit like a rocket). Woody arrives at Granny's and takes Granny's place finally getting rid of the wolf at last. Alas, when he tells Granny they're rid of that wolf, she angrily tells him, "For thirty years, I've been trying to MARRY that wolf" and gives the woodpecker a good spanking!
