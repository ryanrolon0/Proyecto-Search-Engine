The Blood in This Town

 In the thick of America's economic crisis, the hard-hit town of Rutland, Vermont isn't waiting for a bail-out. Once a boomtown built on railroads, quarries and manufacturing, Rutland, Vermont is a blue-collar town that's been written-off and forgotten, like thousands of struggling small towns across America. Yet Rutland is also the town that could provide a blueprint to revive America. When Rutlanders learned that one pint of blood can save up to three lives, they rolled up their sleeves and broke all blood-donation records. When they realized that no one was coming to save them, they decided to do it for themselves. THE BLOOD IN THIS TOWN chronicles Rutland's drive to revitalize, from developing world-class natural recreation, farm-to-table networks, entrepreneurial start-ups, and the revival of a historic downtown -- all fueled by citizens who've put aside their differences for the good of the town.
