The Gwen Stefani Grand Burial Exhibition

 A futuristic commercial for a History channel-type show featuring artifacts from the supposed Mortuary Temple of Gwen Stefani, the well-known singer and designer from the 21st century. Her reign of the Pop Empire during the period known as 'The Tragic Kingdom' is documented as if it were still culturally significant a thousand years later. Key stop-motion animations shots include submersion of the Hollywood Hills due to global warming and preparation of artifacts for installation at the Museum of Historical Makeovers.
