Red Fork Range

 It's time for the stagecoach race to win the mail contract and the only entries are Reden and Farrell. Reden's men kidnap Farrell's daughter and then force him to withdraw. Wally rescues Ruth, buys out Farrel, and enters the race himself. But Reden has his men planted along the course to make sure Wally doesn't win. "Whip" Rowden(Bud Osborne),owner of the Frontier Express Company, has found Black Bart(Al Ferguson) and his men valuable aids in conducting the dirty work for his company.Bart has secured the help of Chief Barking Fox(Chief John Big Tree) and his tribe to enable Rowden to secure a government contract---to go to the company with the fastest coach in a race ran between Hangtown and Placerville.Wally Hamilton(Wally Wales)learns of a plan to attack an incoming wagon train on which his sweetheart, Ruth Farrell(Ruth Mix)is traveling. She is the daughter of Wally's employer,Charles Farrell(Lafe McKee),the owner of the Golden West Express Company,and Rowden's rival for the government contract.(She is also on a wagon train led by a man called The Colonel,wearing a Bufflao Bill-like beard and goatee who is also played, in a 2nd role in the film for him,by Lafe McKee.The odds are high,this was the pre-S.A.G.days, that McKee was there on a day-player's basis and could have been asked to play a 3rd role, if needed, at the same price.)The train is attacked and is saved by Wally and the soldiers but not before Ruth is abducted. The ranson demand is that Farrell withdraw from the contract competition.Wally trails the messenger to the gang's hideout, rescues Ruth and then drives the winning stagecoach in the race.
