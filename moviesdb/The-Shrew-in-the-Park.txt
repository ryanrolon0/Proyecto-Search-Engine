The Shrew in the Park

 A cinematic retelling of William Shakespeare's classic farce, The Shrew in the Park follows a community theatre group staging "The Taming of the Shrew" as a Shakespeare in the Park production. We see the backstage drama, the long hours of preparation, the crappy jobs, as the actors make sacrifices to do what they love best entire text of the play is the movie's only dialogue.
