The Witch's Cat

 A witch and her really-stupid cat try to disrupt a Hallowe'en celebration by the mice. They swoop down on the mice as they are parading around a bonfire. But the cat burns its tail, is discovered, and the Mighty One is summoned. He ties the cat in knots and the celebration continues.
