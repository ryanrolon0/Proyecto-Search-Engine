The Tragedy of Maria Macabre

 "The Tragedy of Maria Macabre" is a carnival of horrors that begins at the end of the life of our twisted heroine, Miss Macabre. Arriving in the land of the dead, Maria Macabre is greeted by their King, Queen, and a Court of various, ghoulish Hades-Dwellers including a maniacal Ringmistress, an immolated Beauty Queen, a menacing French Clown, and three skeletal Mariachis. In the spirit of Powell & Pressburger, the early 19th century European Circus, and El Dia de los Muertos, "The Tragedy of Maria Macabre" follows rich traditions of visual storytelling including dance, circus, clown, mime, physical theater, stylized lighting, and human-marionettes. As Maria's transition progresses, each resident of the Land of the Dead is reminded of a moment from their once-lives- or of the very moment of their own death. The Beauty Queen's tragic tale of death by fire, and the Clown's electro-shock treatment gone wrong are two of the stories that unfold within Maria Macabre's saga. The stage production of "The Tragedy of Maria Macabre" performed in New York at the legendary experimental theater house La MaMa E.T.C, avant-garde dance house The Kitchen, and at several other theater, dance, and art gallery spaces in NYC.
