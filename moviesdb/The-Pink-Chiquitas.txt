The Pink Chiquitas

 Hotshot private detective Tony Mareda Jr. arrives in the town of Beamsville being pursued by the hit men of mob boss Don Enchilada. As he dispatches them at the local drive through, a pink meteor roars overhead and crashes in the nearby woods. The townspeople tear off in pursuit, but as the young couples thrash through the woods in search of the rock the women are turned into ravenous nymphomaniacs. Next morning, their boyfriends are found in delirious shock and there is an empty crater where the meteor landed. Worried about what the event will do to his reelection bid, the mayor enlists Tony's help in solving the mystery. As he begins to investigate, however, local TV weatherman Clip Bacardi goes on the air with a chunk of the meteorite he found in the woods, and the sound of it transforms all of the women in town into scantily-clad vixens. A posse hunting for the meteor encounters Clip's girlfriend Mary Ann Kowalski, the local librarian who is now organizing a takeover of the town. After subduing her, Tony and Cliff go back into the woods and find the meteor in a cave, where the women come to worship it. With the remaining men in town reduced to stupefied zombies, Tony and Cliff are captured and Tony offered as a sacrifice to the meteor. As the meteor draws Tony to it, however, its powers cause the cave wall to break apart and wash it into the town lake, destroying it and returning the women to normal.
