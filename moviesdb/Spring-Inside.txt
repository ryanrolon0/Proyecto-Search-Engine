Spring Inside

 Mrs. Standish may be old, but her heart is not! As she's enjoying the company of a plumber who's come to fix her sink, she falls asleep. A young girl comes in and flirts with the plumber and extracts a kiss before leaving. After the plumbing job is finished, the plumber leaves the home and sees a picture of the young girl. He discovers that it is a picture of Mrs. Standish as a young woman.
