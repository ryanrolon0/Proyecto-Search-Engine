Share the Wealth

 Share the Wealth situates a homeless Native American woman on a busy city street. Thanks to the new "homeless tax" incurred by the government, she must raise the dollar she now owes. The film creates an absurd, highly stylized environment where nothing is out of the ordinary and sets one woman's personal transformation against the backdrop of everyday chaos and uncertainty.
