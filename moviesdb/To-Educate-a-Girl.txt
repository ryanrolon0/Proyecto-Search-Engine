To Educate a Girl

 What does it take to educate a girl in a world where 72 million children are not in school -two thirds of them female? Award-Winning Filmmakers Frederick Rendina and Oren Rudavsky set out to find the answer, traveling to two countries emerging from conflict and struggling with poverty, Nepal and Uganda. Framed by the United Nations global initiative to provide equal access to education for girls by 2015, the film takes a ground-up view of that effort through the eyes of girls out of school, starting school or fighting against the odds to stay in school.To Educate a Girl is a compelling look at the lives of young women who are striving to get an education in the face of conflict, poverty and gender bias.
