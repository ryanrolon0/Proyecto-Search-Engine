Smoky River Serenade

 Developer J. Bricket Armstrong is out to buy up all the land in Hondo Valley. but rancher "Pop" Robinson won't sell his because of a promise he made his son, killed in WWII, and he also is housing a stranded band of show-business troupers. But, foreclosure is on the horizon, but the troupers put on a Big Show, and rodeo-performer Jack Norman kicks in his winnings from the Smoky River Rodeo to save the old Homestead. The ramshackle Smoky River Ranch is all that stands in the way of a developer and a big real-estate deal, but the old man who owns the ranch won't sell it, because he has to take care of some down-and-out theater people to honor his dead son's memory. Frustrated, the developer sends in a pretty young girl to try to trick the old man into selling the ranch.
