Victoria's Shadow

 Victoria is bitten by a vampire, who is also the trusted town doctor at her friend's funeral. Her husband Jacob impales her with his walking stick and entombs her in the family mausoleum. 120 years later, her slumber is disturbed by two hoodlums (one of them being the reincarnation of her husband Jacob) who steal her jewels to pay off their major gambling debts. She soon awakens from her slumber and with the help of Dr. Ayer's (the vampire who sired her) go on a murderous rampage throughout the town.
