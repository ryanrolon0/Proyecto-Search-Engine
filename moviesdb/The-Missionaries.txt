The Missionaries

 The Missionaries follows three Mormon Missionaries that have been abandoned by their Elder, Peter and now find themselves lost and wandering the desert of Mexico. Tobias is now left in charge as he tries to keep spirits high between the pessimist Mike and the overly devout Ali. Trying to reach the border town of Laredo, conditions worsen as water and food begin to run out. When all hope to find civilization seems impossible, the three find a new found meaning to their mission and soon find themselves helping others in a way that they never imagined.
