The Wishing Well

 A simple wish for love goes awry in this pop-up book story come-to-life. But that is only half the story. The Wishing Well is an experimental one-man production. It is a celebration of filmmaking, and a demonstration of what can be accomplished from within a home studio, by just one person. The Wishing Well is a combination of live action and 3D animation.
