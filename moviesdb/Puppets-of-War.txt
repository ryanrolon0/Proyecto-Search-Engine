Puppets of War

 The setting is a small trench on the front line of a looming battle. Awaiting the culmination, one young soldier experiences, first hand, the distress of the first Great War. Over several days, this soldier suffers loss of hearing, loss of companions, and finally loss of self. Reality becomes infected as the harsh environment takes a toll on the soldiers.
