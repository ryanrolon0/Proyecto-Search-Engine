Remi

 Remi is an illegal immigrant scraping a living and sleeping rough in a cold northern city far from his home. He has retained his dignity though, turning down work he considers questionable, even when suggested by likable young fellow-immigrant Inzo. When Remi learns that there have been floods in his homeland he is frantic to contact the young daughter he had to leave behind. He uses the little cash he has made posting fliers for a kebab shop to buy a phone card and contact his best friend back home, Lito. Almost overwhelmed with emotion, Remi learns that his daughter is safe but he is now desperate to get home and will consider anything to make the money he needs. Turned down for work by the local 'ganger' because of his height, Inzo unexpectedly comes to his rescue.
