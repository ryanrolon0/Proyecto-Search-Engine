Roaring Ranch

 Geoligist Kane is after Jim Dailey's ranch for the oil he knows is there. When Jim refuses the offer of Kane and his phony Count Reginald, they burn down Jim's buildings. Jim finds two men nearby, both with halves of $100 dollar bills and guesses where he can find the missing halves. Jim Dailey, the owner of a run-down ranch, loves June Marlin, who is also being courted by Ramsey Kane, a geologist. Kane discovers oil on Jim's ranch, and plots to buy the property at a low price. Jim refuses to sell, and Kane enlists the aid of a fake Russian Count, Reginald Sobuski. Kane has his henchmen burn down Jim's ranch-house. Jim rescues the two children that he has been caring for from the fire, and then goes after the culprits. Plot used in 1935 as the basis for "Heir to Trouble."
