The Harsh Life of Veronica Lambert

 Desire and addiction form the confluence of bad choices and unintended consequences for Veronica Lambert. Her desperation to see her desires fulfilled is palpable as she acclimatizes to big city life, while assuaged by the good intentions of Mr. New York, an old-time movie hustler who befriends the new arrival to the Hollywood scene. Her interest in true love and naivete in life becomes fodder for her married lover, who ultimately seduces her into a criminally-sociopathic and brutal act. Similar to Crash or Pulp Fiction, each character's progressively egocentric motives juxtapose one another, form a cross-hatch of competing elements to complicate and in the end, clarify the outcome of a long path toward betrayal and loss. Veronica's harsh life in Hollywood starts in a small town with a desire for love and attraction in the big city, when fuelled by competing passions, destiny rapidly leads to a turnstile of disingenuous friends and drugs, overshadowed by the sexual and narcissistic desires of her best friend Maya. Ultimately, her journey for true love takes a multi-faceted detour at the effect of other's decisions, with life-changing consequences for her and those for whom she cares the most.
