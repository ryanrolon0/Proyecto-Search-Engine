The Flower

 The Flower contrasts a Utopian society that freely farms and consumes a pleasure giving flower with a society where the same flower is illegal and its consumption is prohibited. The animation is a meditation on the social and economic costs of drug prohibition. It also contrasts legal and illegal drug economies.
