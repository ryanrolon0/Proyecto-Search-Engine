The Dream Play

 Mark is a new actor in town rehearsing for 'The Dream Play' by August Strindberg at a local theater. While trying to master the multiple roles he was cast to play, he recollects a day from his past when a chance encounter with a hitchhiker changed the course of his life and his identity. Struggling to make ends meet, he answers an ad placed on the theater's message board by a mysterious young woman, which leads him to participate in a private play that will alter his perspective on acting, theater and his own life.
