Rising Panorama of a Norwegian Waterfall

 Shows a fine view of the celebrated Seven Sisters Waterfalls. It was taken in an unusual way. It opens on the turbulent water at the foot, and gradually rises so as to show from the bottom to the top of the mountain, a height of 800 feet, including the channels from whence start the Seven Falls, which have become one of the sights of Norway.
