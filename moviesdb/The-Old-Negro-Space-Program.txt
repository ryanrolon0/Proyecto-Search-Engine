The Old Negro Space Program

 In 1957, African-American astronauts found themselves unable to break the color barrier at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Undaunted, and on a shoestring budget, they formed their own space program, the "Negro-American Space Society of Astronauts" (NASSA). Told in documentary style satirizing Ken Burns' documentary "The Civil War," this comedic short traces NASSA's rise and fall with a nod to the true history of the Negro Baseball Leagues.
