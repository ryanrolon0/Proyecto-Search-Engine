Score!

 REva Joy, at 23, has given up boys for bowling. The only score this cute, Asian, Silver Lake hipster wants is a perfect 300. Her friends, however, aim to convert REva back into the dating kind. Loanne knows the where and how of it, Susan knows who might be good for it, and Kelly just wants to do it with anyone who can finish what he starts! Happily, REva meets Jeremy...and his stalking ex-girlfriend. In an estrogen-filled bowl-off, REva fights for the perfect game and the perfect man.
