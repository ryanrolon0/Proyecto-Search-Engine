The Sacred and the Absurd

 The last day in the life of Sadegh Hedayat, an Iranian writer in Paris, who committed suicide in 1951. Projected on three screens that resemble the walls of a room, and also the parallel narratives of Hedayat's mind, the film recounts through imagery Hedayat's last day and night.
