Shades of Colour

 With timeless themes of alienation, hope, social pressures and what it really 'means' to 'come of age'- Shades of Colour portrays a young woman struggling to accept this 'real' world without losing her natural self in the process. Emotionally torn between the serene, rural, seaside have of her youth and the jarring realities of life in the bog city, Shades of Colour is a meditative experience more common in our own lives then most of us may even realize.
