Staremaster

 Animal Collective, Gang Gang Dance, 1/3 Rings, 2/3 Growing and Black Dice A/V competing in a staring contest. Staremaster magnifies the playground past-time of staring contests to gloriously absurd proportions. With a deadpan sense of seriousness and purpose, STAREMASTER Gang Gang Dance vs Growing and Friends delivers a simple portrait of a group of friends playing a simple game. The format of the film also presents a playful 'reflection' on the experience of cinema for the audience. Seamlessly blending the aesthetics of Andy Warhol, John Cage, Merv Griffin and Guy Debord with pop references and a minimalist aesthetic -- but without resorting to heavy-handed polemics -- the film calls into question the increasingly arbitrary distinction between spectators and the spectacle.
