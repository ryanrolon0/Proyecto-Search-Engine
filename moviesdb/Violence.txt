Violence

 Undersover magazine reporter Ann Mason is able to infiltrate a neo-facist organization that recruits disgruntled war veterans with a paranoiac populist message that views both labor and management as enemies. She becomes secretary to the organization's leader, True Dawson, a smooth-talking scam artist who uses the member's dues and the organization's manpower for his own nefarious ends. Fred Stalk, one of Dawson's enforcers, suspects her motives but lack of evidence and his attraction to her keeps him from acting against her. While en route to break her expose, Ann's taxi is pursued by government agent Steve Fuller, and the resultant crash leaves her with a concussion and loss of memory. Fuller uses the opportunity to convince her that he's her fiancE and gains access to the racketeers. Magazine writer Ann Mason infiltrates the United Defenders, a public service organization which is actually a front for racketeers. But a case of amnesia threatens to blow her cover.
