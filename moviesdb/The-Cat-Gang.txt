The Cat Gang

 The Cat Gang are a group of English children who like to hang around the local harbour even though the Customs Officers wish they'd go away. Then one day the gang spots somebody behaving very suspiciously and discover a gang of smugglers. Watch out for a very young 'Francesca Annis' (qv) in her first screen role.
