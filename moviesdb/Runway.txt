Runway

 Eve, Alexa, Chloe, and Gina, four "runway girls" hoping for stardom as super models, are the property of Helena, a heartless fashion designer who knows of their sordid pasts. Helena uses the girls as stepping stones to her own success, and is planning a private showing to be attended by four V.I.P. guests, fashion world mover and shakers Sergio, Christian, Hans, and Calvin. Three of the men are there to exploit Helena's girls. One, however, is looking for a fresh face, and body, to wear only a scent Sin," a new fragrance he will soon be marketing. One of Helena's Runway Girl may soon be free from her clutches - but which?
