The Exploits of the Emden

 A German officer requests for his wife to join him on the German battleship SMS Emden, then patrolling seas in China. As the First World War breaks out, the Emden is summoned to service and the sailor is unable to meet his wife. The SMS Emden then aids a sinking passenger ship and the officer discovers that his wife was on board the ill-fated liner. She is found among the rescued and the sailor is relieved. After the ship briefly ports and the sailor farewells his wife, the cruiser then meets the HMAS Sydney in battle and is sunk. Fortunately the officer escapes from the sinking vessel and is reunited with his wife.
