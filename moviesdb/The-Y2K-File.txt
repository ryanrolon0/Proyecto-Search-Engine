The Y2K File

 The story starts at the dawn of the new millennium. A man called Knock-Knock has just lost his parents in a fire that devastated the family house. Eager to move away from his frightening past he moved inside a big house in North London. The house used to be inhabited by a family of thirteen who mysteriously disappeared. When he was living in the house, a few events started to unfold; events that will terrify him, already traumatized by the death of his parents. Everyday he will confide a report of the events to a website, the Y2K Diary.
