The Lambertville Story

 Paul Whiteman, the orchestra leader, is a resident of the town of Libertyville, New Jersey, a quiet community where the farmers, including Mr. Whiteman, raise Black Angus cattle. His story is how the townspeople got to together in a town meeting to find a solution to the helter-skelter activities of the local teen-agers Saturday nights. The result was the building of the Lambertville Recreation Center, giving the kids a place to dance on Saturday nights.
