The Norman Conquests

 Three plays by Alan Ayckbourn, interwoven in plot and time, giving different views of the same weekend. The action takes place in the family home, now occupied by Annie. Norman tries to bring a little happiness to his wife, Ruth, his sister-in-law, Annie, and their sister-in-law, Sarah. Sarah and Reg arrive at mum's house for the weekend so that invalid mum's care-giver, Reg's sister Annie, can get away for the weekend. But Annie ends up staying, their brother-in-law Norman shows up unexpectedly, and not long after, so does Norman's wife Ruth (Annie and Reg's sister). Sarah tries her best to organize a family dinner for the five of them plus Tom, a slow-witted neighbor whom everyone expects to propose to Annie. Sarah can't get much cooperation and doesn't realize that Annie had planned to sneak off with Norman. Norman is incorrigible, Annie is caught between Tom and a fling, mum is upstairs demanding attention, and there aren't six proper chairs.
