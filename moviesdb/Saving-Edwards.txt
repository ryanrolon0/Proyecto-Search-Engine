Saving Edwards

 For the purposes of this film, Edwards is a child; a long-awaited child of a loving couple, a child struck with a terrible and fatal mistake at conception. Edwards had an extra chromosome, one more than the exact number required for the development of a healthy baby. This flaw causes severe developmental disorders that cannot support life. The condition was first described by American medical scientist John Alexander Edwards, hence the name Edwards Syndrome. Considering modern prenatal diagnostics, it is very uncommon for such children to be born. In the majority of cases, the pregnancy is terminated. The parents of this child decided otherwise. The film follows the struggle of the parents to save a child who was buried by many long before being born.
