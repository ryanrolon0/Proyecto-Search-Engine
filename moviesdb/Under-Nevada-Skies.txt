Under Nevada Skies

 Rodeo star Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers), returning with his horse "Trigger" to his home town, finds old Tom Craig (Leyland Hodgson) murdered and offers his aid to "acting sheriff" Gabby Whittaker (George Hayes). Roy meets Helen Williams (Dale Evans), new singer at the Trading Post club, who is on her way to see Craig about a family-heirloom crest which he has stolen from her father. Arthur Courtney (Douglass Dumbrille)is informed by his henchmen that Craig is dead but they were unable to find the crest since Gabby, Helen and Roy had appeared on the scene. He orders them to get rid of Roy and Helen. After narrowly missing being killed while on their way to an Indian pow-wow, Roy and Gabby go to the Craig ranch where they discover an old clock and the crest hidden it it. They are taken captive by Courtney's henchmen and watch Courtney press a catch on the crest and take out a piece of paper. A fight ensues and The Sons of the Pioneers (Bob Nolan, Tim Spencer, Hugh Farr, Karl Farr and "Shug" Fisher) and Roy's Indian friends come to Roy's and Gabby's aid. Villains have stolen a jeweled crest containing a map which shows the location of a uranium deposit. With the help of Gabby and Dale and a posse of Indians, Roy recovers the crest. Songs include "I want to go West", "Anytime Taht I'm with You," "Sea-goin' Cowboy" and "Ne Hah Nee."
