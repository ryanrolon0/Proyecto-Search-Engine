Tomorrow Calling

 Bill is shooting architectural photographs of "futuristic" buildings of the 30's for a coffee table book commissioned by Dialta. But as he frames up a deco bingo hall, a vast airship looms over him. Is it a dream? His friend Mervyn tells him it is a manifestation of the mass unconscious, a "semiotic ghost". Bill next sees people dressed like extras from "Things to Come", the futuristic fantasy. Mervyn advises Bill that there is no future, only a futuristic dream invented in the present, and that the cure is a large dose of pornography. Bill goes straight to the video shop and its top shelf.
