The Young Americans Project

 After graduating from college, four friends load up an RV and embark on a journey across America to find out what defines their generation. The group travels to all 48 continental states asking their peers the same questions they had been asking themselves. They explore issues such as race, the Internet, political awareness, the environment and pop culture. Along the road the foursome meets a cross section of American society, ranging from a farmer in Kansas to a drug dealer in New Mexico, from a cancer researcher in Boston to the founder of Facebook in Silicon Valley. 'The Young Americans Project' is a passionate portrayal of a generation, a meditation on coming of age in 21st Century America, and a rallying cry against apathy.
