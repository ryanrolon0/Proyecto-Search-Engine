Smatyvay udochki

 Two buddies, an obsessed Elvis fan and a run of the mill road worker, go fishing and catch the big one - a briefcase full of money. Once coming into fortune they find that getting a million dollars isn't as hard as keeping it long enough to save their own necks. With two ruthless killers and a high powered mafia king pin on their back, they find themselves stuck in a whirlwind of adventure, hilarity, and surreal circumstances.
