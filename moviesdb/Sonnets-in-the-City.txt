Sonnets in the City

 'Sonnets in the City', charts a group of young acting students on their journey to finding personal meaning and wisdom within more than fifteen of Shakespeare's juicier and more dramatic sonnets. The film intertwines deciphering and performing Shakespeare in the 21st century, the culmination of that process where fifteen sonnets come to life in New York City's luscious Slate Bar & Billiards in downtown Chelsea, and the back story of the relationships between the directors, coaches, teachers and students.
