Treatment Plan

 Treatment Plan - A psychiatric patient in a waterside hospital suffers from severe depression. The art therapist suggests a video camera, and the treatment plan develops. The film was shot over a five month period near the Verrazano Narrows, and inspired by the difficulties of encountering the possibilities and potentials of the high-definition image.
