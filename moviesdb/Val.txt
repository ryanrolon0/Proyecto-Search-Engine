Val

 Fall is a dance film about the natural cycle in which time plays an important part. We see the four seasons change. A Japanese man goes into free-fall and lands in a typically Dutch landscape. Here he becomes organically entwined with his surroundings. Fall is part of Point Taken. This project consists of four dance films for which Dutch choreographers and film makers joined to write a film plan. Four teams were selected to receive production funding.
