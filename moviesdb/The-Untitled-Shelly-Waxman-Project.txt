The Untitled Shelly Waxman Project

 In December 1969, a special squad of State's Attorney's Police raided a Black Panther apartment in Chicago and murdered Party Chairman Fred Hampton and Party Member, Mark Clark. William O'Neal was the Panthers' Chief of Security and an FBI informer, acting as part of J.Edgar Hoover's notorious COINTELPRO program intended to disrupt and discredit black organizations. In 1974 Shelly Waxman, Asst. U.S. Attorney was assigned to defend O'Neal and the FBI. When Waxman uncovered the truth, he quit his job and spoke out, putting himself in personal danger. Forced to leave Chicago, he will spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder.
