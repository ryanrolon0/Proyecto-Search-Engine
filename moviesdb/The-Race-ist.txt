The Race-ist

 As a kid in the eighties in South Africa, Lukas dreams of becoming a quarter mile racing champ. His mom tells him to stay away from those people because they are Racists. Lukas is too young to know what a racist is and hears it as 'Race-ist'. The Film follows his journey as a young man in modern South Africa where the limitation of color no longer applies... from Zero to hero in 10 seconds flat! With the help of two crazy Bio Chemists, Lukas will chase the title as quarter mile king of Brakpan!
