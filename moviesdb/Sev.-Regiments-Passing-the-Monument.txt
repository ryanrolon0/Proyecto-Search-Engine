Sev. Regiments Passing the Monument

 "This picture gives an excellent view of the commander-in-chief of the land and sea forces of the United States as he reviewed the troops who were participating in honoring the memory of one of our greatest generals. Thousands of men can be seen in line marching to the music of several bands, and one is inspired at the sight. The faces of the participants are perfect, and the popular ones easily recognized."
