The Magic Tree

 This animated folk tale from the Congo centers around twin brothers, Luemba and Mavungu. When the neglected and unloved brother Mavungu finally leaves home, he finds a tree blocking the river and frees the people imprisoned within the tree. Mavungu wins the love of a beautiful princess and receives the strength, beauty, power and love he has desired all his life--as long as he never reveals the secret of the Magic Tree.
