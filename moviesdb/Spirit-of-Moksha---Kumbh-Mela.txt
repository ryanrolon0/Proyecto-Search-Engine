Spirit of Moksha - Kumbh Mela

 Kumbh Mela is the biggest gathering of human beings on earth at a particular point of time, irrespective of race, religion, caste, gender and age.. The tradition of Kumbh Mela is very ancient. Spirit of Moksha is a journey through the belief, reason and myth. How the theory of Moksha evolved and why it still remains intact, rather it has been gaining more acceptance with time. 80 million people took the holy dip in Ganga during Maha KUMBH 2010 in Haridwar. The documentary is self explanatory from talks of the sages, pilgrims and scholars without any voiceover. The treatment and design of the film is simple to make you realize the beauty of faith, trust and power of belief which can be experienced.
