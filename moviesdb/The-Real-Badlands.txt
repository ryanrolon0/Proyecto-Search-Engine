The Real Badlands

 Fed up with modern day life, Simon Burgess and Susan Moran quit their jobs, sell all of their possessions and move into a remote forest in deepest, darkest Nottinghamshire. With winter on the way, will the couple and their relationship be able to survive all the mother nature can throw at them? Watch as Simon, a self proclaimed survival expert attempts to provide for himself and Susan in an unfamiliar and unforgiving world, with hilarious results! The Real Badlands is a film about the ultimate urban escape, it's a film that offers an alternative to the nine - five grind, an alternative that has been described by critics as stranger than fiction!
