Relax Yourself

 A young teen boy awakes in slow motion, his alarm clock at 8 A.M. He moves slowly through breakfast and misses the bus to school. Skateboard in hand, he spends a day of leisure, playing video games, eating a giant hamburger, playing basketball, and otherwise occupying himself as if in a 45 rpm rock video played at an hallucinogenic 33.3 speed. That night, he falls slowly into bed.
