Roulette Night

 Set in the late night haze of an anonymous gay bar, a bartender struggles with his ex-lover for a young man's soul. There are times we all feel lost, moments when the darkness closes in, when we long for meaning, purpose. Sometimes the quest for clarity leads into the shadows. Set against the backdrop of the cultural phenomenon known as bug chasing, 'Roulette Night' explores how far some will go to find themselves-the quest for meaning, love, and purpose in life-even if that quest may lead to self-destruction.
