The Sterilization of Leilani Muir

 This film deals with one woman's attempt to sue the government of the Canadian province of Alberta for sterilizing her against her will because she was considered a "mental defective". In short, she was a victim of a government policy that followed quack medical theories about eugenics in a manner that differed for the methods of Nazi Germany only by degree.
