But both fall in love with each other. Nirjala's family refuse to permit her to get married to him. They force her to get married to the man of their choice. In the meantime, Radhe gets into fight, and someone hits him very hard on his head. Radhe loses his senses and falls down. When he wakes him, he finds himself a mental patient. The hospital finds him very violent and they chain. He is unable to remember his past. Then Nirjala re-enters his life. Will this cure Radhe or make him even worse? Radhe Mohan is a bad boy. He smokes, drinks, brawls and rags college freshers. Worse, he hangs around the same college campus he passed out of years ago and has never cared about looking for a job which angers his elder brother.

He slowly wins her heart over but they don't know what fate has in store for them . An old enemy attacks Radhe and cracks his head in the process. As a result, Radhe loses his mental balance.
