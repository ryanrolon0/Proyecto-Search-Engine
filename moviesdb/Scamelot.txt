Scamelot

 In the small town of Camelot, Oregon where our anti-heroes Miles Logan and Todd Slunk spend their days scamming and manipulating the townspeople. The duo, along with Miles' reluctant girlfriend Sarah, lives vicariously by throwing large parties, then stealing the identities and money from all in attendance. They have swindled just about everyone in Camelot, including Police Sheriff Cody and Judge Brown. The lives of Miles and Todd go awry when the town administers a new district attorney, Dirk Fillencio, who is determined to shut down their criminal actions."
