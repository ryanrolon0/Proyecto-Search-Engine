Tim Tyler's Luck

 A 12-episode serial in which Tim Tyler goes to Africa in search of his father in gorilla country. He meets up with Laura, who is after Spider Webb who has framed her brother. Webb causes the death of Tim's father, but is eventually tracked down. This was Universal's 37th sound-era serial (between "Radio Patrol" and "Flash Gordon's Trip To Mar") and was based on the long-running King Features comic strip by Lyman Young. Tim Tyler and his sidekick, Spud had been members of The Ivory Patrol in adventures in the newspapers prior to the making of this serial, but the story here starts with Tim coming to Africa in search of his father, Professor Tyler, a noted scientist who has gone to the gorilla country and turned up missing. Tim stows away on a river steamer and meets Lora Lacey, posing as Lora Graham who is searching for "Spider" Webb, an ivory-safari robber and thief of a diamond, and Lora's brother is unjustly serving time for the theft. Lora and Tim pursue Webb, which leads them to Tim's captive father, and they are able to beat Webb and his minions, vindicate Lora's brother and share a vast ivory treasure.
