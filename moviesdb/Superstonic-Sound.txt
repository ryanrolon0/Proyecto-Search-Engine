Superstonic Sound

 Don Letts is an unsung hero of British music. Told in Letts' unique voice, 'Superstonic Sound' is a documentary about his family legacy that mirrors the history of Bass in the UK and his fighting for identity for being the first generation of British born Black. A journey from Dub and Reggae to the legendary very first Punk club 'The Roxy' in the mid-seventies, crossing Hip Hop towards Dubstep; a musical, cultural and personal travel between past and present.
