Severe Injuries

 Melvin Hubble is the last in a long line of unsuccessful serial killers. Fulfilling his father's dying wish, Melvin sneaks into the Ro Ro Ro sorority house on the night of a big party and completely fails to strike fear into the hearts of the inhabitants. Unbeknownst to Melvin and the girls, there is another killer lurking in the house - one just as inept, but lacking in the courage of Melvin's convictions.
