Siam to Korea

 This Traveltalk entry first visits Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, when the country's name was still Siam. Then it's off to Seoul, South Korea. When the visit was made in the early 1930s, Korea was not yet divided and was a province administered by Japan. The film emphasized the deep influence of Buddhism on the daily life of the peoples in both countries.
