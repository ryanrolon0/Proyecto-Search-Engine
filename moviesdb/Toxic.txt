Toxic

 A documentary on people with Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS). Unable to tolerate even the smallest amount of chemicals, such as deodorant, ink, perfume or soap, victims of MCS seek refuge in the desert of Arizona. Isolated from society they try to convince friends, relatives and neighbours that they suffer from a life threatening illness. But nobody seems to understand or is prepared to listen.
