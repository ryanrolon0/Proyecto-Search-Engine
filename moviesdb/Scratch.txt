Scratch

 Lena is a young art student new to London. Calling it her art project, she obsessively follows and takes pictures of an unwitting Sol. He is a scruffy, charismatic 20 year old, by all appearances homeless, who drifts around in numerous detached relations to people affiliated with the art scene. Her project takes a wrong turn when Sol discovers her. Fascinated by her odd behaviour, Sol is now the one to follow her. Against a backdrop of contemporary East-London, Sol and Lena gradually expose each other's dreams, fears and lies.
