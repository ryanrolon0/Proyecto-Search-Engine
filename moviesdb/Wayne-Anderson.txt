Wayne Anderson

 Truly obsessed by the power of music, Wayne Anderson is no ordinary man. He's a man with a dream release an album; an album of covers versions of the Evergreens, Tom Jones, Englebert Humperdink and Tony Christie. With his inexperienced yet committed manager Orlando giving his all to see Wayne succeed, this is a journey into the very heart of the New Zealand dream. Two men with a cause, two men fighting against public indifference, two men who refuse to give up.
