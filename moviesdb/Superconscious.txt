Superconscious

 Sonny, a talented young photographer and artist, has recently lost his eyesight. Through the wonderful discovery of his inviting super-conscious realm, Sonny sets off on an enchanting journey to a most heightened sense of spiritual being where he is able to see, hear, feel, recall and understand so much more about his world, and his place in this world, than he ever could before he lost his physical sight.
