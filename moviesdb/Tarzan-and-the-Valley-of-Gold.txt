Tarzan and the Valley of Gold

 The international criminal Vinaro enjoys sending explosive wristwatches to his enemies. Here he kidnaps ten-year-old Ramel whom he thinks can lead him to the lost city of gold. Tarzan fights the evil Mr. Train, six-foot-six bodyguard of Vinaro, and rescues Sophia, who has been left to die with an explosive around her neck. Various animals help Tarzan locate Vinaro's tanks and helicopters, the city and the boy. Tarzan battles a megalomaniacal millionaire named Vinero, who kidnaps a young boy whom he believes can lead him to a legendary city of gold. Vinero is accompanied by his own army, including bald henchman Mr. Train and gorgeous moll Sophia. Tarzan wears a business suit and carries a briefcase.
