Pyaasa Sawan

 While looking for employment, Chandrakant is mistaken for the son of a wealthy landlord by Prabhudas, who wants him to marry his only daughter, Shanti. By the time they find out the truth, it is too late, both Chandrakant and Shanti have fallen in love, and are soon married. With lots of hard work, and dedication, Chandrakant is able to build small empire, and they too enjoy some wealth and wellbeing. Shanti gives birth to a son, Ravi. Years pass, Shanti has passed away, and Chandrakant is filled with regret that he did not spend much time with her, as he was busy accumulating wealth. Ravi is in love with Manorama, and does marry her. But then he too is caught up in making money, like his dad. And unlike Shanti, Manorama will not compromise with this situation, unless Ravi changes his lifestyle, which he may not be willing to do so.
