The Swing School

 Betty Boop is conducting the animal-students in as singing lesson, in her School for Pets, but Pudy the Pup keeps hitting sour notes. Betty sends him to the dunce's stool, where Pudgy's cute sweetie comes to console him. Her kiss gives Pudy a new lease on life and music. He leads the class in a swing version of Betty's theme song.
