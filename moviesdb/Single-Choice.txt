Single Choice

 Single at thirty-six and with my biological clock ticking, I investigate using artificial insemination with donor sperm to become a single mother and discover its many complications. Diving into the ethics, definitions of family and identity, and other issues it raises, I explore this controversial topic through the intimate perspectives of mothers, donor-conceived individuals, donors, and the sperm banking industry in order to educate viewers about assisted reproductive technologies, its challenges and the growing trend of alternative families.
