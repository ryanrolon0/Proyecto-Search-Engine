Shao Lin xiong di

 Complicated mix of Chinese history and myth, where old Shaolin friends find themselves on different sides, one a Ching general, and the other faithful to Ming. Deception is used as well as kung fu skills to move the plot on. Humourous parts actually confuse the whole story, but is full of entertaining martial art action.
