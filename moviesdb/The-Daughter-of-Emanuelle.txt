The Daughter of Emanuelle

 Emanuelle's daughter Pussy introduces her to her new lover and she suffers a flash of recognition. The American man standing in front of her looks familiar, rather like a lover she had some 20 years earlier. A lover that had jilted her at the altar but not before making her pregnant. It can't be the same man... can it? Well, can it?
