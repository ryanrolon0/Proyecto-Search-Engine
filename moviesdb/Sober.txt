Sober

 A man, bruised and confused, wakes up to find himself tied to a chair in a dark, dank room in the midst of a brutal war. He is being held for questioning concerning the context of encoded transmissions which may be integral in stopping the war. His interrogator, an intelligence agent, wants desperately to know what the codes mean, but the prisoner screams ignorance. Suddenly another prisoner, a civilian woman, is thrown in the same room for intelligence questioning, and soon both prisoners become more and more obstinate, leaving the interrogator no choice but to get savagely violent. But when that tactic fails to yield anymore new information, the interrogator resorts to one last desperate move to get the prisoners to talk, a move which will drastically change the lives of all three forever.
