Senorita from the West

 Jeannie Blake is an aspiring singer living in the desert with her three gold-prospecting guardians, Dusty, Rosebud and Cap. She leaves for New York in order to get a job and pay back her three guardians and doesn't know they have found gold and are holding it in trust for her. She gets a job as an elevator girl at a radio station and meets Phil Bradley whose singing voice is used for that of Tim Winters, the current heart-throb of the airwaves who can't sing at all. Winters also finds out that Jeannie has wealth and proceeds to convince her he is in love with her. The three rustic guardians show up, expose Winters for the fraud he is and Jeannie realizes she is really in love with Phil, who also replaces Winters as the station's singer.
