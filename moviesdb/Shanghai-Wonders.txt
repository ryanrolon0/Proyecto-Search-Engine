Shanghai Wonders

 Shanghai was influenced by Western Europe in 1800's and early 1900's. Shanghai was not glowing much during 1930's through 1980's due to economic slump. However, from 1990's, Shanghai started to glow fast due to oversea investments and purchases of Chinese goods from the United States and Western nations. Today, Shanghai is fastest glowing city in China with population of around 21 million people. Shanghai Expo 2010 epitomized Shanghai economic growth with 'Better City and Better Life' theme.
