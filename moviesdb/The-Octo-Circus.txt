The Octo Circus

 A couple of proud clown parents and their soon-to-be eight clown babies. The proud father, Howdy the Clown, learns that men can give birth too. So, he feels that he'd 'like to bring more clowns into the world himself' and does. Clowns are people too. Look around you. They may not be wearing make-up but they're there in hospitals, on reality TV, sitting next to you on the bus and in traffic. HONK! HONK! We're all clowns and the whole world's our stage. Smile. Better yet, Laugh!
