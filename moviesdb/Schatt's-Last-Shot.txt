Schatt's Last Shot

 Todd Solondz plays a high schooler who wants to get into MIT. The only problem is, his gym teacher hates him, and fails him because he can't hit a shot in basketball. He also has no luck with the girl of his dreams, who considers him a great friend, but wishes he were more like Coach. To prove himself, he challenges the teacher to a one-on-one match (and hilarity ensues).
