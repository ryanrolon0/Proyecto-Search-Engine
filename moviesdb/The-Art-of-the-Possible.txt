The Art of the Possible

 This film explores how a typical government in Canada goes about its governing activities by following the Ontario Provincial government cabinet under Premier Bill Davis through a busy time of the year of the government. So, we follow the Premier and his cabinet as they meet to discuss policy, attend intergovernmental summits, hear petitioners, and work on essential activities such as the drafting of the government budget. All the while, they jockey for political advantage as they make decision that will not alienate the voters as they perform the art of the possible.
