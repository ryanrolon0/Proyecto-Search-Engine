The Corrs

 The Corrs, the Irish sibling supergroup, play a special St. Patrick's Day concert at Britain's famous Royal Albert Hall to coincide with the release of their sophomore album, "Talk On Corners." Special guest Mick Fleetwood plays drums for three songs, including "Dreams," "Haste to the Wedding," and "Toss the Feathers."
