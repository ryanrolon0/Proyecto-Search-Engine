The Medicine Man

 Mamie and Buddy, the son and daughter of a cruel, abusive shopkeeper, are excited when Dr. Harvey's medicine show comes to town. But when they slip away at night to watch the show, their father finds out and punishes them severely. When the angry father then decides to force Mamie to marry against her will, she turns to Dr. Harvey for help. Meanwhile, two of the doctor's associates have been playing a confidence game, and have attracted the attention of the local sheriff.
