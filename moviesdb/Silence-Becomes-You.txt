Silence Becomes You

 Two sisters, Grace and Violet, bound together by more than blood, live a reclusive life in a large mansion, detached from society and reality too. They have a plan. It's hardly conventional, but the outcome nine months later is all that counts. Whatever they do they must not fall in love with the man that they choose to ensnare. Set in contemporary New England. Two sisters, Violet and Grace, very bounded to each other, live in an old mansion with ghosts of their past. Violet meets Luke in a bar, and brings him to her mansion. Along the days, she seduces him, and they have sex many times as part of a plot with Grace. When Luke decides to leave the house with Violet, Grace tries to avoid, and Luke finds that they are trapped in the place.
