The Goat.

 Chuck and Dawn are grad students and aspiring writers. They've been aspiring so long it's hard to remember why they started. As they struggle with a bad semester in a discouraging program, and the possible rewards shrink in proportion to the growing personal sacrifices, the question looms... why is being a writer even worth it? That's the gist of The Goat. (the period is part of the title), adapted by Jack Bennett from Atlanta-based writer Nick Tyler's short story of ennui and frustrated desire.
