RKO Sportscope

 This Sportscope, filmed at the 1939 U. S. Open, details the science of the approach shot, as demonstrated by members of the Professional Golfers of America Horton Smith, Jimmy Thompson, Ed Dudley and Dick Metz. They perform shots from sand and water traps, and approach shots to the green over trees and bunkers, all broken down to slow-motion details.
