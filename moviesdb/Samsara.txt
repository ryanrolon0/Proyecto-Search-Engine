Samsara

 According to Indian mythology, time and space is an endless cycle of creation and destruction. This cycle is divided into four stages, the last of which is known as the Kaliyuga stage. The same stage we're in today. In the midst of an unexplainable solar crisis, Jeff (Jeff Chapman) mysteriously finds himself traveling back through time when he looks into an eclipse. In an attempt to fix the future, he desperately tries to change the past not knowing that nature has a will of its own.
