The Bognor Birdman Competition

 Founded in 1971, the International Bognor Birdman Festival is a human powered flight competition held each summer in the seaside resort of Bognor Regis on England's south coast. Many contestants participate merely to raise money for charities, others design & attempt to fly complex machines to aim for the distance prizes. A prize of 25,000 pounds is offered for the furthest flight over 100 metres. This Discovery Channel special documented the 2002 Birdman competition.
