The Smoky Stove

 An old-fashioned parlor stove has started to smoke, and the mistress of the house calls in the kitchen maid to remedy the trouble. While the girl is fussing with the stove it explodes and the girl is blown to the ceiling. She arises, however, not much the worse for her experience, making a very laughable finish to the scene.
