Travel Queeries

 Travel Queeries examines the culture, art and activism of radical queers in contemporary Europe. Through personal interviews and documentation of performances, festivals, multi-media visual arts and spaces, Travel Queeries puts an exciting international lens on queer fringe culture. With the aim of building bridges and awareness, Travel Queeries considers the word "queer" and explores the complexities, innovative values and spirit of queer within a progressive social change movement.
