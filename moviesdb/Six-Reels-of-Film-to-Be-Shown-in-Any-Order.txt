Six Reels of Film to Be Shown in Any Order

 An aleatory film different color and contains two scenes. The film reels are supplied to the projectionist with a die with each of the colors on a side. The projectionist rolls the die to determine the running order of the reels. The story is designed so that each ordering creates different implications to the film as a whole.
