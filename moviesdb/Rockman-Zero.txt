Rockman Zero

 Taking place 100 years after Zero's ending on Rockman X6 (or Mega Man X6), the world was at peace. However, "Rockman X (or Mega Man X)" started to terminate innocent reploids to ensure that there won't be any Irregulars (or Mavericks) attacking the innocent. In a desperate attempt on the current war, a human scientist named Ciel searches for the legendary Zero. Zero is shortly awakened by Ciel, but has a memory loss. Zero must help the newly-made Resistance forces, terminate "Rockman X," and find out his true identity. Little does Zero know that the Rockman X ruling Neo Arcadia is just a copy created by Ciel shortly after the real Rockman X's disappearance.
