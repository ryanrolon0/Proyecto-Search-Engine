The Battle of the Alamo

 A re-enactment of the 13-day siege of the Alamo, the defining moment of the Texas revolution. Extensive use is made of original documents, from both sides of the battle, with legend (the famous line in the sand) presented as legend, and no historical rewriting. Filmed where it happened, on the 160th anniversary of the death of 189 heroes who died for Texas independence on March 6, 1836.
