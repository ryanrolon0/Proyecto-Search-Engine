Rafoo Chakkar

 Refusing to obey their widower father, Harbans Singh, and get married to the girls of his choice, two slacker brothers, Manjeet and Parmeet, run away from home with Five Lakh Rupees. After their cash is stolen, they take to crime, are arrested, but subsequently released. They end up getting arrested again - this time for Attempted Murder & Attempted Rape - and the only way they can escape conviction and a long prison term is by getting married to their victims - two elderly heiress' sisters, Kokila and Koena Chandnani.
