The Pickle Guys

 A short film by Richie Siegel, explores the transformation of the Lower East Side, especially the original merchants still remaining. The Pickle Guys, one of the last independent pickle shops in America, still does things the old-fashioned way. Whether it's the original recipes or the size of the store, nothing has changed. The film captures the essence of what the Lower East Side used to be and what still remains. Allen Kaufman, owner of The Pickle Guys, embraces the old customs of Manhattan. He works hard, and enjoys every moment. The short film screened as a work in progress at the Future of Cinema International Film Festival in Interlochen, MI.
