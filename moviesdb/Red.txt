Red

 A re-imagining of the classic fairy tale "Little Red Riding Hood". Told in a typically dark film-noir style, the story follows a disillusioned and overworked detective on his trail to uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of Red, a young girl known for her flowing red cape, in a seedy, crime-stricken city.
