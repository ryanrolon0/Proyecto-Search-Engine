Public Ghost # 1

 A mad inventor escapes from an asylum. The same day, Charley, a nice guy who's out of work, meets a terrific gal who suggests he ask her father for a job. Misunderstandings lead Charley to think the madman is the magnate; he convinces Charley to hire out as a house haunter. A real estate agent needs to scare the owners into leaving a particular house, so he hires Charley. Charley steals into the house that night and starts making scary noises. Turns out it's the house of the gal and her dad. Unbeknownst to Charley, the madman sneaks in to add to the haunting. Soon father, daughter, and Charley are scared witless. Rescue comes from an odd source.
