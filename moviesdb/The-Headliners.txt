The Headliners

 Set during the great depression when bank robbers were viewed as heros to most, The Headliners is a melodrama about 3 knuckle-heads trying to rob their way to the front page. After two failed attempts in a Midwestern town, Tommy Gunrow, Johnny Malone and Frankie 'Flap Jack' Johnson are giving it one more shot to make the headlines.
