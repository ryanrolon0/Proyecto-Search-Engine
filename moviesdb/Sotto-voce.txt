Sotto voce

 Certain that she has just killed her parents, a young adult escapes the scene of the murders only to encounter an enigmatic inquisitor who accosts her in a public park. Her fear of the stranger is surpassed only by her fear of herself and what she might be or might become next. She runs from him only to discover that she can no longer separate reality from false perception, and she will never be able to escape him.
