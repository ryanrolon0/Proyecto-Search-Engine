The Revenge of Tarzan

 Tarzan and Jane are sailing for France in answer to a call for help from Countess de Coude who is being persecuted by her brother Rokoff. After a duel with the Countess' jealous husband, Tarzan goes to Africa and arrives in time to save Jane (who has since been shipwrecked with Rokoff) from a lion.
