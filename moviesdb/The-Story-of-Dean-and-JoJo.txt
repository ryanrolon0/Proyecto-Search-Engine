The Story of Dean and JoJo

 In 1984, Dean Bernal first encountered a wild dolphin named JoJo in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Over the next twenty years they forge a unique, trusting bond that has taken Dean beyond dolphin research and human experience. Because JoJo lives in close proximity to resorts and is curious about human activity, JoJo is subjected to harassment and injury from boats, water skis, and jet skis. Dean learns how to treat JoJo's injuries and strives to obtain government protection for JoJo as a national treasure.
