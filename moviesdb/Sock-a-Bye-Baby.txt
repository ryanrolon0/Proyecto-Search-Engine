Sock-a-Bye Baby

 The stooges mistakenly kidnap a baby they find on their doorstep. When the cops and the baby's mother come looking for the baby, the boys panic and flee into the country with the cops (one of them is the baby's father) pursuing them by motorcycle. It all ends happily with the baby reunited with its parents and the stooges running off disguised as bushes.
