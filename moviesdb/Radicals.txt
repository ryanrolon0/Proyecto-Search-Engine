Radicals

 Two best friends lose their jobs due to corporate cutbacks. Forced into a job market of fruitless searches. They're diverted into a couple of radicals. They do what they have to do to survive. They strong arm a few businesses to settle themselves but look for more by kidnapping a white-man and holding him for ransom. Two million dollars in two weeks. The new intelligent criminal has arrived. The one that America fears. Hold on to your seats. Radicals is pure madness.
