Viy

 While losing himself, wandering home whilst on leave from his seminary, novice monk Khoma stays in the barn of an old woman. A scuffle breaks out. Later, he is summonsed to stand and prey over a young dead woman, in the local church, for three nights. It is here that while in the long, dark nights, of the locked doors, that the dead regain life, the souls of Hell taunt the young monk to near terrifying insanity and the test of Faith will be as powerful as the witches, monsters and the mighty demon Viy who haunt his every step and bay for his very soul.
