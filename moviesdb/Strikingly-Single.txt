Strikingly Single

 Shea Thomas is a great catch, the only problem is she can't seem to find a guy who is. Convinced that true love is eluding her, she ends a perfectly fine relationship with her boyfriend to pursue greener fields. Applying the rules of baseball to her blind dates, the guys have 3 chances to stay in the game. As the umpire of her own love life, it's up to Shea to make the right call, if and when the right guy steps up to the plate.
