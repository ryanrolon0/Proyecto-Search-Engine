The Last Leaf

 A small New York apartment was a favorite location for an O. Henry story. He is reported to have said, "I would like to live a lifetime in each street in New York. Every house has a drama in it." Here, just around the corner from the turn of the century, in Greenwich Village, we find two young struggling artists who've become the best of friends only to have one stricken with deadly Pneumonia. And she is convinced that when the last leaf falls from the ivy outside her window, that she will go too. "The lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious, far journey." And yet against the howling wind, as the rain beats at the window, one small ray of hope bravely clings on against the storm.
