The Making of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'

 This documentary follows various stages in the production of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). Making of... starts with pre-production interviews with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, then follows them to Sri Lanka where the exteriors were shot, and later to London, where many interior shots were made. It focuses on the character Indiana Jones' origins, on Kate Capshaw in the bug sequence, on the chase through the mines (with the mine-train), and on the climactic bridge sequence among other things.
