Tito i ja

 The story of a ten years old boy who, as most of the children in Yugoslavia of the fifties can hardly imagine his life without the great national leader - marshal Tito. In his school, he wins the contest for the best Tito's composition. His reward is the participation in "Tito's native land" march. He claims in his work that he loves Tito more than his Dad and Mom, which makes them desperate. He does not understand what is so confusing and weird in his love towards the leader. This march will be a difficult temptation for him. Unaccustomed to nature, walks and independent living, harassed by the teacher, Stalinist, he fails, gets lost in the mountain and his life changes.
