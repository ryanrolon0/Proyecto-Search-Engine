Surf Scene on the Pacific

 This scene taken on the Pacific Ocean shows the angry sea far out towards the horizon, an unbroken expanse of surging billows. The waves come in gradually, flecked with floating foam, throwing a shining spray of marvelous beauty over the rocks, a scene once seen never to be forgotten. One to bring forth the applause of any audience.
