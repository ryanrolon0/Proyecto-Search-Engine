Waste Paper Basket

 A small plastic waste paper basket with a smiley face sits in an elevator lobby. As people exit the elevator, they are lured to the waste paper basket as it begins to play music. One young man soon discovers that the small yellow waste paper basket isn't so innocent after all when it swallows his pen.
