Wayne County Ramblin'

 Interweaving fact, folklore, fiction, religion, and lies, Wayne County Ramblin' seeks to reveal its' landscape as part of a great creole nation. It is at heart a road movie that travels south, in the opposite direction of the historical great migration of African-Americans. The story centers around young European-Americans Penny & her boyfriend Johnny, who leave Detroit in search of Penny's long-lost Grandfather, Simon, who is believed to be now-retired and living in his native Mississippi. Mugged and tied-up by the side of the road, they meet Jim, also from Michigan, heading to Mississippi on college break to chase the ghost of William Faulkner. Jim initially appears a fortunate opportunity to achieve their goal but sexual tensions and insecurities quickly cloud and threaten their destinations. But even if they are not aware of it, these three young Americans' lives are being directed by three west-African spirits, who are leading them to a better sense of who they really are.
