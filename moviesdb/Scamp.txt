Scamp

 Red and Johnny are a destitute father and son making their way through a hard life on the streets of Tacoma. Red, a burnt out, middle-aged con man has measured his success by what he has in his pockets at any given time; a lighter, a pack of cigarettes and the company of Johnny, his 8 year old pick pocket son. These two grifters have carved a niche in Tacoma, turning simple cons and sometimes-complex schemes to make their living. One weekend, Johnny and Red find there way into trouble when an undercover police officer picks up their trail of pick-pocketing victims and con jobs and forces young Johnny to make his way on his own.
