Secret Intersex

 "Reveals the impact of conditions long shrouded in secrecy on people's everyday lives. Six-year-old Xenia and 16-year-old Ilizane are 'sisters' who were born with CAIS (Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome), a condition that means that both were born chromosomally male, but - unable to respond to testosterone - they developed as 'girls'. Their parents decided to raise them to be aware of their condition from an early age, despite conventional medical wisdom. Other stories include Louise, who is a 'true hermaphrodite', born with part ovary, part testes inside. Doctors told her mother to raise Louise as a girl, keeping her condition a secret and operating on her to give her a female appearance. Meanwhile Lilia faces a tough decision on whether to allow surgeons to operate on her child Bianca, who was born with an intersex condition where a baby girl is flooded with testosterone in the womb".
