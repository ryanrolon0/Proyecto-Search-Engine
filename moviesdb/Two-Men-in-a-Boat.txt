Two Men in a Boat

 Spring travels up through Britain at the pace of a walking man. This chance-heard quote struck Jeremy Norman as an intensely romantic notion, and, along with his partner Derek Frost, he set out to find the proof. Chartering Kalani, an 80-foot, twin-screw motor yacht, they set out on an amazing journey, chasing spring up the west coast of the British Isles. This charming film documents their extraordinary odyssey.
