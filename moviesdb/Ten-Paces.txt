Ten Paces

 "She innocently took his hand...and he innocently kissed hers..." With these words a modest farmhand, Robert, professes his love for an aristocrat's daughter. Rachel returns Robert's affection but is tragically forced into the arms of another man by her wealth-seeking father. Will love prevail over greed or, like Candide, will it become Robert's downfall? Ten paces and two pistols will decide Robert's fate and the fate of the woman he loves.
