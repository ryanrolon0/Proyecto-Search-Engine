Uncle Jim's Dairy Farm

 Two siblings from the city visit their uncle's dairy farm for the summer. The children tour the farm's modern facilities, including milking machines. During a summer of hard work and healthy living, the boy gains enough strength to finally climb a rope. At the end of the summer, the city-dwellers return to the metropolis with their family, wiser and healthier for having spent their summer on their uncle's farm.
