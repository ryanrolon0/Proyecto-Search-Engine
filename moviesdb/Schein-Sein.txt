Schein Sein

 'Schein Sein' is based on Morton Feldman's music piece 'Madame Press Died Last Week at Ninety', performed by the Vienna based Klangforum under it's conductor Beat Furrer. The film plays with the levels of optic and aural perception, with the deception of eyes and ears and the tension between two-dimensional reproduction and three-dimensional spatial recreation.
