 Hoping to experience what it is like to be an immigrant, the filmmaker sets off on a reverse journey that her great grandparents made in 1906. In 2006 Naomi Uman came to Ukraine, knowing no one, not speaking the language, and began a life in a small village where people still live as if it were 100 years ago.
