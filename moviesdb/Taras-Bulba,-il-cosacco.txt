Taras Bulba, il cosacco

 Cossack chief Taras Bulba, aiming to conquer neighboring Poland and her Tartar allies, sends his sons Ostap and Andrei to study in the Polish city Dubno to learn more about Polish customs and strengths. Andrei, however, falls in love with the Polish governor's daughter Natalia. When the Cossacks march on Dubno, Andrei is imprisoned, but escapes back to his father. Taras Bulba dictates peace terms to the Poles, which include taking Natalia as hostage. Although Natalia agrees, Andrei rebels against his father and takes the girl back to the city. In the ensuing battle, both Andrei and Natalia are killed, but the two fathers declare peace.
