The Silken Affair

 Spoiler involved with a motivating model, 'tweaks' the books of a stocking-factory whose owner he likes so it will show a 'paper' profit and stave off bankruptcy, and then juggles the books of a rival firm, whose owner he detests, to show it, on paper, teetering on the edge of ruin. His book-cooking is soon discovered, but by buying the stocks of the first one and then the other, he finds himself in control of both. After a tangle with the law and a farce of a trial, he takes over both operations, merges the two, with the former owners as his partners, kisses the model goodbye and returns to his unsuspecting wife.
