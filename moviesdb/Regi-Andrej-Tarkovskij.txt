Regi Andrej Tarkovskij

 During the shooting of Andrei Tarkovsky's last film Offret, cameraman Arne Carlsson taped around 50 hours of behind the scenes footage. Editor Michal Leszczylowski took the material and added scenes of previous interviews and interesting statements from the script of Offret and from Tarkovsky's book 'Sculpting in Time'. The result is a documentary that shows the way Tarkovksy worked things he did Tarkovsky the house going up in flames.
