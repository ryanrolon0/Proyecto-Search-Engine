They Call It All-States

 Sponsored by the National Farmers Union, "They Call It All-States" documents a summer camp for 250 farm kids from all over the US who are shown working, playing, having a folk dance, and engaging in other summer-camp-like activities. Produced in the late 1950's, it is in color and contains narration (no live sound).
