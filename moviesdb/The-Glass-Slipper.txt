The Glass Slipper

 A naive (and pious) girl decides to seek a bit of adventure and to leave the small-town life behind. Taking on a job as a live-in nanny in the household of a disintegrating Silicon Valley family, she is charmed by the worldly wit of her dour employer's ex-husband. As he begins in turn to express some interest in her, she must decide just how adventurous she's prepared to be.
