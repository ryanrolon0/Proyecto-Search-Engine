The Assistants

 A doctor who lives in an isolated manor hires a new girl to be his assistant. In the basement of the house he carries on his personal work, which he tells the girl is his own personal hobby, and which she is never to investigate. The basement is off limits. Eventually the girl's curiosity gets the better of her and she descends into the basement where she discovers the doctor's hobby has something to do with cutting up a dead body. The doctor, asleep upstairs, begins to writhe in bed, and his sleeping actions translate to the movements of the corpse, which suddenly reanimates and strangles the girl. The doctor is forced to bury her in a small, private cemetery, where we can see he has already buried several assistants before her.
