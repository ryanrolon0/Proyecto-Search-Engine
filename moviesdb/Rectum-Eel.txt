Rectum Eel

 A husband has returned to his wife after disappearing, with no explanation, for three years. He explains to her that he had taken some awesome drugs that would make him shit for three days. Whilst in the toilet, he falls into a shaking trance where he is visited by the Structuralist Dream Devil and his Constructivist Gimp. They proceed to cruelly show him things that look like breasts and penises but arent. Set in a surrealist realm, Rectum Eel experiments with linking elements of phantasmagoria, kinestasis and scratch film to create a magical social realism comedy narrative about a drug addict succumbing to his demons.
