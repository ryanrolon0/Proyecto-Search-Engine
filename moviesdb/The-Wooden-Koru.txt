The Wooden Koru

 In an instant Madeleine's life has been changed by a brutal attack. Ten years later, Daniel, her assailant, has been released from prison and she has asked him to meet her where they met before. Daniel arrives, seeking the chance to face her face, so that he can move on. She wants him to look after her for the rest of her life. In this dramatic and sometimes funny film we see the destruction of their lost lives and recognise that there is the possibility for forgiveness and redemption and maybe more.
