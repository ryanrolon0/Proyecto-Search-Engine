Ram-Avtar

 Ram and Avtar are both childhood best friends. The difference between the two friends is that Ram would willingly make priceless sacrifice for his friend; the time when both are separated is when Ram goes abroad to further his studies. In the mean while Avtar takes up employment in an organization run by Sangeeta. Avtar is romantically attracted to Sangeeta but Sangeeta falls in love with Ram; when Ram gets to know that Avtar is in love with Sangeeta he decides to sacrifice his love for his friend sake by getting Avtar married to Sangeeta. But one of Sangeeta's enemies Gundappaswami is willing to expose Ram and Sangeeta's relationship to Avtar. Avtar (Anil Kapoor) is employed in an organization that is run by Sangeeta (Sridevi). He falls in love with her. His best friend, Ram (Sunny Deol) arrives there to meet him, and also falls in love with Sangeeta, who also falls in love with him. Ram comes to know that Avtar loves Sangeeta, and for the sake of their friendship, he steps away, and allows them to marry each other. Some time later, Gundappa Swami (Shakti Kapoor), while dying, tells Avtar that his wife is a woman of questionable character. Avtar starts suspecting his wife, and his wife calls upon Ram for help. How will Ram's arrival assist their marriage?
