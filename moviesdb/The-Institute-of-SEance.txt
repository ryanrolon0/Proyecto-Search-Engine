The Institute of SEance

 Murder! The director of the County Institute of Science is found dead in her office, clutching a handful of feathers. A pool of blood, a locked door, no witnesses-the local constabulary is confounded. The Institute's eccentric sponsor convenes a sEance in hope of discovering the truth. Can the victim return from beyond the grave to offer a clue to her own demise? And if she does, will she come alone?
