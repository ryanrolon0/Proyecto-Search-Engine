The Bold Frontiersman

 Smiling Jim is after the money Adam Post is collecting for a new reservoir. After Rocky breaks up his gang's attempted robbery. Jim steals the money himself, kills Harris, and gets the father and son to each believe the other did the killing. With Don confessing and scheduled to be hung, Rocky has a plan to trap Smiling Jim. Large sums of money have been collected from the ranchers in Cimarron Flats to build a much-needed water project. "Rocky" Lane, representing the construction company handling the job, arrives and finds the set-up tricky and dangerous. Honest and public-spirited rancher Adam Post is responsible for the money. But he has a son, Don, who is too fond of gambling, and the Sheriff, "Nugget" Clark is no match for the gang after the funds. "Smiling" Jack, owner of the gambling house, is the real brains behind the gang activity and plot to grab the money. It's his skill, also, with marked cards that has drawn Don Post into debts which make the project-fund a tempting way out of the heat the gang-leader has turned on him. "Rocky" has a tough fight on his hands---with the gunmen out to get him, with Don about to be hanged on a frame-up murder charge and a bold raid on the Post ranch's safe.
