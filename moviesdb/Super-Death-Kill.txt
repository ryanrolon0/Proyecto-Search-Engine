Super Death Kill

 Super Death Kill is a post-apocalyptic story about a mysterious hero from the wastelands (J. Michael Dones) who becomes trapped in a tournament where psychotic scavengers, monsters, and horrific creatures fight in a brutal contest to the death. The hero is driven to survive by the love of his girlfriend (Christina Gadberry-Pelley), and he is aided in this task by a fellow prisoner (Patrick O'Dowd). Running the show is the nefarious TV Man (Lloyd Kaufman), who has crafted the tournament into a profitable, futuristic gladiatorial event for thousands of subscribers. The rules of Super Death Kill are enforced by TV Man's deadly assassin "Bleach" (Charlie Carter)-a powerful killing machine with extraordinary fighting skills and menacing electric blades that he uses to dispatch his unfortunate victims. Michael's only chance for survival is to attempt the impossible and fight his way out-or die.
