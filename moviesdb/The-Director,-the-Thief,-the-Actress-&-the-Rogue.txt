The Director, the Thief, the Actress & the Rogue

 A thief and a kidnapper have their eyes on the goodies at Miranda's house - the thief wants Miranda's camera gear and the kidnapper covets Miranda's lovely friend, Veronica. Fortunately for the ladies, the crooks are so busy fighting each other, that the victims might be able to rescue themselves.
