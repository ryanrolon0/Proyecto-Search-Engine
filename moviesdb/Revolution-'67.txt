Revolution '67

 An illuminating account of events too often relegated to footnotes in U.S. history - the Black urban rebellions of the 1960's. Focusing on the six-day Newark, N.J. outbreak on July 12, 1967, the film reveals how the disturbance began as spontaneous revolts against poverty and police brutality and ended as fateful milestones in America's struggles over race and economic justice.
