Seattle in Color

 Seattle has been developed through various immigrant groups over the last century, whether from across the globe or from other corner of the United States. In 'Seattle In Color', four of these diverse transplants describe the reasons they landed in Seattle and what has kept them there since. Through statistics about the city's demographics and imagery of its eclectic neighborhoods, the film reveals the importance of a culture of diversity.
