President McKinley Inauguration

 The first sequence (ca. 49 ft.), views of President William McKinley speaks to the crowd during his inauguration in Washington, DC. We see crowds on Pennsylvania Ave., NW, passing by the Willard Hotel during the inauguration festivities. A military unit on horseback rides down the court of honor, the area on Pennsylvania Ave., NW, going down 15th to 17th streets. President and McKinley and his party reviews the inaugural parade from a stand here. McKinley tips his hat to the crowd as his carriage passes the Willard Hotel. Stting beside McKinley in the carriage is Sen. Marcus A. Hanna of Ohio with members of the President's special escort, Troop A of the Ohio National Guard, and aides aides with guards. The man riding alone in the second carriage is Vice President Theodore Roosevelt.
