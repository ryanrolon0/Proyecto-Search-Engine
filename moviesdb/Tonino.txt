Tonino

 Tonino is a clumsy Italian waiter in a pizza & pasta restaurant, heavily distracted by his ambitions as a photographer. One day he gets an assignment from his boss, pimp-like Joop Suede. He wants Tonino to photograph his wife, whom he suspects of adultery. When Tonino installs himself in the hotel lounge where Suede's wife is expected to have a secret date, a beautiful young woman enters the room and our hero gets to work.
