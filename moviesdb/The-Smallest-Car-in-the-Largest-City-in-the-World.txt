The Smallest Car in the Largest City in the World

 The Crown Prince Olav of Norway rides through the streets of London in a baby Cadillac, a present to him from his grandmother, Queen Alexandra of Great Britain. This newsreel begins with him leaving Cadillac headquarters in his miniature car. Next, he is shown in traffic at the Bank of England, Royal Exchange and Mansion House. Then he passes the National Gallery. Afterward, he visits Lord Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. Finally, Olav drives through the royal entrance of Marble Arch en route to Hyde Park. Next, a title card introduces Mona, age five, Tommy, age three, and Bobbles, who is one year old. They are the "royal testers." Mona drives the car through the countryside, as her two younger passengers enjoy the ride. They pass by a group of policemen. One of them gives chase on foot and finally catches them. He handcuffs the two older children together, wagging his finger censoriously. The last title card says, "Planning for the Future Generation." We see a tea party taking place outside. In the background is a table with the British flag and the American flag crossing each other. A sign says "100 Years of Peace." The small car is in the foreground with the two older children still in it.
