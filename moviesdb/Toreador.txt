Toreador

 Toreador is a humorous exploration of Escamillo; single, awkward and too old to be cruising bars in search of chicks. It is almost embarrassingly sad. Nevertheless, in his own eyes, he is a Greek God. Does he really believe that? Is he really that unaware? Who is he underneath all the bravado? Inside, our Escamillo is a shy and lonely man. Nevertheless, he is ever hopeful. Maybe this time he will find love. Unfolding like a palindrome of images, Toreador finds love in the strangest place, right in front of your nose.
