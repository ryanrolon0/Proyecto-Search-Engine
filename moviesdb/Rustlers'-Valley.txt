Rustlers' Valley

 Hoppy is the foreman on a ranch owned by Randall Glenn. Lawyer Cal Howard is trying to pressure Glenn into mortgaging his property, but Hoppy saves the ranch and gets the girl, Glenn's daughter. Lucky is falsely accused of robbing the local bank and assumed drowned in the river while being pursued by a posse. A grieving Hoppy takes exception to remarks made about his presumably dead young friend by local lawyer Cal Howard, and Hoppy knocks him down in public. Howard is engaged to Agnes, the pretty and personable daughter of local cattle rancher Glen Randall, who has borrowed heavily from the town bank in order to buy a herd of breed cattle. Howard's callously materialistic attitude toward his fiance, coupled with his virulent jealousy of Agnes' friendship with Hoppy, causes her to break off the engagement. The vindictive Howard pressures the bank to call in its loan on the Randall ranch and conspires to rustle the valuable herd, so that the Randall spread will fall into his hands. This is part of a larger covert plan by the avaricious lawyer to take over the entire valley on the behalf of a shadowy combine. A desperate Randall recruits Hoppy as his foreman to help him deal with the crisis and he immediately clashes with Howard. When Lucky turns up alive, he joins Hoppy and Windy in foiling the lawter's greedy plans. Lucky has been falsely accused of bank robbery. While Lucky hides from the law, Hoppy investigates and soon learns that Lawyer Howard is behind the robbery. Howard is after Glen Randall's ranch and has his stooge Taggert there as foreman. But Hoppy replaces Taggart as foreman and this leads to a showdown between the two sides.
