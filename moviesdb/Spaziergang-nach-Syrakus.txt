Spaziergang nach Syrakus

 Promenade to Syracuse is a film essay about a walking-tour in the footsteps of Johann Gottfried Seume's travel account from 1802. Originating from many months of walking - from the Swiss border down to Sicily, taking along a camera, a book and memory - Promenade to Syracuse grew to a film about the general and specific aspects of travels in which one hopes to encounter the unexpected.
