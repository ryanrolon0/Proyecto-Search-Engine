They Came from Beyond Space

 Astronomers investigate a mysterious meteorite shower in a rural English farm field, - exceptional because the space rocks all fell in a V formation. Dr. Richard Arden, preeminent in the field of extraterrestrial study, is not permitted to accompany his colleagues, including his girlfriend Lee Mason, because he is still recovering from the effects of a recent motor accident. The scientists are summarily taken over by some alien force, and others in the area are dying from a mysterious "crimson plague," which covers their bodies with drops of blood. Temple seems the only person immune to both maladies, so if he can discover the reason for this immunity, he may yet foil the alien plan to take earthlings back to the moon for their own sinister purposes. Aliens crash land on the moon, they try to use scientists from earth as slaves to to help fix their ship. But one of the scientists has a metal plate in his head and he cannot be controlled by the Aliens. Based on the Novel "The Gods Hate Kansas". In a plot similar to the made-for-TV movie "Night Slaves", aliens take over the bodies of Earthlings and transport them to the moon to be used as slave labor. Hero Curt Temple is immune to the aliens' influence, thanks to a silver plate in his head he received courtesy of an auto accident.
