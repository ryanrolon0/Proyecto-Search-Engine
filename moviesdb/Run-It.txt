Run It

 On a perfect day Manny and Franky dump the body, pay the Barber, and collect from Bobbo, Andrew rescues his dying grandfather, and Jermain runs away from home with his little sister. But on this day, as their lives collide in violent crimes, and this unusual group starts to feel connected; each one slowly understands that one Man's gain is another's loss until there is nothing left.
