Raven's Cravings

 Veronica Cammano is leading a double life. By day she endures corporate life as the winner of the prestigious Lockhorne Internship, where she suffers insults and indignation from her condescending boss, Mark Manley. But when darkness falls, Veronica transforms into Mistress Raven, dungeon master of the city's hottest S&M club. When Manley's obnoxious attitude becomes unbearable, Veronica escapes by fantasizing about a "slow, prolonged, intensely painful revenge." Mistress Raven has a craving to meet Mark Manley and cause Veronica's two worlds to collide.
