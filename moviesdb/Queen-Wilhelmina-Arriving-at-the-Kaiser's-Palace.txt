Queen Wilhelmina Arriving at the Kaiser's Palace

 A beautiful picture taken at the main entrance to the Kaiser's Palace. A large number of carriages drive up and their celebrated occupants alight and pass into the palace. Count Von Bulow and Field Marshall Count Von Waldersee are in attendance at the palace door. Finally the carriage containing Queen Wilhelmina and the Prince Consort arrives, drawn by six splendid horses. The very popular little Dutch Queen is met by the Kaiser as she passes into the palace. The Kaiser reverently kisses her hand. The picture is closed by Queen Wilhelmina and the Prince Consort taking leave of the Kaiser after having finished their visit.
