TouchE and Go

 On the French Riviera, a dog chases a female cat under a street-painter's wagon, which paints a white stripe on the cat's back. Pepe Le Pew, the amorous French skunk, sees the female cat and thinks she's a girl skunk. She cannot bear his foul scent and runs away, resulting in an underwater chase.
