Verdict

 A look at the cases of four innocent mostly middle-class Americans who were wrongfully accused by the police, and subsequently convicted of committing major crimes, including murder, armed robbery, and rape. Each of the four individuals has now been completely exonerated; although one of them died of a heart attack at 32 years of age before he could prove his innocence, and another spent over a third of his life in prison before being released. Remarkably, following its broadcast, this documentary was instrumental in helping two of the individuals prove their innocence and win their release from prison.
