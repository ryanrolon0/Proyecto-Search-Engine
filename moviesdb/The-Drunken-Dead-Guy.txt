The Drunken Dead Guy

 This is the story of Tom, an advertising contractor with an empty, gray existence, as cold as his commute to work through the concrete. After an untimely death, he enjoys the comforts of Heaven, but a wrongly perceived crises (God doesn't understand that the Devils are a hockey team)results in the need for a miracle. Tom is the unlucky choice to be risen up to fight the Devils. Unfortunately, Heaven botches the job and Tom is a rotting corpse. The only solution is for him to drink a lot of alcohol to preserve himself. The side effect is that he gets intoxicated!
