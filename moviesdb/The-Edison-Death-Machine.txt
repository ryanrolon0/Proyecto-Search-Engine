The Edison Death Machine

 Thought only to exist in legend, Edison's device for contacting the dead is found...and stolen. A group of professional thieves go on a global crime spree reanimating the dead in order to steal treasures thought long lost. Things begin to go wrong when they cannot control the creatures, and the machine begins to develop a mind of its own.
