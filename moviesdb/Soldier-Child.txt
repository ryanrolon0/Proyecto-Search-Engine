Soldier Child

 A documentary filmed in Northern Uganda about a religious fanatic named Joseph Kony who abducts, then brainwashes children turning then into "child soldiers." Since 1990, Kony has kidnapped more than 12,000 children and forced them to commit unspeakable atrocities against their families and communities. This film is about the efforts of the Ugandan people to rehabilitate these children and reintroduce them into society.
