The Quiet Place

 Based on the Rebecca Kennebeck poem "Her Soul Flies Free," THE QUIET PLACE essays the emotional downward spiral of Hope, who frequently retreats to her own imaginary world to escape the torment of a recent personal tragedy. As she continues to fill the void inside her with darkness, the venomous misery that courses through her veins threatens to destroy her life, both in this world and in the imaginary world that she so desperately clings to.
