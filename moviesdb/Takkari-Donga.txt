Takkari Donga

 Raja is a small-time outlaw, whose daring antics land him the accidental job of designated bodyguard to Bhuvana. Bhuvana is being chased by an gang led by Shaka, who are after a map leading to a hidden diamond mine. Nicely shot, otherwise standard action fare - and interesting experience for anyone who's never heard that India once had a wild wild west. More likely though that fans of Bipasha Basu and Lisa Ray will be thrilled at this film, where they more than fulfill their roles as showpieces.
