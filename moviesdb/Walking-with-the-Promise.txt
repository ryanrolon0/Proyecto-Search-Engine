Walking with the Promise

 Walking with the Promise is an inspirational video that brings to life a series of original paintings that depict Jesus Christ's emotional walk to Calvary. Based on the 'Stations of the Cross' or the 'Way of the Cross', these beautiful images, along with incredibly moving voice acting performances and a musical score second to none, take us through the story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection with a feeling and understanding like never before. Experiencing the Lord's journey in this way allows us to feel God's promise with gratitude, hope, and joy.
