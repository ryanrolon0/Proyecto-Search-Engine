The Grandparents

 When nostalgia meet reality... watch out! Adam and Cindy's plan for a lovely trip to the country to visit his grandparents is quickly derailed when they witness grandma shoving her lover out the side door as they approach the farmhouse. Grandpa provides no tension relief either, as we learn he has given up traditional farming for a more profitable horticultural undertaking - growing weed. A surreal before dinner drinks scene unfolds as dirty laundry is aired, tempers flare and Cindy barely escapes with a butt cheek full of rock salt and her wedding plans definitely called off.
