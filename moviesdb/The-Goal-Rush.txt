The Goal Rush

 The football teams from Canine College and Alley Cat College are playing in their annual Milk Bowl game. A dachshund (dash-hound) makes a long run for a touchdown, and the Cat's quarterback tosses a pass for a score, and the game is tied at halftime. While the teams are resting, a follow-the-bouncing ball audience participation singalong breaks out, and the famous fight songs from several real American colleges are played. (Those songs didn't include "Buckle Down, Winsocki" which would have been a natural even if Winsoki was fictional.) The second half remains tied until the Canines use mechanical mice to confuse the Cats, and then use a backfield shift that converts to a steamroller, and they steam-roll their way down the field to the winning score.
