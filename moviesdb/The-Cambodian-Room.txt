The Cambodian Room

 Antoine D'Agata, a Magnum photographer, is in Phom Penh (Cambodia) where his artistic trail seems to reach an utmost point. After devoting his art to picture desolated landscapes and borderline realities, Antoine D'Agata focuses his art on his intimate human relations. His latest work concentrates on body and flesh, in a narrow room. This film catches the hidden part of his art making; his choice of living at edges and living sex as extreme vitalism.
