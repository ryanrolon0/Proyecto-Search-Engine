Second Honeymoon

 Second Honeymoon works on two levels; it is the story of George and Irene, an elderly couple revisiting their honeymoon fifty years later. It is a personal trip through their memories of young love, providing a personal insight into their relationship and the tenderness which unites them and burns brightly into their twilight years. It is also a film which documents bereavement; George is man in a deep state of shock because his beloved wife has died. He attempts to find solace and understanding by going on a trip and he takes Irene with him, in memory and in presence, to relive the moments from their past, check their togetherness and to find resolution in the fact that she will always be with him.
