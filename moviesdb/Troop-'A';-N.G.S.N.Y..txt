Troop 'A'; N.G.S.N.Y.

 "This is New York City's crack cavalry troop, and is composed largely of wealthy young men who own their own horses and equipments. In this picture, however, they have left their parade accoutrements behind, and appear very soldierly as they come down Fifth Avenue in campaign uniform on their way to the front."
