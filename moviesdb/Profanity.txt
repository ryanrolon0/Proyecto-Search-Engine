Profanity

 In an age of lawlessness, where respect and humility are long buried in the past, three men decide to reclaim their streets. In their bid to exhume long forgotten values and serve their revenge, Scott Wright (Coronation Street, Shameless), Leon Lopez (Brookside, Hollyoaks In the City) and Dane Brookes (Braincell) take one captive each to a desolate cavern. One by one, they unmask their captives and reveal their motives, but there is a horrific surprise in store. This tense drama is of interest to anyone that has ever felt let down by the judicial system and, for just one split second, considered doing something about it.
