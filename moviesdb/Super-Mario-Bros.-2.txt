Super Mario Bros. 2

 Long after the previous battle with King Bowser Koopa, the Mushroom Kingdom was safe again. Mario went to sleep one night and had a strange dream Luigi, Toad, and Princess arrived in this strange world called Subcon, filled with strange beings, like snakes that spit bullets, walking cactuses, and birds that drop bombs. Also, the land is ruled by the mean Wart, a mutant lizard who hates vegetables, so once again Mario and Luigi with Toad and Princess must stop evil, where ever it is lurking lands, in the woods, high in the sky, in caverns, in magic doors and then come face to face with Wart. This is not an easy mission, but then again it's all just a dream...Or is it?
