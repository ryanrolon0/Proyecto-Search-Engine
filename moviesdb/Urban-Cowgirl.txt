Urban Cowgirl

 When Ben Evans arranges an interview at an Equestrian Center, his 14 year old daughter Jorgie must prove herself not only to the daunting hunter-jumper trainer, Susana, but to Susana's riding students, the very same scornful, self-important It Girls who make Jorgie's life miserable at school. Rising to the Trainer's challenge, Jorgie matches wits with Stella, a cagey old show horse who puts the girl through her paces. Her efforts draw the attention of handsome, 16 year old Zando, further inflaming the It Girls animosity.
