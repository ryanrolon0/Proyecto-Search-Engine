Sun City Picture House

 Sun City Picture House is the story of Rapheal Louigene a young Haitian man who loves movies. After watching the last of the old colonial movie theaters destroyed in the earthquake he enlists the help of a priest and two young aid workers to build Haiti's only movie theater on a hill above a tent city. The community rallies behind and all pitch in to work, sometimes through the night for four days and through a tropical storm to open on time. Sun City Picture House is a joyful and moving story of a community torn apart by disaster then united in a singular vision of bringing back cinema to a country destroyed.
