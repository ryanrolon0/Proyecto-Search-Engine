Surface to Air

 Jane Pepper goes off her meds to spark the lighthearted romp she wants to script. She follows her psychotic muse on the road, across the Southwest, to experience firsthand the bloody crime scenes of an active, real-life serial killer ludicrously instrumental to her grisly 'romantic comedy.' Haunted by her husband's death, the female critic she stalks for panning her last novel, and the orderly who introduced her to a crawlspace of the 'loony bin' her parents once put her in, Jane loses sight of the task at hand as the looming presence of her own denouement fades out everything.
