Prime Target

 John Bloodstone is a cop who is put on suspension after he uses a blow torch to stop a group of hostage takers. Bloodstone's next assignment begins when his boss, Commissioner Garth, calls him in and introduces him to FBI agent Harrington, and Garth and Harrington assign Bloodstone to transport a mob informant named Marrietta Copella to a new location. Soon after Bloodstone picks Copella up, Bloodstone and Coppella figure out that Garth and Harrington have set them both up to be killed, because Garth and Harrington are afraid Copella will mention their names in his testimony, and Garth thinks Bloodstone is too dangerous and nosy to keep on the force anymore. What Garth and Harrington have forgotten is that Bloodstone carries a pistol that is capable of blowing basketball sized holes into people.
