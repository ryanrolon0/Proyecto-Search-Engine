STIFF 2006 Weekend Film Challenge

 On Friday May 12th, 20 of the hottest filmmaking teams in Seattle gathered to draw a genre, prop, character and punch line out of a hat. They then had one weekend to complete a short film using these elements. What they came up with, is nothing short of extraordinary. The teams were duking it out for Audience Domination and a huge prize from Victory Studios. But, the Weekend Film Challenge is much more than just a contest, it is a co-op filmmaking project. This DVD contains the blood, sweat and tears of the area's best and brightest independent filmmakers. You haven't seen the last from these folks.
