The Thirteenth Day

 Aired as a one-hour special on ABC-TV, this drama told the Old Testament story of a young queen who had to defend both herself and her people after a power-mad advisor convinces her husband that she must die. The story had Jewish girl Esther marrying King Ahasuerus, whose minister Haman tried to kill him. The plot was thwarted by a Jew. To get revenge, Haman convinces the king that the Jews are a threat to his throne, although neither man knows that beautiful young Esther is also Jewish. Since the king's order to kill her people cannot be reversed, the queen has to find a way to save her people and at the same time reveal to the king the true nature of the treacherous Haman. A well-done television drama, the program's familiar plot line had been used before for the features QUEEN ESTHER and ESTHER AND THE KING.
