Trysting

 How many ways can an evening go wrong between two people getting to know each other? Six couples either on first dates or meeting in a bar sort out their feelings. One pair seems compatible, ordering similar food and finishing each other's sentences. A solitary guy works on his lines in front of a mirror before a colleague from work arrives at his flat for dinner. A woman two years out of college with two brothers and a sister starts a non-stop monologue befogging her date. A hungry woman waits for a man to return from the restroom, as she eyes both their dinners. Two silent strangers avoid eye contact next to each other at a bar. Does anyone have it right?
