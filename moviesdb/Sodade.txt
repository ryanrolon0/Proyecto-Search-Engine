Sodade

 A beautiful white horse that has frilled circus' goers for years, stumbles and falls during one evening's performance. The circus manager decides it's time to sell the animal for horsemeat to the butcher. A mime violinist who is emotionally attached to the horse, raises enough money from friends to buy it back. The violinist leads the horse to its native land in Camargue where he sets the animal free. This moving fable, reminiscent of the silent era, follows the voyage home of man and horse and their unique friendship.
