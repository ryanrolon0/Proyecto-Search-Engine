The Peace Treaty of Portsmouth

 In 1905 the United States hosted a peace conference in Portsmouth, New Hampshire that led to a peace treaty which ended the war between Russia and Japan. The treaty led to a Nobel Peace Prize for President Teddy Roosevelt. This documentary focuses on people, who worked from a spiritual/religious perspective on behalf of peace. It includes activities from the 2005 100th anniversary celebration which took on a life of its own. Finally, it suggests what this means to us today.
