Three Shots

 Three Shots is a magical anthology of three tales focusing on a family-owned tavern in Chicago at three different periods in the establishment's history. First...1978, and the story of two brothers who must face a tragic realization. We then are transported to the present and a woman's comic tale of mortality and commitment. And finally, to the point in history where it all began, one very momentous day in 1943, when lives for generations would be forever changed.
