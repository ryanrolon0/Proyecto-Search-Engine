Shanghai

 Jakob Montrasio created this 20-minute video odyssey of Shanghai's streets and highways. The film was shot from a bus deck and the sidecar of a Changjiang Motor Bike. The extraordinary floating quality of the film was achieved with an arm extension and stabilizer through a car's sunroof as he documented the street life and changing architecture of Shanghai's vibrant and diverse neighborhoods.
