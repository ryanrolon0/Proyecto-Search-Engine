Saint Patrick vs. The Southside

 After being away from Earth for more than 1,500 years, Saint Patrick has returned and is shocked to find that drinking is going on in his name at Chicago's 2009 South Side Irish Parade! The poor old guy might have been able to drive the snakes out of Ireland but that was nothing compared to the task of trying to get 340,000 Chicagoans to give up the drink. And to add insult to injury, for some reason everybody thinks St. Paddy is the pope....or Moses.
