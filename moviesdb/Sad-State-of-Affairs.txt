Sad State of Affairs

 Amongst an unknown city and indiscernible time, three friends paid to commit murder travel to their last job together. Michael, the individual responsible for the disbandment of the group, is disheartened and desires to start a family. To the dismay of Vincent and Aidan, whose motives remain fame and fortune, an agreement will only be reached after the final body is accounted for.
