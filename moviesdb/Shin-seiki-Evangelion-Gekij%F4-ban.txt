Shin seiki Evangelion Gekijô-ban

 The Evangelion saga from TV is artfully recounted, with some additional scenes, in part one see immediately afterward, where the NERV organization has outlived its usefulness. The shadowy covenant of SEELE launches an all-out commando assault against the ill-defended headquarters. Asuka, semi-comatose, is placed in her EVA for safety, while Misato and company struggle to find Shinji and Rei before they're assasinated by SEELE's forces.
