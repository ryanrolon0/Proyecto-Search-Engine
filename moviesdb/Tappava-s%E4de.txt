Tappava säde

 One day Säde Vasara, counselor at a women's domestic violence shelter in Espoo, Finland, has had enough of their lenient attitude towards the men whose victims they take care of. Even in repeated cases that only get worse each time, they normally won't report anyone to the police. While visiting a family's empty home to pick up stuff for the woman and children in their custody, she is tempted to tamper with the razor cord in the bathroom to realise her first act of revenge. Living alone with her cat, she starts seeing a new neighbour, well-mannered Kalle who's just been released from prison after killing his violent father years earlier. Now she has a soul mate, but she's too shy to confide in him until he too is deeply linked into her plot in an unexpected manner. Maybe better that way...
