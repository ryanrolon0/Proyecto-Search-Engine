 Nathan Glenmore wants to be a rock star. Unfortunately, he has no talent. He enters a contest at his high school for "America's Next Big Star." The record label executives responsible for the contest choose Nathan as a bet to see if they can turn a "no-talent" teenager into a star. Nathan's life is changed forever, as well as the lives of those involved with the "bet."
