Smoke Signal

 Capt. Harper's cavalry patrol returns to the fort to find it besieged by Ute Indians. The apparent cause is the recapture of Army traitor Brett Halliday, who deserted to the Utes in a previous war; but Brett has a different story. With capture imminent, the only chance for the surviving men (and one woman) is to boat down a wild, uncharted river, where Harper and Halliday must pull together, like it or not. In New Mexico Territory in 1852 a small detachment of cavalry replacement troops ride into their new post on the Colorado River and find it being attacked by Ute Indians. Only nine of the original complement survive, including the slain commanding officer's daughter, Laura Evans ('Piper Laurie' (qv)); the new commander, arrogant Lieutenant Wayne Ford ('Rex Reason' (qv)0, and prisoner Brett Halliday ('Dana Andrews (I)' (qv)), a renegade soldier who deserted his command two years previously to join the Ute, who he thought were being mistreated. Captain Harper ('William Talman' (qv)),realizing the Ute will strike again, wants to escape overland, but Halliday knows Indian customs, and advises in favor of taking flatboats down the river.
