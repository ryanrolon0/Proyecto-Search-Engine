Tage mit Waschmaschinen

 A winter long Mr. Jona meets his young neighbor Lene constantly in the basement - washroom of their apartment building. Mr. Jona's primary occupation is living as a bored husband. Being the daughter of a fallen female star pianist, untalented Lene lives under the certain pressure of not disappointing her mother. A few hours a day, together in between buzzing washing machines,the strange basement-couple tries to calm down from their lonesome everyday-existences. They mark their time together.
