Tales of a Fly on the Wall

 The expression uttered mischievously throughout the world, "If only I were a fly on the wall" is personified in this truly original, hilariously irreverent, scripted, anthology comedy. Starring THE FLY, a seedily Shakespearean, two-winged Big Brother, this quick-witted, acid-tongued tour guide invites us into his world, to become 'A Fly on the Wall'. As the show's eavesdropping Host, THE FLY opens his personal diary, to divulge all of the deviant, embarrassing, confidential naughtiness everyone believed they could conceal. It's the most tantalizing "tell all" of all time. Do you think your secrets are safe from prying eyes? Well think again, 'cause he's The Fly on the Wall. Dzzzzzt!
