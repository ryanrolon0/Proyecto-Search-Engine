The Stoneman

 In the small Rocky Mountain community of Telluride, Colorado, USA, a homeless stone mason organizes local musicians to produce a successful record album. Now in production of his first film and second album, he has drawn the support of Shawn Colvin, nine time Grammy winner, Emmylou Harris, and Academy award winning producer Bobby Houston.
