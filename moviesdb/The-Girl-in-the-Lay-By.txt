The Girl in the Lay-By

 In the gray, wet weather of the Scottish highlands near Inverness, Coll works at a roadside stall selling tea and biscuits. She dreams of seeing New York and the world, a dream her boss derides. A daily customer is Old Tom, who's across the way digging a grave next to that of his wife, Annie. One day, Coll finds something Tom's lost, and he tells her about Annie's life as a dancer. "You take your chance or it's gone," he observes. What will Coll do with this wisdom?
