The Rut

 After a life-shattering event, an outdoorsy, 14 year-old girl disappears into the forest for days. Skillfully surviving the elements and wildlife attacks alone, she wins a national competition in honor of her father by slaying his lifetime quest deer and manages to also save a life in the process.
