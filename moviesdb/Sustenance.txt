Sustenance

 Gerry and Leslie are working their way through life, one day at a time. They do nothing and go nowhere. Why do you think they moved to Bournemouth - land of the living dead. The day started like any other. They woke, they ate, they watched TV... occasionally they daydream. Then, the landlord arrived. Threatened with eviction, they agreed to deliver a dubious package. What ensues is a comedy of farcical elements that has them encountering obsessed transsexuals, man-sized cakes, extortionate Taxi Drives and hunger pains from the mornings breakfast pizza. Arriving back at the flat they realize it was all a ruse to get them out of their property. With their psychotic landlord having a perverse wild orgy in their kitchen they decide the time has come to... go to McDonalds.
