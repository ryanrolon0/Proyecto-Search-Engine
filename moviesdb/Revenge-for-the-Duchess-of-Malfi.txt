Revenge for the Duchess of Malfi

 This chilling film-noir retelling of John Webster's 'The Duchess of Malfi' (itself inspired by actual events), peers into the life of the recently widowed Duchess of Malfi, who belongs to a family of "business." Her jealous brother Ferdinand prohibits her from remarrying, and hires Bosola, a hit-man, to keep an eye on her. The Duchess marries an accountant named Antonio in secret and Ferdinand, in way of retaliation, commands Bosola to torture her psychologically. As the tortures become more and more violent, Bosola finds that his conscience grows louder and louder and he vows to do whatever it takes to make right his past. Even if it means murder.
