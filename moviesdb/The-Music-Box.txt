The Music Box

 In a New York City apartment, a little girl is trying to open an antique wooden box. Unfortunately the box is stuck, but the little girl has an idea. Thru a series of shots we become to realize that the little girl is building something quite elaborate. Finally a toy robot is placed and set to start walking, initiating a sequence of mechanical interactions that travel across the room. The cause and effect series eventually culminates with a string that pulls open the lid of the box revealing a spinning ballerina set to music.
