The American Soldier in Love and War

 These three scenes are to be used in connection with two war views to make a complete story in one film for projection. The first scene shows the young American officer parting with his sweetheart and starting for the Philippines. The second shows the regiment leaving its post to embark in the transport. Then comes a fight in the brush, then the wounding of the young officer; his capture and rescue by a Filipino girl and finally his meeting with his sweetheart and her father in the Filipino hut where he has been nursed back to life.
