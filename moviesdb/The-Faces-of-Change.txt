The Faces of Change

 In 1958, children ages 6 to 17 years old walked into a restaurant, sat down and asked for cokes. They were refused service for one reason and one reason only, the color of their skin. Still, for nearly six years, these children, month after month, year after year politely continued their efforts. Armed only with their understanding of the U.S. Constitution, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s teachings on peaceful action and their determination, they turned Jim Crow laws around, restaurant by restaurant. Fifty years later, the children of the civil rights movement weave together their modern day lives with the past in a beautifully uplifting documentary film The Faces of Change.
