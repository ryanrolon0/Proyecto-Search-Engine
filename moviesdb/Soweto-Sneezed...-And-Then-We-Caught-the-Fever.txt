Soweto Sneezed... And Then We Caught the Fever

 This documentary short takes a look at the student riots and political unrest in Cape Town in 1976 and the 1980's, as response to the Apartheid government's 'Bantu Education' act. Through interviews with community members, students and teachers at the time, as well as archival news footage the documentary explores how community members fought the struggle for justice and equality.
