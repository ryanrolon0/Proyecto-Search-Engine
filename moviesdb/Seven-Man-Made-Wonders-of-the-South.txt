Seven Man Made Wonders of the South

 Being a little over 18 miles from the continent is both a godsend and a curse. Over the centuries, trade with Europe has been easy, unfortunately with proximity brings the threat of invasion.

Chris Packham explores the Seven Man-made Wonders of The South aboard a 150 year old sailing ship, a bicycle, a narrow boat and a New Forest Pony.
