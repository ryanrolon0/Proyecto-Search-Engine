The Recycled History of Recycling

 Taking 'reduce, re-use and recycle' as its mantra, this innovative short film tells the story of recycling using 100% recycled footage. The cyclical story goes from the necessity that drove the 'make do and mend' culture of WW2 through the consumer boom of the 50's, the emergence of the green movement in the 70's, the throwaway culture of the 80's and 90's and on to the challenges of scarce resources and the growing eco-consciousness of the new millennium.
