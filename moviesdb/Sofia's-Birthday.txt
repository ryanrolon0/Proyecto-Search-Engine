Sofia's Birthday

 After her Father recently passed away, Sofia must experience her first birthday without him. On all her past birthdays, she has spent the day in the park with her Father. Comforted by her widowed Mother but cynical in understanding, Sofia insists she will take his ashes to the park anyway. She will walk through the fields, by the trees, all the way down to the dock... And then she's going to drown his ashes in the lake.
