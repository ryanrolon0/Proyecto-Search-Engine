Textual @traction

 When walking in the hills to take pictures, Tom gets a text from his girlfriend that distracts him and sees him fall down a steep slope. He is taken to hospital for a long recovery but nobody can find out who to contact - his girlfriend worries. Tom's phone is found by a young man who lives in the hills and struggles with his homosexuality as a result. When he finds the phone he carries on the text flirting, thinking it is a guy that is interested in him. With so much confusion, could everything work out in the end?
