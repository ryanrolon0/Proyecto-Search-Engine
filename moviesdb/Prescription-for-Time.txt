 Geraldine (Gaye Saunders), an elderly woman, suffers from early signs of dementia and fears losing her independence to her daughter. In an attempt to change her fate, she finds hope in a drug that promises to extend life. Now caught in a crossroad between fear and hope, Geraldine must find the courage to face the truth of her reality or watch her life spin dangerously out of control.
