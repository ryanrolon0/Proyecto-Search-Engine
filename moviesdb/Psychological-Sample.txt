Psychological Sample

 Psychological Sample follows the experience of Michael Heffernan, an everyman, who decides to respond to a seemingly harmless survey advertisement. Rather than an easy participation fee as promised in the ad, Michael finds himself the victim of what appears to be a twisted prank or a nightmare of bureaucratic nonsense. Soon, Michael is forced to reject any ideas of professionalism and can only hope to escape this epitome of mindless protocol. Psychological Sample is a comedy of mind-bending proportions, best enjoyed when it isn't happening to you!
