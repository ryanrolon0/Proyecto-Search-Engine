The End of the Affair

 In an otherwise deserted meadow, a man has set up a table with two chairs, glasses and a bottle of wine. A woman arrives on a bicycle. They sit across from each other, he pours the wine, and she breaks off their affair. After several minutes of exchanging every clichE in the book, they agree to have one last drink and play the game one more time. Who they are and the game they play is slowly revealed.
