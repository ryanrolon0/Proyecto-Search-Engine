Royal Heritage

 A preview of the (then) upcoming coronation ceremony for Queen Elizabeth II. It explains how the young queen is carrying on a tradition unbroken in 250 years by the British sovereignty, from George I. It shows how the new Queen is a descendant from the first Sruart and the first Tudor, down the line to Charlemagne. Historical places in London, in connection with the ceremony, are shown along with the personages involved. The commentary is spoken by Robert Donat, with music written by William Alwyn and played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
