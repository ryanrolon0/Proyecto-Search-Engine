Traces of a City

 A documentary about an interesting peace movement occurring in the heart of the City of Peace painstakingly reconstructing the city that they remember from their childhood before it was destroyed by the Atomic-bomb. The group is headed by documentary film director Maasaki Tanabe who as a child lived directly next to the Industrial Promotion Hall, now A-bomb Dome - the last standing structure in Hiroshima from before the Atomic Bomb. With the help of modern Computer Graphics and experts the group is able to see the old city that they miss and love. Through laughter and tears and all the emotions in between they are able to be children once again. And in their nostalgia they are also able to send a message of peace - gently reminding the world about the pain and loss involved with war - in hopes that these actions are never repeated.
