The Chief

 Monte Bettogli, Carrara mountain. Il Capo (The Chief) manages, coordinates and guides quarrymen and heavyduty machines using a language consisting solely of gestures and signs. Conducting his dangerous and sublime orchestra against the backdrop of the sheer slopes and peaks of the Apuane Alps, the Chief works in total noise, which creates a paradoxical silence.
