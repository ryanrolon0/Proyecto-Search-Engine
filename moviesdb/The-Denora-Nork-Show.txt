The Denora Nork Show

 She's a small town girl following her dreams of being a Hollywood starlet as she doles out misguided advice to those who dare follow in her footsteps. What could possibly be so hard for Denora Nork in La La Land? Debbie Bledsoe stars as the quirky starlet in training in this unflinching and unscripted comedy, with Jon McMahand as Ned the cameraman, Julia Milova as Samantha the neighbor, and Baxter the six-pound Yorkie as Butterfly.
