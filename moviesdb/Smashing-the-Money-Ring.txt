Smashing the Money Ring

 The prison print ship is making counterfeit $10's and $20's and shipping them outside to Dice. He then goes aboard the gambling ship 'Kismet' and exchanges his bills for real money. But Steve Parker does not like this and gets himself arrested and Dice captured by the cops. But the phoney money has been spotted by the Feds and Brass is put into the prison population to see if he can get Dice to talk. It is up to Brass to find out where the bogus bills are being printed and who is behind it. In the third of a four film series, Secret Service agent "Brass" Bancroft, is assigned to uncover a counterfeiting ring that operates inside the walls of the state prison. "Dice" Matthews, former convict and the ring's 'outside man' decides to distribute the the counterfeit bills from a gambling ship anchored outside the three-mile-limit. Bancroft and his assistant, "Gabby" Watters, pick up the trail from there, and then Bancroft goes undercover in the prison, as a convict, to land the ringleader.
