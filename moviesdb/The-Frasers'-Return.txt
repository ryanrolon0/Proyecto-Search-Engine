The Frasers' Return

 When the Frasers left Scotland for Canada more than a decade ago, the country looked almost like an underdeveloped country. Now this is 1963 and their native place has modernized itself and, thanks to the South of Scotland Electricity Board, things have changed tremendously. This is what the Fraser family realizes, as they visit both the places of interest and the power stations of the region.
