Small Town Secrets

 Filmmaker Katherine Leggett talks to each of her parents, Ellen and Mark, in separate phone conversations about their marriage to each other and their separation, after which each took a new partner. Ellen and her two children moved into a duplex in Stoughton, Wisconsin, next door to Ellen's love, Margot, and her four children. Ellen talks about being in love and being in the closet, wanting to protect her children from outside opinion. Mark had his own secret life, and he later comes out to his children and introduces them to Jim. Mark asks Katherine is she still has any pain. Archival photos and home movies punctuate adult reflection with small-town images of children at play.
