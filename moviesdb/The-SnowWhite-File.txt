The SnowWhite File

 The SnowWhite File is a musical film with a twist, shedding a new light onto the beloved story of SnowWhite. Somewhere in a long-forgotten corner of the Magic Archives a young magician discovers a secret file revealing the truth about the fairy tale. As it turns out the story, as we have known it, was actually a cover-up and the Wicked Queen nothing but the victim of a devious plot. But she certainly deserved what she got.
