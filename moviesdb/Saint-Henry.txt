Saint Henry

 Henry and Twiggy, two gender-bending delinquents break into a church and hide-out from the police for a night. While there they discover the dead body of a homeless man in the confessional, and Henry, a tom-boy with absent-father issues spends the night trying to make some sense out of the loss of this complete stranger.
