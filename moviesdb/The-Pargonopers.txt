The Pargonopers

 February 8th. Up at 5 am to work on the new novel. It shall be called "The Pargonopers.." And so begins thirteen extraordinary days in the life of the most reticulate and complex novel the form has ever known. "The Pargonopers" is an affectionate satire of the literary life and its tendency towards eccentricity and self-absorption.
