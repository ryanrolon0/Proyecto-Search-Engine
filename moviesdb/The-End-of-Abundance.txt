The End of Abundance

 In the fall of 2005, two young Canadian filmmakers traveled to the Indian state of Punjab, renowned throughout the country as the nation's bread basket. One time poster boy of the 'Green Revolution', three decades of industrial agriculture have left the once profoundly fertile region an epicenter of ecological crises, poverty and collapsing productivity, concerns that spread far beyond the small state's borders to the hundreds of millions that depend on its grain exports. Centered on the reflections of one farmer and student in the village of Talwandi Kalan, this short documentary and travelogue explores an unfolding tragedy of epic proportions.
