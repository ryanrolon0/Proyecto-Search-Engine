The Tia Juana Kid

 A third version of "Irish Gringo" and "Call of the Coyote" in which a robin-hood type bandit, El Capitan, and his two companions, Pancho and Pedro, rescue an orphan (a boy this time) from the clutches of an outlaw gang, who are after the treasure map, drawn on his chest by his grandfather, before he was murdered. El Capitan, and his two companions, show an "unusual" amount of interest in the boy, beyond protecting him from the outlaw gang.
