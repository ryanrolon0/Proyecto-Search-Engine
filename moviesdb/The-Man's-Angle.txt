The Man's Angle

 A lecturer on domestic difficulties, having previously discussed the subject from a woman's viewpoint, now proceeds to present the man's perspective. He emphasizes that he wishes to avoid generalizations that would apply to all women. Instead, he plans to present a series of sketches that illustrate possibly isolated examples of some of the ways that particular women have baffled or frustrated their husbands by their behavior.
