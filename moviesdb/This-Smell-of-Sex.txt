This Smell of Sex

 «My friends in Beirut freely recount their most secret, ardent and obsessive sexual experiences, in minute detail», confides Danielle Arbid, a filmmaker who has already won numerous prizes at Locarno. Archival footage of prim young girls alternates with darkened shots of men and women discussing their formative experiences and their fantasies. Their words and the visual representations create a highly poetic erotic tension.
