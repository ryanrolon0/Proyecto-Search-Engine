The Basement

 Sabine is an out of work actress in her forties, living with a man ten years her junior, Jake. She is suffering from migraines. When she is alone in the house, she hears noises coming from downstairs. Sabine tells Jake that she has seen a ghost but he doesn't believe her and they argue. When the noise starts up again, late that night, they both go down to the basement. What they discover is shocking and life changing.
