The Girls of Godiva High

 The Good girls of GODIVA HIGH, opens in the girls gymnasium when we are introduced to a lovely set of young ladies. Then we are introduced to the problems inherent in any modern education. While scanning Playgirl, our young heroines are discussing the doing away with the conservative band and instituting a new tradition at Godiva High; a Disco Party. But how to convince Miss Lena, the headmistress? The school psychologist lets them know how(wink)! Through one of the boys who just happens to be her gardener. Convincing her is not "hard". Our heroine, Kitsy directs her girls in the fine art of extricating what is needed , from the men & boys, to make this "Graduation Disco Party" one of the best memories of the young girls lives. Super Hot!
