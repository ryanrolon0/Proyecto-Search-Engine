Streeters

 On any given night in the greater Salt Lake City area, there are over 1,000 homeless youth. Most recorded cases of youth homelessness are due to abuse, mental illness, aging out of foster care, and sexual orientation. Until recently, it was deemed illegal to host a youth shelter in Utah, and currently no youth shelter is underway. Because of this, each day these young people are faced with obstacles such as finding shelter and food. Some of these youth are attempting to get off the streets, while others have become accustomed to street culture and that way of life. These youth are constantly in motion, moving from place to place in hopes of finding some form of stability.
