 Over the past 30 years, disasters - storms, floods and droughts - have increased threefold, according to the UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. When extreme weather strikes, the poor are usually hit hardest. Tropical storms, floods and droughts account for 75 percent of all disasters. Disaster relief agencies try to pick up the pieces. But increasingly, governments and UN agencies are going one step further, aiming to reduce damage before it strikes. In this 30 minute film back2back investigates how poor farmers in Honduras and fishing communities in Vietnam are working with disaster risk managers to strengthen nature's defenses against the violent effects of climate change.This film was made for BBC World's long running environmental series, 'Earth Report'.
