Thinking...

 A young woman enters a silent, Buddhist, meditation retreat only to find the idea of a 'quiet mind' impossible. As she sits, she journeys though a budding relationship from its innocent beginning to its sexually awakened end and continues from there into a world of chaos and confusion that could only exist in the imagination. 'thinking' is the comical, back-and-forth struggle of distraction one experiences while trying not to be distracted.
