Tungsten

 Tungsten deals with the idea of electricity as a metaphor, the scenery is urban, and the plot is unfolded during a single day. One day in Athens, continuous outages, and a final blackout, caused by the strike of technicians at the electricity company. A day during which, six people's lives are being crossed and diverted. The heroes wander around the city, and as the day passes by and the darkness prevails, the scenery becomes more and more threatening. The heroes will experience intense discomfort while crossing each others path. When this strain is absorbed they are turned into victims, when the strain is channeled they are turned into perpetrators.
