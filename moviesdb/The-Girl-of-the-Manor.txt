The Girl of the Manor

 In a beautiful house lived unhappy Marjorie Briscom. Her guardian aunt, a heartless, cold woman, much in love with and loved by the Count de Villiers, conspired to hasten the death of Marjorie so that she might herself inherit the wonderfully rich estate that was now Marjorie's. To this end she exercised her power of guardian by providing a hunchback, horribly repulsive in appearance and a cocaine fiend, to follow the girl about the spacious gardens and never to let her across the threshold of the garden gate. From the hotel to the beach came Ralph Beresford. He strolled idly along, and seeing a garden, entered. Marjorie, strolling in the path close to the tree in which the hunchback secreted his cocaine, found opportunity to elude him. The attraction was mutual, and in the days that followed they met frequently. Conscious of the stranger's attention, the guardian aunt sent for Count de Villiers. Leaving him on the balcony she found Marjorie and Ralph in a nook in the garden. She asked him to step to the house and he followed, wondering, leaving Marjorie alone. On the balcony he met the Count, who at a gesture from the aunt, explained that Marjorie was his insane wife. Horrified Ralph left. Strolling the beach a few days later, and drawn by the bonds of love, he went to the garden gate. She came to meet him. There was a moment of hesitation, then explanation, and two lonesome souls had found their mates.
