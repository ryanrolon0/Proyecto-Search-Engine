Un mari de trop

 28 year old StEphanie Vasseur feels like all her dreams have come true. Young, beautiful, and eager to succeed in life, she's just been hired as the new editor-in-chief of the prestigious "GLAM" fashion magazine. She thinks she's attained perfect happiness after the proposal of GrEgoire de Rougemont, a well-bred lawyer. But there's a problem is, StEphanie lied about her past, her working class origins and the fact that she's still married to her ex, Alex, who's still in the North of France. Now, unbeknownst to GrEgoire and his suspicious father, she must go back to Calais to finally divorce Alex. There, the region is in a crisis after the lace factory closed down, and face-to-face with her roots, StEphanie starts to doubt the reason for which she returned.
