The Skin Quilt Project

 The influence of the African American quilting tradition in encouraging an appreciation for African American cultural heritage. The main focus of the film is to discuss how quilting provides confidence and self-esteem to African Americans who quilt, specifically for those who have suffered from the affects of colorism or skin color prejudice within the African American community.
