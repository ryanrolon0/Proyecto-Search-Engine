The Kiss in the Tunnel

 A train heads for a tunnel. In one car, a restless man smokes, and a woman is reading on the seat opposite him. In the darkness of the tunnel, he rises, crosses over to her seat and the two share a willing embrace and kiss. The train steams out of the tunnel toward us and past us.
