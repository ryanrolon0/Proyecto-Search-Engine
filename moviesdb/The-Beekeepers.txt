The Beekeepers

 A feature length college comedy that follows a group of aging super-seniors during summer break at Statham County University. In the tradition of Clerks, Knocked Up, and Superbad, comes a new perspective on the aging slacker and their place (or lack thereof) in the universe. When societal misfits Gary, Barrett, and Mike embark on a quest to save a comatose companion, a new found sense of destiny overcomes them; A destiny that would change their lives forever. Only after you see the world through their eyes can you possibly understand the depth of the frequently repugnant, but infinitely resilient, beekeepers.
