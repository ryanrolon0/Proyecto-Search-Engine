The Loneliness of the Puppet Maker

 In a small workshop a puppet maker works in isolation, developing an unusual relationship with his creations. The lifelike puppet heads seem to be his only friends. He gives them names, personalities and even adventures they supposedly undertook on their own. The loneliness of the puppet maker was made by accident. The film was entirely improvised by the brilliant poet and actor Peter John Cooper on the set of Lucile and the idleness of the mechanical men, a longer film also directed by Iosu Vakerizzo.
