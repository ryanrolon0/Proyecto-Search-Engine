The Candyman Conspiracy

 Paco, Pablo, and Jorge are three of the world's most wanted drug lords. In an attempt to gain $15,000,000 they hold a young boy hostage and wait for his family to comply with the money. The boy's father is a recognized farmer/drug lord in the country. And he will not rest until a fair fight for his son arises.
