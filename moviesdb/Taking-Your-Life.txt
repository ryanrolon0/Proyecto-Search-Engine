Taking Your Life

 A documentary maker meets an old woman at a screening of his new film, she tells him she wants him to film the last week of her life, then she will commit suicide at the end. The woman is not sick but believes she has lived a long and good life and has nothing more to live for, the documentary maker thinks it is fantastic, but he and his crew's attitudes take a change as the big day gets closer. After Nate's latest documentary fails to connect with a theatrical audience, he is approached by an elderly woman, Helen, who asks that he make a film about her. 'Why make a film about you?' he asks. 'Because at the end of the week, I'm going to commit suicide.' is the reply. Nate accepts the challenge while his partner, Hilary, expresses doubts. Over the course of three or four long filming days, Hilary comes to love this eccentric old lady and to accept the reasons for her suicide. At first Nate can only see the attention this project will earn, but as Helen relates stories from her life and goes through her final preparations, it is Nate now who has doubts about what they are all doing. In the end he must decide to continue this project or to walk away from the chance of a lifetime. Taking Your Life is heartbreakingly real and all about the choices we make when we choose control, and when we choose to let go, and the not so rare instances when the two are the same.
