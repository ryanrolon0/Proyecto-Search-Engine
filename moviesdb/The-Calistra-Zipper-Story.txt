The Calistra Zipper Story

 Calistra Zipper, a beautiful 14-year-old girl, begged her father Anthony to have her preserved for all time when she learned of her imminent premature demise. Rejecting burial and cremation in favor of human preservation, Anthony suffered humiliation and ridicule by the society at large and struggles to deal with all the ramifications human taxidermy implies.
