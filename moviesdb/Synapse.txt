Synapse

 Seth Alden, a 28 year old graduate neural science student, has been experimenting with the possible electromagnetic manipulation of the brain. He is led to experiment on himself - giving him an ability similar to telepathy. Through a new perspective, Seth begins to experience other people's perceptions, vulnerabilities, ulterior motives, and inner-selves. As the telepathic ability grows, he experiences repeated blackouts and alternate realities. He becomes isolated and paranoid... and ultimately uncovers what existence truly means.
