Spring and Saganaki

 The first-half story of this two-story cartoon finds "Hattie" greeting the coming of "Spring" with an earful of music and an eyeful of romance between her two dolls; the second one has Hamilton Ham & His World Players presenting the tale of a Japanese woodcutter who wants to be an Imperial Soldier. The regular soldiers laugh at his banner...but it is his banner that makes the bandits laugh, and be easily captured.
