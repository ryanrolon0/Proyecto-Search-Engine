U.S. Monitor Miantonomah Steaming Into Key West

 Here again is our own Miantonomah as she arrives at Key West. To those who may never witness a war vessel in fighting trim this picture appeals. A grander sight cannot be conceived. To see how easily our well-trained marines manoeuver this monster sea fighter is beyond conception. The pictures are brilliant and the movements perfect in detail. To see these films is to buy them, and we are taxed to our utmost capacity to fill orders for them. These are the only films on the market of the giant Miantonomah.
