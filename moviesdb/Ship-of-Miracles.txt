Ship of Miracles

 The inspiring documentary about the journey to learn about the amazing rescue of 14000 men, women, and children by of a handful of American merchant seamen on a single voyage during the Hungnam evacuation on Christmas Eve 1950. Through mine fields, fog, darkness, and enemy fire, no one on the ship lost their life. Five babies were born during the journey. The boat captain was so moved by the experience that he became a monk in New Jersey. The Maritime Commission and the Guiness Book of Records has called this the 'Greatest Sea Rescue in the History of Mankind"
