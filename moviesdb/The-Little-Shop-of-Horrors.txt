The Little Shop of Horrors

 Seymour is a young man who works in a flower store. He manages to create a carnivorous plant that feeds on human flesh. Nobody knows about it, so Seymour and the plant become good "friends". The plant needs food to grow up, so it convinces him to start killing people. Classic black comedy about young schnook who develops a bloodthirsty plant and is forced to kill in order to feed it. The basis for the later hit stage musical.
