Spatula Madness

 "Spatula Madness" is an animated comedy about fate, war and the importance of identity. Our hero, Edward, is your average working class spatula. He lives his uneventful life without giving much attention to the world around him. Unfortunately for Edward, the world is paying quite a bit of attention to him. He is soon recruited by the United Spatula Secret Resistance to fight the many vicious enemies that threaten the great "Spatula Way." Edward's dull and meaningless life is quickly turned into a spiraling vortex of madness from which he may never recover.
