Seeking Love in Foreign Places

 On the other side of the world there is a country full of attractive, intelligent, successful women...with bleak prospects for a husband. Beautiful women who aren't concerned about a man's age as long as he is "like a stone wall that they can stand behind." We traveled to the Bridal Basket of the World, Ukraine, with four American men fleeing the American dating scene weary of the "games women play" on their mission to find a potential wife. Seeking Love in Foreign Places challenges your views about women, love, sex, relationships and marriage.
