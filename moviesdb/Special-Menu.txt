Special Menu

 John Kinder is a successful advertising executive. He has a great house, a healthy 401k, a plasma television, but something is missing. He has no friends, no family, and no future. But that is all about to change... Quitting his job and climbing into his car, John sets out on an adventure. He ends up in a mystical pizza parlor where dreams and nightmares can come true, if you order items off of the "Special Menu".
