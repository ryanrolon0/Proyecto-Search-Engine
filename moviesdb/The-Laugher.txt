The Laugher

 A man tells his son he is a professional laugher to protect him from the hard life of janitorial work. When the son finds out, he learns the realities of work, family and life. But it is not until he grows up and has his own child that he will understand his father's lie. This is a story that spans two generations and depicts the complicated relationship between father-son.
