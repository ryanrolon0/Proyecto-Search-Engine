Precipice

 Roman is flown in to do a job, maybe his last. It is the evening before Jasper's financial wrong doings become public and Jasper's co- conspirators are unsure if Jasper will talk or take the fall. What should be a straightforward pick up and drop off for Roman is not, it seems Jasper wants to make one last stop along the way.
