The Yoke's on Me

 Rejected by the armed services, the stooges decide to "do their bit" by becoming farmers. After paying $1000 and throwing in their car, the boys are owners of a run down farm, which lacks any livestock. After capturing an escaped ostrich, they decide to carve jack-o- lanterns for profit and then must contend with some Japanese who have escaped from a relocation center. The stooges become heroes by capturing the escapees, with the help of explosive eggs laid by the ostrich who had swallowed some blasting powder.
