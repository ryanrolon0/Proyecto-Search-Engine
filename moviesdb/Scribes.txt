Scribes

 Shot during the 2003 Surrey International Writers' Conference, SCRIBES takes its audience through the basics of story telling to the details and difficulties involved in being a professional writer. Viewers will be given the inside scoop through workshops, keynote speeches, and one-on-one interviews with best-selling authors, powerhouse agents and editors, producers, and publishers to find out what it takes to break into the field. SCRIBES is a humorous, honest, and sometimes painful look at the writing industry
