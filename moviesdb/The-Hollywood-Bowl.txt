The Hollywood Bowl

 Snugly nestled in the natural amphitheater of the Hollywood Hills, the world famous Hollywood Bowl has been a venue for all styles of the world's greatest music since 1922. The history of one of Southern California's most recognizable cultural icons is told in The Hollywood Bowl Stars, now available to all public television stations through the American Public Television Service. From the end of June to mid-September every year, nearly one million people fill the over 17,000 seat amphitheater to experience world-class performances of symphonic, pop, rock, country, theatrical and world music. The Hollywood Bowl celebrates the 80th anniversary of this truly magical place, which has seen almost every famous crooner and musical performer -- from Aerosmith and Fred Astaire to Trisha Yearwood and Frank Zappa -- tread across its well-hallowed boards. The Hollywood Bowl epitomizes the laid-back lifestyle L.A. is known for the world over.
