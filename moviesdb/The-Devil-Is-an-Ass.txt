The Devil Is an Ass

 "The devil is an ass to think that he can corrupt the human race. They are already more corrupt than he." Pug, a lesser devil, come to London for the time of two days with the hopes of corrupting the denizens there. When he arrives he finds that they are more dishonest, more deceitful and more evil than hell could ever make them. Infact, they are the embodiment of iniquity.
