Pretty Dolly

 Leon has bought his wife a fancy doll for her birthday. Before he can give it to her, it falls into the fireplace and is burned up. To make things worse, when his wife finds a tuft of hair left over from the doll, she assumes that Leon has been seeing another woman. She follows Leon to work, where Leon's private secretary soon gets Leon into even more trouble.
