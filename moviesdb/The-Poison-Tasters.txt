The Poison Tasters

 Two men of uncertain origins, Crawford and Georg, occupy a blacked-out Polish flat on the eve of the Nazi invasion, 1942. Their odd philosophical modes, both cynical and brooding, are their daily discourse. When the family of Professor Mirek takes refuge in the flat, Crawford is smitten by his young daughter, Anna. At first she is disdainful of Crawford's attentions. But in the face of almost certain death--she consents to fall in love. Crawford then stuns her by revealing his purpose in coming to the war. Following this revelation, their love undergoes a tortuous transformation, subtly colored by Georg, whose primordial conflict with Crawford remains unabated. When the Germans finally storm their building, all are exposed to the harshest of light.
