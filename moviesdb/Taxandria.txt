Taxandria

 Partly improvised dramatic thriller involving death, madness, love and sickness. Four actors, two actresses, one location. Three brothers, one sister plus husband and one nurse. Grandma is dead. The family is getting together to prepare the funeral and the heritage, but father doesn't show up. It seems everybody has its own reason to be present.
