River Right of Passage

 River Right of Passage chronicles an 18-day Grand Canyon expedition of two generations of river-runners, providing a window into unique familial and community relationships that center around whitewater rafting. The documentary follows Marty, Rick, and Steve who all started boating in the early 1980's. Whitewater rafting is such a fundamental part of their lives that these men raised their children on the water. 16-year-old Shon is a daredevil kayaker, 17-year-old Kelsey is an avid boater, and twenty-year-old Noah is a competent guide. Only 14-year-old Eliza has fears about whitewater and is ill at ease. While the wilderness hazards of rainstorms, sandstorms, sunburn, dehydration, extreme winds, poisonous reptiles, and turbulent waters are challenging; interpersonal dynamics and the emotional stresses of expedition prove to be admirable adversaries.
