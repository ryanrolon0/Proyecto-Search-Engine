Vernon

 Vernon Ah Kee is regarded as one of the most compelling contemporary Aboriginal artists in Australia. This short Documentary follows Vernon as he draws one of his amazing charcoal portraits. His portraits challenge and resurface the past injustices done to aboriginal people in Australia, particularly on Palm Island where his grandparents and family were photographed by researcher by Norman Tindale.
