The Immortal Blacksmith

 This Passing Parade short tells the true story of Vermont blacksmith and inventor Tom Davenport, who lived the first half of the 19th century. He purchased an electro-magnet, not sure what he would do with it. He eventually invented the modern electric motor. This is an unusual entry in the Passing Parade series, because the characters speak their own dialog, with narration at a minimum.
