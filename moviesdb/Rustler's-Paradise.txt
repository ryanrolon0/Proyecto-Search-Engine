Rustler's Paradise

 Cheyenne joins El Diablo's gang looking for his long time missing wife and daughter. After saving Romero from the gang he returns to get Connie who he now realizes is his daughter. Captured, he escapes with Connie and they return to Romero's just ahead of El diablo's attacking gang. Cheyenne Kincaid, searching for his long-missing wife and baby daughter, joins the gang of El Diablo which has a stronghold in the hills, where they can raid the surrounding countryside with impunity. There he meets 15-year-old Connie, El Diablo's step-daughter who he treats brutally. Rancher Romero is captured and ordered to give up his hacienda and lands but refuses. Tied to a tree, he is made a target by knife-throwing henchman Antonio, but is rescued by Cheyenne and they ride for his hacienda. They are greeted by Romero's daughter Dolores and Cheyenne learns from her that El Diablo's wife disappeared suddenly and her name was Maybeth. Cheyenne now knows that El Diablo is his man and that Connie is his child. He rides back to the outlaw camp, finds the gang absent, talks with Connie, investigates an old truck, finds a picture of Connie's mother, and a diary in which the Mother regrets her blindness for leaving Cheyenne for such a fiend as Rance Kimball... the man now known as El Diablo. Cheyenne is captured and left bound and guarded by Antonio while the bandits ride to attack the Romero hacienda...after they stop off in El Dorado for a drink. Cheyenne escapes and rides with Connie for Romero's. Warned of the approaching raid, Dolores sends her admirer Larry Martin to a neighboring ranch for help while Cheyenne, Romero and his vaqueros wage a battle against the attacking outlaws.
