The Last Gangster

 Gangster Joe Krozac is in prison for ten years. Reporter Paul North is fired by his newspaper for writing articles sympathetic to Krozac's wife and young son. She divorces Krozac and marries North. When Korzac gets out he goes looking for his former wife and son. A tale of crime in the Prohibition era, introduced by the message story starts in 1927 ... America is in the criminal chaos of a national mistake ... American communities throttled by men with a genius for ruthlessness, organised evil and vast, law-evading power. America, 1927."
