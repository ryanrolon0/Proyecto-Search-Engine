Up Down Around

 Everything has its journey. The journey is inside-outside, down-up, long-short. 'Tubes' a unique character of London are the guides, the map of the city, the route. These includes wires, rain-pipes and trains. Here my journey through the city's various spaces, textures and materiality reveals a city tied in a web of links and connections. Along the way the passage of time is felt through the degradation of materials, new-old architectures and features co-existing. The most distinct feature of these degradations are caused by water/rain, an important part of London's climate and ultimately of life. Life is organic and its diversity strives through all rigid and planned human creations.
