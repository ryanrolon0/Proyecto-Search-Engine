The Warlords

 Adolf Hitler's dream was realized in the creation of the S.S., the most brutal and prestigious cult of men to arise from the Nazi cause. United with the League of German Girls, founded to provide the S.S. with perfect Aryan children, they were fanatical followers of Adolf Hitler's edict to wipe out the enemy and build a new race of Aryan supermen. Their devotion to this cause, and the holocaust that resulted, is only part of the incredible history revealed in new and shocking archival footage.
