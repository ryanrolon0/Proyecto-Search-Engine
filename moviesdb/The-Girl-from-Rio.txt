The Girl from Rio

 Marquita Romero, a South American singer in New York, is striving to secure the release of her brother, Carlos, who has been framed on an arson charge through the conniving of the owner of a night club whose sideline racket is collecting insurance on arson fires he has created. She is aided by Steven Ward, who with the help of an investigator for the insurance company, plans to get the evidence on the racketeer by having Marquita getting a job as a singer in the nightclub. She secures the needed proof in the form of a stamp collection in the gangster's safe that the insurance had been collected on. Meanwhile, the crook's jealous girlfriend has discovered Maquita's plan and has blown the whistle on her.
