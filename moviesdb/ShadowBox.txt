Shadowbox

 A war hero returns home, traumatized by the memories of his imprisonment. Unable to reconnect with his wife and son, he forces himself to relive the war by watching the film of his own torture. He becomes a voyeur, longing for his on-screen self to choose a different path, one that would allow him to return to civilian life.
