 Sweet, innocent Lisa is kidnapped by a red-haired thug. When her roommate, Holly, returns home, she finds a ransom note. Rather than paying the ransom, Holly tries to track down the kidnapper alone, which only results in her capture. Now the thug has two lovely hostages, but no one to pay cash for their return. What will be the ladies' fate?
