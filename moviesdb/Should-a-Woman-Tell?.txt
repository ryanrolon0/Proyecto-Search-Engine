Should a Woman Tell?

 A village girl, on a visit to the city of Boston, is taken advantage of by a man there, and returns to her home feeling sullied and ashamed. A young man who had once sought her hand returns from years away in Europe and reiterates his suit. She returns his love and agrees to marry him, but has difficulty telling him the truth about her mis adventure. When she finally does, his response seems to doom the pair to tragedy.
