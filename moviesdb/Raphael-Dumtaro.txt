Raphael Dumtaro

 Raphael, a ladies man-esque purveyor of women, has recently returned from worldwide journeys in search of self perfection. Having seemingly obtained it he returns to the US to re-claim the two loves of his life, Vicky & Maria. His hopes are dashed as he is rejected by both of them and takes the audience on a quest to find the perfect woman, as he re-acclimatizes to the world he left behind and offers words of wisdom on the love battlefront.
