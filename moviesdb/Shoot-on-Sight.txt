Shoot on Sight

 Shoot on Sight' goes undercover into Burma to show the humanitarian and human rights crisis created by the military junta's current attacks on Karen ethnic minority civilians in eastern Burma, where over 3000 villages have been destroyed, abandoned or forcibly relocated in the past decade. The human rights videographers travel with villagers on the run from a year of attacks, and provide graphic evidence of the destruction and human cost.
