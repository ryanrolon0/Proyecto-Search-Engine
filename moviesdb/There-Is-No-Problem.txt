There Is No Problem

 In a satsang given in Santa Cruz, California, Adyashanti delivers the message that there is no problem, a message the mind perpetually resists. He begins by discussing the nature of truth and then mentions the satsang he had that morning in Oakland. He gave a long talk (too long, he suspects) on how no one really has a problem; but then all but one of the people who had questions nevertheless wanted to discuss their problems. The mind creates the illusion that there is a problem. But who we are, who we truly are, has no problem at all. Adyashanti admits that he once would have found this message insulting, as would many people, especially when they are experiencing profound trouble in their lives. Yet in the awakened state, one realizes, even in the midst of chaos, that problems do not exist. Later, three members of the audience come on stage. The first is a man, bearing the gift of tea, who wants to discuss the power of prayer. The second is a man who is losing his fear of becoming alienated from his wife and kids as he learns who he truly is. The third is a woman, named Bonnie, who has difficulty accepting the idea that there is no problem when it comes to certain horrors in the world, especially when children are victims of war and other kinds of violence.
