Stone of Silver Creek

 Stone runs an honest saloon and gives Mason back his money two card sharps take from him. The Reverend overhears the two plan to get the money back. He is on hand when they make their raid but they shoot him and take off with the money. Stone catches up with them but is in trouble when they outmaneuver him.
