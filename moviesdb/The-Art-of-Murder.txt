The Art of Murder

 Elizabeth Sheridan is a painter, living in a beautiful home on the coast near Seattle, where her wealthy husband Cole runs a yacht-building company. Elizabeth and the firm's top designer, Tony Blanchard, are having an affair. A particularly nasty blackmailer confronts her with pictures, threatening to give them to Cole; she and Tony agree to pay, but after two deaths and a torched house, things have gotten complicated pales next to a murder charge. An high-school yearbook photo takes her further into danger. What motive might explain and connect the twists? Is she ensnared beyond hope?
