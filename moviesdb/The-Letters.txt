The Letters

 As she nears the important transition point of high school graduation, April writes a letter to her childhood friend Jiyoon from whom she is separated by thousands of miles. Against the mundane backdrop of her life in a small rural town, April reveals to her friend the colorful world of her dreams and passions, as well as the fears that accompany her uncertainties regarding the future. When obstacles befall her path, she finds strength in the childhood memories she and Jiyoon share -- remembrances she will forever keep.
