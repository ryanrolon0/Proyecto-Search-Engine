Tom Sawyer's Funny Business

 After a fire destroys the famous Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco, the owner, Tom Sawyer and his crew of stand-up comedians begin to rebuild. With unlimited access to Sawyer, the comedians and the club, award-winning filmmaker David Schendel (Yank Tanks, 2002) documents the hair-raising roller coaster ride to re-open the legendary independent venue and keep it open against all odds, including the 800-pound gorilla breathing down its neck, Clear Channel.
