Toyland Broadcast

 The toys present a musical revue on their own radio station. First, three dolls sing, then a jack-in-the-box doing a 'Bing Crosby' (qv) impression joins in. Then an instrumental piece, with a bead man dancing on a xylophone, a couple of dolls playing matched toy pianos, and various characters dancing on the keyboards. A violinist plays his tune actually, the violin dances around, doing most of the work. A calico dog sings, "I think that I shall never see, a poem lovely as a tree." Station ABC broadcasts the Toyland Revue. All the toys in the nursery have come to life to entertain the listeners. A toy soldier is now a radio broadcaster. Baby dolls sing "Mississippi Moon." They are joined by a crooning Bing Crosby-like jack-in-the-box. A Kate Smith-like doll interrupts to sing a brief rendition of "When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain." A roly-poly toy, which looks like Paul Whiteman, cranks a Sambo Jazz Band music box. A bead man dances on a xylophone. A floppy-eared stuffed toy dog, which looks like Rudy Vallee, plays the saxophone. A duck pull toy rolls across the piano. Two French dolls perform the Apache Dance on the piano. Rubinoff and his anthropomorphic violin play "Trees" as a calico dog performs the vocals. Three toy singers in chocolate-flavored blackface makeup sing "Jungle Fever." The jazz band provides an explosive finish.
