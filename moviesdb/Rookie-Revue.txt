Rookie Revue

 Random gags around military life, set on an army base. A bugler uses a jukebox to play reveille. In formation, one private has a great deal of trouble remembering what comes after "3"; after he gets it, he decides not to go for the $32 question. In the mess hall, the machine gunners machine gun their food while the bombers catch falling biscuits. The infantry marches for miles - past a "next time, take the train" billboard. The camouflage troops march by, invisibly. We see training substitutes guns, cars marked "tank" and, alas, a banner marked "parachute" deployed in mid-jump. More training division has target practice, on an aerial shooting gallery. Finally, in an elaborate process, a general provides firing instructions to a big gun; when it hits his own building, he says, "I'm a baaad general."
