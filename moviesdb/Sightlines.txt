Sightlines

 A lonely New Yorker (David) turns to the adult classifieds to find some company. What he gets is a visit from an argumentative night crawler named Sonny. After several rounds of verbal sparring they begin to warm up to each other, and soon learn that a fresh set of eyes can help one see the world like never before.
