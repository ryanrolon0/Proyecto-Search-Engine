The Adventurous Sex

 A young man (Rawlinson) spends so much time at work on his airplane that he neglects his girl (Bow). She goes out on her own to live the high life, but her reputation is soiled by a letcherous Adventurer (Williams). The young woman resolves to kill herself, and throws herself into the water rushing towards niagra falls, but is saved at the last minute by her former sweetheart. Their mode of rescue, a rope ladder hung from an airplane. They are reconciled and the letcher gets his dues.
