Poochie

 Poochie, a little pink dog who runs a newspaper advice column for her owner, receives a letter from a little boy who has literally lost his father in Cairo, Egypt. Poochie and her robotic servant, Hermes, travel there to help him and end up finding a lost city that would prefer to keep its secrets.
