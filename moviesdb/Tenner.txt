Tenner

 TENNER is a powerful coming-of-age drama, written and directed by David O'Neill, unfolding through an act of revenge. HOMER, a seemingly dysfunctional teenager who lives with his eccentric bong-smoking grandfather, JOLLY, is holding a vendetta against local shop-owner PARDIP. A surprise twist in the story sees HOMER attempt to deftly escape a curfew imposed on him by electronic tagging by the Home Office, and reveals why this campaign of revenge may be justifiable.
