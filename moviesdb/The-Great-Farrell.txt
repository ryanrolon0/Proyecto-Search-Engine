The Great Farrell

 A great but painfully shy painter, Priam Farrell (Ganz) takes on the identity of his valet, Henry (Everett), to escape to a simpler life in the English countryside. Things take an unexpected turn when, painting as the simple valet, Priam is accused of forging the works of the great Farrell.
