Screen Snapshots Series 26, No. 5

 This Columbia Screen Snapshots (number 5 for the 1946-47 production year with a production number of 8855) finds Staub and his camera paying (undeserved) homage to the radio and print-media gossip columnists of the era, including the unforgettable (not to mention you-gotta-be-kidding) Louella "Lolly" Parsons and Hedda "The Hat" Hopper.
