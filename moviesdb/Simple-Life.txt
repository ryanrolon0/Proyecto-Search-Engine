Simple Life

 Done entirely in computer animation, this film follows a cat living in an all-cat world as he lives his simple life through his boring office job, then goes out with his friends or meets his girlfriend. His dreams, however, are of traveling to distant lands or even other planets. In the end, he's happy with his life the way it is.
