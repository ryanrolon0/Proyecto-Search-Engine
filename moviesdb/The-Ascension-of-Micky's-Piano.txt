The Ascension of Micky's Piano

 A film featuring the upright piano of Micky Gulless, who decided to release her family's cherished instrument from it's "thing-ness" by burning it. A performance, by pianist Jeffrey Neufeld, is weaved with Micky's eloquent and touching statement, describing her motives for such an act. The Ascension of Micky's Piano celebrates the memory of times gone by, and of the people who lived those times. It celebrates the convenience of modern day living, the hard work of past generations, and our abilities to earn a living with ideas and intellect, instead of hard physical labor.
