The Eternal Object

 The Eternal Object documents an art project built by two Cuban artists, Francis Acea and Diengo Hernandez, at The Banff Centre for the Arts in Banff Alberta, Canada. The film addresses Cuban art practices of the 1990's in view of perestroika and the American Embargo. The voiceover interview with the artists was recorded in downtown Havana, Cuba. The Eternal Object is shot on black & white 16mm with an original score by Do Make Say Think.
