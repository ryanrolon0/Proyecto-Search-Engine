The Auctioneers

 A gritty and fast-paced tale of tragedy, greed, human trafficking and revenge, "The Auctioneers" will do for Sizemore what "Pulp Fiction" did for John Travolta Having lost his family to a global and anonymous ring of child traffickers, Abel Cain has willingly let go of his moral conscience to get his revenge. Set against the backdrop of Los Angeles, the city provides the perfect tone for "The Auctioneers" to hearken back to the Sunset Noir pieces of the 80's like "To Live and Die in L.A." and "Manhunter."
