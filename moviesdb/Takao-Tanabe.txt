Takao Tanabe

 "Takao Tanabe greatest painters. The film is both political and historical since Tanabe was interned in the Interior of B.C. during World War II and began painting in the early days of the American abstract expressionist movement in the late 1940's. His compelling canvasses were recently showcased in his first retrospective at the Vancouver Art Gallery. Tanabe is very direct and articulate and does not lend himself to false flattery; this film gives the audience a true sense of the man whilst at the same time they are privy to their own retrospective viewing of his remarkable body of work. Now in his early 80's, Tanabe is still avidly painting and continues to push boundaries in art.
