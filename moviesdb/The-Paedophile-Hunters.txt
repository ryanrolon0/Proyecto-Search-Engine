The Paedophile Hunters

 Given exclusive access to one of America's most secret law enforcement agencies, this film follows the agents of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) as they track down, arrest and extradite American paedophile sex tourists. In Cambodia, ex cop Chris Matarelli works alongside former Khmer Rouge boy soldier Vansak Suos, investigating Americans who have abused children as young as four - sometimes sold to them by their own parents. As in extraordinary rendition, these agents work under the radar - but so far, eighty-five offenders have been brought back to America to face justice in American courts.
