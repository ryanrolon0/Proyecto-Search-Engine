The Head V the Heart

 The Head V The Heart is a comic and slightly surreal short film about unrequited love. A young man is in love with a young woman, but he cannot tell her how he feels, until he can resolve the conflict between his heart and his head, LITERALLY! The film has a universal theme which everyone should be able to relate to, no matter where they are in the world!
