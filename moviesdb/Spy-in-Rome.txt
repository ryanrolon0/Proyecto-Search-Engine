Spy in Rome

 India-based Scientist, Dr. Sharma, gains international recognition when he surgically transforms a couple in their sixties to their twenties. Another Scientist, Dr. Chang, based in Rome, Italy, who has also perfected a formula for the human brain, wants Dr. Sharma to assist him in making the perfect human so that a master race can be formed to rule Earth. When Dr. Sharma refuses to co-operate, he is abducted and held by Dr. Chang and his gang. The Indian Secret Service assigns this case to Agents XX7 and 005, namely Rajesh and Bulbul respectively, who are assisted by Dr. Sharma's daughter, Kamini. The trio travel to Italy, unaware that they await a fate of unbelievable pain in Dr. Chang's torture chamber & an army of women in bathing suits that is waiting to pull Kamini apart. Dr. Sharma will be given a choice - either co-operate or risk losing Kamini's life.
