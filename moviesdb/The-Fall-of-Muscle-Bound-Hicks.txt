The Fall of Muscle-Bound Hicks

 Harry's sweetheart becomes infatuated with Muscle-Bound Hicks, the pugilistic champion, so Harry decides to take boxing lessons and challenge Hicks. Harry discovers that a cheese, on which the manager is training his champion to make him strong, makes Hicks sick. On the night of the fight, when Harry is being chased all over the ring, his second observes one of the audience eating a cheese sandwich of the kind Hicks dislikes. They secure the cheese, daub it on Harry's gloves and Hicks quickly meets his finish. Then Harry's sweetheart tells him he is her hero.
