Press Gang

 The year is 2006. An unprecedented number of US Troops are stationed all over the world, re-enlistment is at a record low, military values subjugate the political, and conscription has become law once again. "Homeland's Most Wanted Draft Dodgers" is television's newest reality smash hit. Broadcast "live", an elite team of Selective Service Commandos scour the country hunting down the guilty and stamping out dissent. Press Gang explores the inescapable realities of life in these times. The Appleton family has always believed in paying your dues, towing the line, and doing what's expected. But when their youngest comes home from college, she brings with her a terrible secret. Suddenly, those far away issues are smack in the middle of the dinner table.
