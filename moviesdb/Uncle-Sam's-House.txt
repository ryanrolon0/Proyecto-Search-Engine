Uncle Sam's House

 The fractured Sylvan family gathers for their father Sam's memorial and the return of James, the eldest son, from active duty in Iraq. The film follows the day leading up to James' arrival from the perspective of each of his three sisters as they confront their own mixed emotions about their brother's future and their father's legacy. Watching from the sidelines, their cousin Dylan realizes he has a lot to learn about his once-beloved uncle and the family he always loved more than his own.
