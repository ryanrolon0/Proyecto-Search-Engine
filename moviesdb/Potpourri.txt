Potpourri

 A group of students at a liberal arts college in Minneapolis is faced with expulsion if their final papers in philosophy class are not satisfactory. As a result, the inept group of friends decides to experiment with a series of illicit drugs, in an effort to expand their cognitive horizons and help them better understand some of the mind-bending concepts of the course. Each is taken on a different adventure as the students begin to realize how severely they've underestimated the effects of the drugs.
