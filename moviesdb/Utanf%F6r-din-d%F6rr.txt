 Andrew is a real loner. He works as an illustrator at a news paper and his life is pretty okay. But he has one big problem. He is shy. Very shy. Especially with girls. Andrew moves to a small town way up north to isolate himself from the rest of the world. One day he runs into the lovely Sannah. She gets quite curious about this man, who is not like anyone she's ever met before. She soon finds out it's hard to get to know him, or even to get nearby him! Andrew is infatuated with Sannah and fantazises about her but believes there's no chance she will like him if she gets to know him, so he decides it's better they never meet for real... Based in part on the writers / directors/ main actor Eric Donell's own life and experience, the carrying line of the movie is the main character who believes he is mentally ill, because of his tics, uncontrollable strange sounds and twitches. This has made this sweet person very shy. He longs for companionship and love but his strange behavior hinders him from even daring to try to build even social ties. What he does not know - but in a freeing scene in the end of the movie learns - is that he is not crazy, but simply has Tourettes Syndrome. After a disastrous attempt to talk to a girl at the office, and also the sudden death of his parents, he decides to leave his work and home in the big city and move out to a small picturesque town in norther Sweden where he isolates himself and tries to hide his "mental illness" as he thinks it is. But a young woman sees this charming man and becomes interested and pursues him with several both funny and tragic turns.
