 Set against the vibrant backdrop of the predominantly Muslim community of South Mumbai, 'Tuesday' is the riveting tale of twenty-two year old Farhan, a young man consumed by the mystery surrounding his father's ill-timed death. Believing his father was a victim of the 2006 Mumbai train blasts, Farhan time-travels 22 years into the past to Tuesday, July 11, to preclude his father's untimely demise. But when he discovers the shocking truth, Farhan realizes that sometimes it is better to leave the past in the past.
