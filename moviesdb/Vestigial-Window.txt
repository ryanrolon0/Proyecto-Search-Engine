Vestigial Window

 Driven by love Daniel, a dying scientist constructs an instrument that tunes into the frequency of human consciousness. He believes that this is achievable by using algorithms derived from the coils found in the bloodstream (DNA). With a deep respect for his passionate belief, his soul-mate Sarah follows his instructions in an effort to bridge the gap between life and death. When they meet in the astral plane they both realize that they are breaching the barrier of death. But the mystery of whether consciousness is in fact measurable becomes even more daunting to Daniel and for Sarah consciousness is the only thing that can save her from the lure of death's dream.
