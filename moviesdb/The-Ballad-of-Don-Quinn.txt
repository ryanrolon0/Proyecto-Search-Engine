The Ballad of Don Quinn

 Top Ten Canadian Shorts of the Nineites Made four years before Hard Core Logo, this story of an aging punk rocker who tries to revive his old band The Sponteneous Abortions is an underrated gem. Featuring a superb deadpan performance by Michael Burns, Quinn has a melancholic charm that sums up a lost generation. Watch for filmmaker Alan Zweig in the cast of characters.
