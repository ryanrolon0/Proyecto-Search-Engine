Spy Hunter

 Former F-15 pilot Alex Decker (The Rock) is recruited to become a member of a government agency called International Espionage Services (IES), specifically joining an elite group called the Spy Hunters. Piloting an experimental battle-car, the G-6155 Interceptor, with all varieties of weapons and gimmicks (including the ability to transform into a speed boat or a super-fast motorcycle), Sects and his fellow Spy Hunters are given the assignment of defeating Daemon Curry, the evil president of a cartel called NOSTRA International, which has plans of world domination. Of course, the bad guys have their own souped-up weapon-packed vehicles, and they don't like being "hunted".
