True Love

 Ion used to live in Berlin. He lived there with his girlfriend Marta. He had two cameras, a 16 mm one and a video tape one. Ion used to record everything in his little universe the restaurant he used to work in, his tattoos and the city landscape. One day, though, Marta left him. Now, he shoots the same spaces, but without her presence. The house is empty. A personal portrait of a city and a separation.
