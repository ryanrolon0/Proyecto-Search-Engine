Sampoorna Ramayana

 In Ayodha there are festivities all over as the day has arrived when Raja Dashrath will be crowning his eldest son, Ram, as the future King. But there is sorrow and anger in one part - that being with Rani Kaikayi - one of four wives of Raja Dashrath, who wants her son, Bharat, to be crowned King. Her laments and complaints make Dashrath give way to her, and she also makes him promise to send Ram away from Ayodha for 14 years. Ram accepts his step-mothers conditions, and sets out of Ayodha, with his wife, Seeta, and younger brother, Lakshman. The beginning of this journey is the beginning of the end of the tyranical Raja Ravan, and his rule on Lanka.
