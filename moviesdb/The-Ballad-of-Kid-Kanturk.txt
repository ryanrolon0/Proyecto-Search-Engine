The Ballad of Kid Kanturk

 "The Ballad of Kid Kanturk" is a love triangle of the blackest sort. In one corner is Slim, representing the last of what is good about real traditional values. In the other corner, the Kid, an amoral stranger dueling him onstage for the heart of his wife, Mona. And in this bog-Gothic duel of voices, all observed by a pair of mysterious Europeans with their own motive for revenge, true love has its work cut out.
