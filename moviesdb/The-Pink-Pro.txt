The Pink Pro

 The panther is an eager wanna-be instructor who forces his services on the short, pointy-nosed man. The man first chooses to be taught archery, but this only results in the man flying straight through the archery board, and the panther repeatedly failing his attempts to hit the board. Further lessons in skiing, sailing and sky diving result in the man to be severely injured and hospitalized. Still, the panther wants to teach the reluctant man water skiing and golf, resulting in more horrible accidents.
