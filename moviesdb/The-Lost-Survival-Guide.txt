The Lost Survival Guide

 The LOST Survival Guide's goal is first to engage and entertain the new viewer and arm them with enough information to begin watching LOST season 3. It's goal is also to re-engage the occasional viewer, and entertain the loyal fan. The show embraces the attitude, style and fun of Entertainment Weekly, complete with Must Lists, fun and cool side bar stories, trivia, and eye-catching graphic design. Throw in memorable clips as well as interviews with key LOST aficionados from Entertainment Weekly as well as interviews with LOST EP's Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, and you have a great half-hour of everything LOST! Oh...and did we mention Jimmy Kimmel? Be sure to watch for his own take on the show in the LOST Glossary.
