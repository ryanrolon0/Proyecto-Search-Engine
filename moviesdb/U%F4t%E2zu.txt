 Seven young men desperate for quick money arrive at a desolate seaside bar Dog Days to be auditioned for "hosts" - a highly popular occupation to entertain female patrons with smooth talk and soothing smile while offering drinks at the "host clubs." Although their previous jobs vary from a street performer to an ex-banker, they are all happy to get the dream job easily until they discover that the "manager" has run away with their deposits! Seeing them discouraged, the sympathetic bar owner offers his place to open up a host club by themselves. With the help of his granddaughter Chika, who has a heart disorder, despite their initial confusion mixed with personal problems and a typhoon that almost blew down the place, they gradually find the true meaning of friendship, trust and love.
