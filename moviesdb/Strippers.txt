Strippers

 In a disastrous economy, after loosing his job, Alan, an out of work executive, dreams a series of bizarre comedic worst case scenarios that could happen if society's "strippers" get a hold of him. After over ten years of being produced (1998), this dark comedic drama proves to be both current and relevant in a changing world. This is Jorge Ameer's second feature, yet his first 35mm motion picture and theatrical release.
