The Frozen North

 This Terry-Toon takes a look at some of the odd characters who populate the polar regions; a wolf whose only function is to howl at the moon all night, an Eskimo, with an igloo with a view, who acts out, and explains in double-talk, the details of his life; and the bear whose only occupation is to sleep around the clock.
