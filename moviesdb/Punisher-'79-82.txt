Punisher '79-82

 A short web series chronicling the Punisher's actions from 1979 - 1982. In those four years, each defined as an entry into the Punisher's journal, Frank Castle runs a foul, Jigsaw, Daredevil, a serial killer, a Junkie dressed up like Santa and a mess of thugs all "asking for it." But things slowly escalate to an all out warzone, as defined in the Punisher's final entry in 1982, as he takes on Typhoid Mary, Nuke, The Russian, Bullseye, Crossbone and a few more deadly foes.
