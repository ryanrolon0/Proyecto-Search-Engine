The Home Town Paper

 The weekly newspaper is the cornerstone of many a town, the newspaper which is a reflection of the town's values and thoughts. Its editor is the newspaper personified. He is much like a civil servant, working for the people of the community. His editorial is the most personal yet widespread contact he has with the community. The letters to the editor are democracy in action. News from the other side of the globe, which could affect townsfolk, makes it way to them through the newspaper. These world stories are equally as important as the news from around the corner, which again is a reflection of the town. The newspaper's main revenue source is through advertising, which in a way is its own form of news.
