The Stupid Cupid

 Cupid (who looks suspiciously like Elmer Fudd) is on the prowl around the farm. With his ever-accurate arrows (which have their tips replaced with suction cups for safety's sake), he spreads love to sometimes unwilling recipients. But when he sets his sights on Daffy, the duck wants no part of it. When Elm...erm...Cupid fires the largest arrow at his disposal at the hapless duck, Daffy falls for the nearest hen...who happens to be the main squeeze of the cock of the walk...
