Shiela's Payoff

 One of the earliest blue movies featuring some superb acting from all involved, and a crime plot that will make you remember "Reservoir Dogs" but adds some emotional interest. The various situations are all well paced as is the sexual payoff that Sheila encounters - with quite a bevy of horny friends along for the ride. Of special note are some early screen appearances of now legendary woodsmen - Paul Thomas & Don Fernando. A good mix of decadence! Mimi Morgan's boyfriend is killed by the Mob- to pay off a debt and now she is forced into prostitution. She now must work to get her- REVENGE! Sheila's Payoff will be HUGE!
