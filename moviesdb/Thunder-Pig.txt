Thunder Pig

 Our planet is in peril, threatened by collision from a speeding asteroid. Worse, global superhero Thunder Pig has taken to his bed, overwhelmed with misery at the state of his coiffure - in this five-minute pilot for Nickelodeon. Can the super-porker get a radical rug rethink and save the planet in this pizza-fueled tale of donuts and disaster? Prizes awarded for this film include 'Best TV Pilot' from the World Animation Celebration 2001.
