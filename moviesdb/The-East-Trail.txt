The East Trail

 A man - lost, alone, and freezing in the snow - stumbles upon a dead body. After "stealing" the corpse's hat for himself, the man makes his way to a crossroads tavern where he is given a dubious welcome. Suspicion leads to interrogation as the townsfolk steer him towards a difficult confession, and the hat of a dead man returns to its rightful owner.
