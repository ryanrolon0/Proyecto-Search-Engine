Super Mario RPG

 One day, Mario was rescuing the Princess from King Koopa. Suddenly, the Mushroom Kingdom was shook by the coming of a sword. With the Star Road shattered and the wishes of the Mushroom Kingdom unfulfilled, Mario and his friends must race against time, battling the metallic warriors of the invincible Smithy the Sword. On a quiet, peaceful day, Princess Toadstool is picking flowers near Mario's house when she is kidnapped by Bowser in his Clown Car. Mario goes to rescue her and defeats the Koopa King as usual-but this time, a greater dark force than anything Mario has ever seen descends-a giant sword named Exor, which comes crashing from the sky and smashes into Bowser's Keep. The three are scattered across the land. Mario later discovers that the villainous sword is the harbinger of the "Smithy Gang", a group of weapon-like monstrosities that plan world domination. To achieve this end, Exor destroyed the Star Road-seven special stars that transform normal wishes into realities. Mario will need the power of the Stars to help him save the day and restore wishing power to Mushroom Land, along with the help of new friends and old enemies...
