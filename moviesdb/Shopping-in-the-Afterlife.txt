Shopping in the Afterlife

 A dramedy in ten minutes. On an everyday trip to the grocery store, Charlie is standoffish with Blanche, a perfect stranger who insists he looks exactly like her deceased son. Charlie ultimately empathizes with Blanche and manages to share a kernel of his own broken past, only to realize in retrospect that Blanche isn't at all what she seemed.
