Rowdy Ann

 Ann is a cattleman's daughter, and she likes to get tough with everyone. When she catches her father in a saloon, she lassoes him and drags him out. When a cowhand offends her, she fights him and beats him. Determined to make Ann into a lady, her father sends her to college - but this means that she'll be around a lot of new people who have never before met a young woman like her.
