System Fault

 In this comedy/political satire, Mr. Middelo works as a custodian at Electronic Voting Laboratories (EVL), a company specializing in electronic voting machines. It's Election Day, and Mr. Middelo has just finished cleaning when two tech support employees named Vann and Wortham arrive. With it being Election Day, Vann and Wortham decide to show their respective partisan pride in unusual fashion. They quickly discover, however, that they're on opposite ends of the political spectrum. What ensues is a chaotic rivalry between the two, with Mr. Middelo caught in the middle of it all. And when the rivalry extends beyond the walls of EVL to a voting precinct, it's not just Vann and Wortham's, but everyone else's political colors that begin to show through.
