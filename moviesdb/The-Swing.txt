The Swing

 Jacob King's story is that of a family that never quite made it. While he worked hard to maintain the huge ranch that his father left him behind, he masked his worries and economic troubles with the bottle, and everyday mundane tasks that kept him outside - and away from his family. Eventually, a family that reached its breaking point... Now, Jacob continues to bandage the pain of an estranged wife and young daughter with even more booze and tinkering about the ranch. At night he spills his worries to the local bartenders who will listen. By day he sweats out the night before with mundane tasks to keep his mind away from the past. But he's soon to learn that sometimes the past won't leave us alone...
