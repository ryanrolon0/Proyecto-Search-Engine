 Gentle and tough. Fragile and existentially hard hitting. Those are a few of many labels you can put on Joanes Nielsen (f. 1953) - a fisherman, workman, socialist, nationalist, and - not least - writer and poet from the Faroe Islands, a small, self governing part of Denmark, situated in the middle of the North Atlantic. Joanes Nielsen is the strongest voice in modern Faroese literature and in this portrait film he generously shares the experiences, which have formed him as a writer. He is not afraid of showing his vulnerability as a human being and as a man. Alternating between narrative and poetry, the filmmaker Katrin Ottarsdottir gives us a fascinating portrait of what drives Joanes as a writer.
