Saturn

 Saturn is a 3D short, which was created at the University of Applied Sciences, Augsburg, as a diploma thesis. The six minute long film is an homage to Science Fiction and epic sceneries. Story orbs Tronyq, a wanted fugitive, is making for safety in a stolen spaceship. In order to reach a safe haven, he must navigate through Saturn's rocky asteroid fields. As he is suddenly ambushed by his enemies, his last hope starts to dwindle.
