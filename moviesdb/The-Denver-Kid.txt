The Denver Kid

 When Border Patrol Lieut. Roberts is killed, it appears that his brother Tim was the killer. To clear the Robert's name for his boss, Lieut. Rocky Lane heads south of the border posing as an outlaw. He hopes to get in with the gang and find Tim who is using an assumed name. As always, Nugget is there to help.
