Two-Eleven

 There are thieves among us... and then there are expert thieves. Blake Turner lives life on his own terms. He's talented, daring and rich. Little does anyone know he's actually a serial bank robber. He likes the adrenaline rush from pulling off high-tech bank heists. He also loves the lifestyle that comes along with the money. Rich Summerfield plays life by the rules. He's a hard-working family man. He's also the smartest detective on the police force. The two men find themselves on opposite sides of the law. Yet they're equally brilliant, determined and driven. Their paths are destined to collide, with explosive results.
