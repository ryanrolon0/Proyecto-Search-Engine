Roney's Point

 A West Virginia insane asylum and the surrounding area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania serve as the backdrop for this gritty, dark, psychological thriller. Death by electrocution, at the psychiatric institution, triggers a chain of events and the subsequent escape of four inmates; sets into motion a complex trail of murders with religious overtones, action, and intrigue, described by some, as SEVEN meets THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
