Survivre à Shanghai

 This film documents the experience of 20.000 Jews who fled Nazi persecution in Europe and took refuge in Shanghai, China, during World War II. For several thousands of them, escape meant travelling through the Soviet Union and Japan before eventually reaching Shanghai. Throughout the Japanese occupation the refugees were completely cut off from the outside world. After Shanghai was liberated, they began leaving for new homes in Europe, the United States, Israel and Australia.
