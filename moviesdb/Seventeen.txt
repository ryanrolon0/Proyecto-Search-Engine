Seventeen

 Willy Baxter is now 17, which is practically 18, so he prefers "William". William is supposed to be studying for college entrance exams, but a sophisticated Chicago girl arrives in town. She's the cat's meow with her singing, dancing, and big city catchphrases. "But definitely!" William doesn't have any money and his old jalopy won't impress anybody. His allowance is already up to $1 and his baby sister won't lend him any money from her piggy bank. But he needs a new car, and white tie, tails, and top hat so he can take the doll to the swank nightclub he's been told about. And she won't go anywhere without that dog of hers...
