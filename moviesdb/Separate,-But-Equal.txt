Separate, But Equal

 The story of HC Anderson, a black photograph in the Mississippi Delta, and of a black middle class community that existed in Greenville, Mississippi during legal segregation. This segregated southern town comes to life in Mr. Anderson's photographs. The film shows very rare images of African Americans in Mississippi during an era known most for civil strife. The film also tells the story of Shawn Wilson discovering HC Anderson, while searching for a master print of a photograph of his deceased mother. The old photographer gives the young filmmaker a new perspective on his view on Mississippi. Mr. Anderson's collection of photographs was acquired by the Smithsonian Institute, his legacy will be preserved.
