The Wrath

 In the mid 1800's a family fortune is hidden deep in a cave in what is now Griffith Park, CA and a terrifying netherworld beast is tasked to guard it. Forward to present day and the lone surviving heir goes in search encountering perils and dangers that lie in wait for her along the way. In 1863, the moribund Don Antonio Feliz is lured by his friend Don Coronel and signs his will giving his properties in Los Angeles to him before dying. His blind niece loses in court and curses Don Colonel, his lawyer Don Innocante, the judge and their families. On the present days, Antonio Feliz's descendant Angelina Feliz and her boyfriend Derek Blake accidentally find an ancient map where the family treasure is hidden in the Griffith Park. They ask their language arts professor John Diaz to translate the map, but the dishonest teacher steals the copy. With the stinky drifter George Abernathy, they locate where the fortune is.
