Rooted

 You can see the reef below you. You can see the swell surging towards you. You're staring death in the face and you have a split second to decide to pull back or to confront Mother Nature at her most powerful. This is the story of an average surfer-filmmaker's quest to paddle into the heaviest wave on the planet. By an unbelievable twist of fate, he met Maya Gabeira, a 19-year old Brazilian waitress who shared this common goal. Maya only learned to swim 5-years ago, but was determined to become a professional big wave surfer against all the odds. This film depicts a battle between the power of the mind and the wrath of nature. It's a journey of determination, discipline and focus, but also one of discovery.
