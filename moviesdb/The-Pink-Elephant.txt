The Pink Elephant

 Like most couples, Tyler and Melissa are happy. Their relationship is ready for the next step, the engagement - and an engagement party. It is every couple's obligation to parents, friends, family and even the occasional acquaintance. Tyler and Melissa have much to share with their new found families. Although the families also have much to offer, there is little that they are willing to take. Suppressed resentment and dissatisfaction for each other are manifested. The pink elephant is born. The unspoken obvious is materialized into human embodiment. The pink elephant's job is to be everywhere parents want nothing more than to see their daughter get married, except, as any parent believes, no one will be good enough for her. Tyler's parents see him as the apple of any parent's blind eye. Tyler and Melissa have much to offer beyond face value, yet parents and friends can often only see what is right in front of them. Welcome to their engagement party.
