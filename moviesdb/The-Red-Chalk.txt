The Red Chalk

 "A talented but destitute artist finds a red chalk. He quickly discovers that whatever he draws with it, becomes real. He nourishes his hunger then creates a dream environment for himself. Finally he draws the woman of his dreams, and she too appears. They laugh and dance and talk about being together forever. When they kiss, the woman suddenly breaks away. The artist gives chase, and falls into a cosmic canal where his 'rebirthing' begins. A neighbor finds the artist dead in his apartment. A drawing on the wall reveals the woman of his dreams carrying a baby, the artist. Explores the tortured mind of an artist and draws deeper questions about the relationship between creativity and rebirth." IN-SIGHT ezine
