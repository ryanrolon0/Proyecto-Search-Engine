Search & Destroy

 America is winning the war on terrorism. Navy SEALs aboard the USS Jimmy Carter are miniaturized and injected into the President's body as medical robots in a covert operation to Search and Destroy two terrorists known only as the Malignant and the Benign, who are spreading throughout her body like cancer. They have 24 hours to complete the surgery before their DNA reconstitutes and they become detected by the President's immune system that will make every attempt to destroy the ship.
