The Violin

 The Violin tells the story of David, a shy 17-year-old who falls in love with a girl named Judit in 1944 Hungary. When the Nazis invade, the two are separated, only to be reunited by fate in a concentration camp. Faced with unspeakable horrors, the two are in the end still teenagers, with their insecurities, their hopes and dreams, and their potential for extraordinary acts of love and bravery.
