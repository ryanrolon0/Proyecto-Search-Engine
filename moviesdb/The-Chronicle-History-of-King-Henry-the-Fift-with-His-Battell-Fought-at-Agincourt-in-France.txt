The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France

 In the inspired Olivier concept, Shakespeare's play begins as a performance in the Globe Theatre, shifting in broad cinematic terms to an epic narrative of Henry V, who had developed from a dissolute youth to a purposeful monarch. Proving his ability as a soldier and skillful leader, he unites the dissident factions in the English army and goes on to crush the French, against enormous odds, at Agincourt. Arranging a treaty with the French court, he woos Princess Katharine to whom he is formally betrothed as part of the peace agreement. Based on one the most popular historical plays by Shakespeare and made in order to boost moral of British troops during WW2, this movie is about English king Henry V and his military campaign in France in 1415.
