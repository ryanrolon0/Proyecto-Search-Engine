Teraz i zawsze

 "Now and Forever " is a film about a vocation, love, and faith. A vocation that falls suddenly on people who don't expecting it at all. A love, which begins with a feeling for a woman but then becomes something much more complex. A faith being so deep that is capable of changing a person's whole life. Together with Marcin, a seminarist and before that a student of the University of Physical Education, we get to know the hermetic world of a Seminary. A Seminary is a world on its own a world of silence, prayer and hard work in which closeness with a woman is a distant memory or an abstraction. Before Marcin joined the Seminary, he wanted to become a rescuer. However, climbing yet another rockface appeared to be easier than winning the heart of Marta, his friend. Everything changes when a pleading made by Marcin during his accidental visit to a charismatic Christian community is granted. Marcin goes through a transformation forcing him to start asking questions that he has never thought of before. Consecutive days spent in an old Cistercian abbey seem to awoke in him greater and greater doubts. Is the path he chose the right one? Everything is even more difficult since the outside world, that he abandoned, refuses to allow itself to be forgotten.
