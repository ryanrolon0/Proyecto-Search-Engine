The National Hollerin' Contest

 Every year on the third Saturday in June, thousands of people from all over the world gather in the sleepy little town of Spivey's Corner, North Carolina. There is an all day celebration of "hollerin'" a tradition of the American South that dates back hundreds of years. The purpose of hollerin' was to communicate across great distances, when family members need to be called in from the fields, or if someone wants to let the neighbors know they feel good this morning. Trophies are awarded to the top three winners in men's and women's division of hollerin'.
