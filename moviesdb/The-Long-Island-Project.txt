The Long Island Project

 A group of industrialists file for a movement to secede the region of Long Island (two counties and two boroughs) from New York to build the first socialist State of Long Island. Though smooth-sailing at first, the group doesn't quite understand the importance of their secession project until it's too late. They learn to deal with every aspect of putting together such a movement, including learning how to deal with the hard-core politics of modern-day New York--and the enemies it creates.
