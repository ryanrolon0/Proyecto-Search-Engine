Sisi auf Schloß Gödöllö

 In Sisi at Gödöllö Castle, Christian Frosch lustfully takes apart not only the empress and Heimatkino (Homeland Film), but also knows how to surprise one with the artful use of color, music and mimicry. Ursula Ofner plays the decadent ruler with wonderful self-exaggeration - on a background of green and orange, black and blood red. A symmetrical Heimat operetta full of self irony, which takes its color key from a Dürer Madonna, and is choreographed to every kind of bodily fluid.
