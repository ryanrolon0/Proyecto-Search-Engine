The Good Samaritan

 When Claire doesn't return on time from her yearly camping trip, intuition tells her sister Natalie that something has gone wrong. While desperately trying to find somebody who may have seen Claire, she stumbles into Paul, a good-natured man more than willing to help someone in need. But when they set out in search of Claire, it quickly becomes apparent that something far more sinister has been at work.
