The Overland Express

 It's 1861 and Buck gets the business men of Sacramento to establish the Pony express. Hawley runs the stage line over the same route and has the U. S. mail contract. When it looks like the Pony Express will be awarded the mail contract, he gives guns to the Indians and has them attack both the riders and the stations.
