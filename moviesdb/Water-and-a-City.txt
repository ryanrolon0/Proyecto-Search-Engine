Water and a City

 With growing urbanisation across India, many towns and cities are crying for more water. Is the shortage due to a lack of resources or due to poor management? Located in Bangalore, India's IT capital, the film traces the journey of water into and out of urban homes. Along this journey it looks at access to water for the poor, the politics of water pricing, urban India's continuous exploitation of natural resources and explores possible alternatives for a sustainable water future.
