The Adventures of Errol Flynn

 Documentary about action-adventure movie star 'Errol Flynn (I)' (qv). Flynn's early life was something out of an adventure novel. He lived in the South Seas, undertook major sailing expeditions and dabbled in a variety of business ventures. His first stab at acting was _In the Wake of the Bounty (1933)_ (qv), an Australian made film where, he admitted, he didn't have a clue what he was doing. He did repertory theater work in England for a time and eventually ended up under contract at Warner Bros. studios in Hollywood. Jack Warner personally selected him for the lead role in _Captain Blood (1935)_ (qv) which led to instant stardom. Similar roles, especially in _The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)_ (qv) made him the top action/adventure hero of his day. His career hit a major bump in the road when he was charged with statutory rape in 1943. He was found not guilty and there is a consensus that he was set up. His career began to decline by the late 1940s and in 1953, his contract with Warners came to an end. He continued to make the occasional film and appeared on television but years of hard living eventually caught with him. He died in 1959 at the of 50.
