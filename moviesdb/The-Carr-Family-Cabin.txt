The Carr Family Cabin

 "The Carr Family Cabin" is a short film celebrating the "Cracker" style cabin of renowned Florida naturalist, Archie Carr. The film vividly describes the creation and use of this cabin retreat built in the late 1930's after Archie's father, Pastor Archibald Carr and his wife moved to Umatilla, Florida. Constructed on the shores of Lake Nicotoon in the Ocala National Forest, the little cabin afforded three generations of Carrs a lasting relationship with an authentic Florida that tourists seldom see.
