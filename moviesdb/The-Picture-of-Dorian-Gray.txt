The Picture of Dorian Gray

 "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is faithfully based on Oscar Wilde's infamous novel about vanity and depravity set in London, England in the 1890's. Dorian Gray is a young man known for his kindness and innocence as well as his stunning looks. After sitting for a portrait by the great painter Basil Hallward, Dorian makes an impulsive wish. He vows to sell his soul if he could remain as he was the day the painting was finished and that the painting would bear the scars of aging and his sins. The wish comes true. Dorians initial horror gives way to a descent into greater and greater acts of depravity that culminates in the murder of the artist and Dorian's own destruction.
