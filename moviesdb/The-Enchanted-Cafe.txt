The Enchanted Cafe

 Here is a decided novelty. A restaurant scene opens to the view and a gentleman enters. The waiter walks up and takes his order. At each request from his customer he holds out his hand and the dishes and the food are mysteriously placed therein. He does not move out of sight of the audience, but by a mere wave of his hand the articles appear as if by magic. It will puzzle anybody to find out how this is done.
