 Jenny moves into her first apartment and soon begins to suspect that her neighbors may not be the all-American family that they appear to be. Fearing that 8-year-old Kimmy might be in danger, Jenny ignores the advice of her boyfriend and intervenes -- and finds that sometimes what you hear through the wall isn't nearly as frightening as what is actually there.
