Utopia Lies at the Horizon

 Millions of immigrants, for half a millennium, have arrived in New York City to escape poverty, to earn a living, or to just survive. To achieve the American dream, immigrants helped to build this country and for the most part evaded the temptations of easy money. Based on actual events, this short film describes the attempt of an immigrant who tried his best to make it in America. This story was created by combining anecdotes and quips from fellow immigrants who have succeeded, failed, or even died pursuing their dreams. The film is told with realistic dialog, mostly in Spanish, and relies mainly on visually striking images. By using actual New York City locations, we captured the authenticity and grittiness the story deserved.
