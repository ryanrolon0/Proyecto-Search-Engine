The Wager

 The Wager is a comedy with a tongue-in-cheek look at the Hollywood Film Industry. It stars Oscar nominee Burt Young (Chinatown, Rocky etc) as studio boss Jack Stockman who makes a bet with a hotshot independent producer. The Indie producer says that he can make a movie in three days, without a story or a script. The Wager follows the hapless crew of the film for the three days as they scurry up and down the California coast, trying to get the film "in the can" and win the bet.
