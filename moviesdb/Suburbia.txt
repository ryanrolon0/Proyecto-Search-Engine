Suburbia

 When Jeff moves into a quiet suburban neighborhood and begins to interact with the neighbors children showing them a world full of song and dance, an older religious woman (Kathryn) takes it upon herself to protect 'the little ones!' What ensues is a struggle for Jeff to gain acceptance before he is forced to leave forever.
