Self-Portait

 Utilizing old, black-and-white photos of several generations of my family, I have re-framed the images, creating an evolving, multiple layered image that is ambiguous, ethereal and at times, gruesome. The translucent portraits gradually but noticeably disappear to reveal a non-static image of myself, which from the beginning of the video has remained 'buried' beneath the layers. These faded images reveal my identity innumerable histories and memories have already passed and been forgotten, but they remain inside of me until I exist.
