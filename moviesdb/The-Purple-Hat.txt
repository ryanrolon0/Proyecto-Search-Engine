The Purple Hat

 New Orleans - The French Quarter - 1938. It rains heavily as a mysterious stranger walks into a bar and tells his story. He expects to see a woman murdered tonight. Again. He thinks she's a ghost, for he's seen her murdered twice. Each time by a young man...always a different young man... At the other end of the bar, the only other customer grows more and more tense, wary. He jumps up and bolts out...a young man.
