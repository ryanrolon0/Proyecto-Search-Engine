The Cariboo Trail

 While the gold fever is sweeping the Cariboo Region, extending from Kamloops to Prince George, of British Columbia in western Canada, a man heads up into the region with his herd of cattle, because he thinks he can make even more money by rearing animals in the fine pastures. However, his traveling companion turns against him and a local tycoon opposes his plans, leading to a bloody gunfight during which all is resolved.
