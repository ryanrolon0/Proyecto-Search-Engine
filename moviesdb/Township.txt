Township

 Mark has written his first novel, it was successful, and he has skipped out on college and has been living in Philadelphia for the past 3 to 4 years. After encountering severe writer's block and endless pitch rejections from his agent and publishers, he returns home to Southern New Jersey to try to get back his inspiration. He gets more than he bargained for.
