Shteps

 It's "Best in Show" meets "Strictly Ballroom" via "Kids in the Hall". It's a unique movie filled with surprises. It's a dance-comedy about mouth guards. It's an anti-drug story that's funny. It's charming and independent and everything Hollywood is not. It's Steps, a film that draws its inspiration from the Marx Brother to Monty Python and it was done on such a shoe-string budget, it would make a studio executive blush.
