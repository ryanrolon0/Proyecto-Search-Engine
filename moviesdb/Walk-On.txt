Walk On

 A touching documentary that showcases the stars (the kids) success in the hippotherapy program -- from the beginning to as far as performing and winning in the Special Olympics. Hippotherapy is a physical, occupational and speech therapy treatment strategy that utilizes equine movementHippotherapy is utilized as part of an integrated treatment program to achieve functional outcomes. In hippotherapy, the patient engages in activities on the horse that are enjoyable and challenging. In the controlled hippotherapy environment, the therapist modifies the horse's movement and carefully grades sensory input. Specific riding skills are not taught (as in therapeutic horseback riding); but rather a foundation is established to improve neurological function and sensory processing. This foundation can be generalized to a wide range of daily activities.
