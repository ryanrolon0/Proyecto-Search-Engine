The Daring Project

 The Daring Project is an intimate and provocative portrait of five dancers who were principles in the most esteemed ballet companies in the world, and who are in a fight against time. Most are in their mid thirties - old by the standards of ballet companies. Several have had serious injuries. The documentary focuses on the creation and World Premiere of a controversial piece, " For Ella", set to four Ella Fitzgerald songs. This Premiere will re-launch the career of one dancer - and, in a heart breaking moment, end another.
