Sides

 Four filmmakers discover they've 'blown' almost all the money they'd borrowed (from a local loan shark) to produce a film. Desperate, they come up with a plan to film anyway - using the audition tape footage as the actual movie. With each audition they must con the actors into doing more and more in order to succeed at putting together a feature that their gangster benefactor will appreciate.
