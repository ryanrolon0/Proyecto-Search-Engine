Some Holiday

 Three couples, three different experiences. College sweethearts, who truly love and understand each other, but find themselves pressured by the reality of marriage. Two men, partners in their relationship, but their world view and priorities are at opposite ends. And an actress and a musician, who came together out of passion and desire to create, only to become frustrated about the path they end up on. The thread that binds all these lives together is the concept, and very real existence of a child.
