Rotunda

 A portrait of the 'Rotunda,' designed by Thomas Jefferson to represent 'the authority of nature and the power of reason,' that combines its timeless majesty with the ever-changing hum of daily life. Sounds and images recorded over the course of a year are presented as a single day from dawn to sunset.
