Roll the Dice

 Hustlebot, Pittsburgh's best comedy troupe (and tallest and sexiest), wins a script writing contest with a script about a comedy troupe entering a script writing contest. After winning, they struggle with the idea of "raising the stakes" of their story, by betting the prize money, just like in the script.
