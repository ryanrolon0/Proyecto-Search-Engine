The Bigtop

 Vincent O'Malley endures a home life on the prairie under the oppressive eyes of his father. The arrival of a circus in Vincent's home town leads Vincent to run away. Vincent assumes the role of a clown, but realizes that his new family is in need of an audience and the muscle and daring to acquire it. Vincent leads his friends in missions to gather crowds to the circus tent. The arrival of a young girl, however, sets Vincent on edge as he begins to suspect that those around him are thwarting the acquisition of his true love. As jealousy leads to a precipice of loneliness and annihilation, Vincent must come to a reckoning with his true nature and with his place in the universe.
