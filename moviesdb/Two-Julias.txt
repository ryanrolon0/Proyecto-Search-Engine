Two Julias

 Counter-terrorism Agent Frank Armstrong has a problem - his girlfriend Lillian is obsessed with spying on single women. Thanks to the Patriot Act, what pleases Lil, pleases Frank. Watched by suspicious agents from around the world, Frank and Lillian kick their spying up a notch with Julia Carter. Julia's first meeting with Dave, supposedly single Seattle salesman, will be a little coffee and conversation. Frank and Lillian turn the awkward first date upside down, but the clock is ticking.
