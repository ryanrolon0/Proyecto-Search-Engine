The Crawlspace

 Mike wakes up to find that he is trapped and it soon becomes blatantly obvious that there is no way out. A phone rings and the games begin. The captor calls himself "The Director" as he claims to be directing a reality show in which your life is truly in danger. The show will last 3 days, and Mike will be given several random tasks to complete. If Mike is alive at the end of the third day, he will be free. But as the first task ensues, Mike realizes surviving might take more than he has.
