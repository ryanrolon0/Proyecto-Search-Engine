President and Prince at Washington

 The scene opens showing one of the large public buildings at Washington. The different officials are seen to emerge therefrom and entering carriages, are driven away. Near the end, President Roosevelt and the Prince of Prussia enter their carriage followed by Admiral Evans and others. This is a perfect film.
