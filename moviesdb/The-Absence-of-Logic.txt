The Absence of Logic

 Musician Bobby Queen has hit rock bottom, overindulging on any sedative he can get his hands on. The reason for his self destructive pattern is a dark and twisted story only he can tell. From a jaded and drug induced perspective, we travel through the mind of a paranoid and highly dangerous manic depressive, as he moves us through the stages of his life revealing the picture perfect life he has lost. Dealing with the inconsistencies and deterioration of his mind, Bobby makes his last stand in a self induced cell of a motel room where he falls victim to his own illogical behavior.
