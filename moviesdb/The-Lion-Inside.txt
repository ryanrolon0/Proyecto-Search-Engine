The Lion Inside

 Set against the backdrop of illegal logging and wildlife poaching in contemporary Central Africa, The Lion Inside is a pulse-pounding action-adventure about a former British Army officer who, with the assistance of a ragtag team of ex pat mercenaries, must rescue his kidnapped activist wife from the clutches of a corrupt international logging conglomerate she is trying to expose.
