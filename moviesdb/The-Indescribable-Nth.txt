The Indescribable Nth

 Scott, a lonely man who runs a near-bankrupt shop that sells nothing but those glass domes that you shake and snow swirls around a snowman or the Eiffel Tower, prays for a son. That night someone leaves Eric, a foundling, on his doorstep, and Scott raises the boy. To cheer baby Eric, Scott shakes a glass dome with a red heart; the boy is delighted, and Scott is delighted with his son's delight. Both share the indescribable nth. When Eric becomes a youth, he finds this same ecstasy with Doris, but when she breaks his heart, he locks it away in a safe, believing his father that women are nuts. When a woman named Otis comes along, should he open the safe?
