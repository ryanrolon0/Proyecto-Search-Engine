The Ordinary Boy

 A small boy leaves his house early in the morning and walks up into the hills and a beautiful meadow, where he has a spiritual experience. As he sits in the meadow "the trees turn to sunshine and everything got real bright". He thinks he might have seen God. But when he tries to explain his vision to his Dad, Mom, Aunt, and Sunday School Teacher they discount his experience because he is just an ordinary boy.
