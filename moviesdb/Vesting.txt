Vesting

 Willa Voit is living the life most only dream of having; a family mansion that reaches up into the blue sky like a fairy tale castle, a loving husband who brings home flowers after work and a beautiful four year old daughter who is mature beyond her years. But this photogenic household is all but picture perfect, and one morning, something changes. In this story of desperate impossibility, writer/director D. Mason Bendewald explores the true depths of the human spirit and the strain that hope can have on one's own reality. If hope is what dreams are made of, when is it time to leave those dreams behind?
