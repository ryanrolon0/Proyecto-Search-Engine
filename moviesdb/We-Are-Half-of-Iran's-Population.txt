We Are Half of Iran's Population

 A loose follow-up to Our Times, Bani-Etemad's documentary short was made during the months before last year's controversial elections in Iran. Filming a diverse coalition of women's rights activists discussing their opinions on pressing contemporary issues, Bani-Etemad asked three of the four presidential candidates to view the footage for comment, with Mahmoud Ahmedinejad declining to participate. A number of the activists seen in the film were later arrested in the post-election protests.
