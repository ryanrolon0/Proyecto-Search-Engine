The Backwards Rider

 Riding 'is a freedom, it's like tapping into a world that has never been tapped into,' states Leslie Slowely at the beginning of the film, 'The Backwards Rider.' Recycled art and bicycling are the inspiration that drives this Jamaican native and Toronto resident. What makes a man decide to bicycle backwards everywhere he goes for the rest of his life?
