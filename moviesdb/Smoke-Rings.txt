Smoke Rings

 An homage to the great comics from the silent-era of cinema, 'Smoke Rings' follows the efforts of an affable, yet hapless chap, as he tries to impress the beautiful lady that has caught his eye at the neighborhood speakeasy. Standing in his way, however, is a licentious rival and a bartender with really bad timing.
