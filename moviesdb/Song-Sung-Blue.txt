Song Sung Blue

 SONG SUNG BLUE is the alternately inspiring and tragic love story of Lightning & Thunder, a homegrown Milwaukee husband & wife singing duo who pay tribute to the music of Neil Diamond. For Mike and Claire Sardina, aka Lightning & Thunder, dreams are the fuel and music the engine of life. SONG SUNG BLUE goes behind the curtain with this brave couple, from their humble beginnings over 20 years ago to the threshold of fame, from disaster to rebirth through to the final chapters in the lives of these authentic American dreamers.
