The Secret

 The Secret is a film about the themes of isolation and frustration, told through the experience of a teenage boy during what appears to be a normal day at school. The film begins with the familiar and routine start of a school day - a school bus pulls up, feet march to class, books are placed on desks. For David, his late arrival distinguishes him from the others, a distinction that frustratingly continues in class as his teacher and classmates appear to ignore him. Young Rosie offers David some clues and tells him of a secret that he must figure out for himself. She warns him of sinister others who might try to prevent him finding out. His frustrations reach boiling point before David comes face to face with his darkest imaginings. As he flees the school in fear he finally realizes the true horror of the secret.
