Waking Up the Town

 A young girl visits her grandfather, who owns an auto repair shop. She falls in love with his handsome assistant, who is also an engineer trying to talk the town banker into financing his plans to harness the power of a nearby waterfall. All that may be for naught, though--her grandfather, an amateur astronomer, has discovered that the world will end because the Earth is being pulled out of its orbit and will crash into the moon.
