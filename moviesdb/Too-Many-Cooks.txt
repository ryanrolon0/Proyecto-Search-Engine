Too Many Cooks

 Two young lovers are building their house, but their relatives don't stop interfering, finally cutting off the young man's income and alienating them, but he is impressing everybody by continuing working at his home. Al Bennett and Alice Cook are blissfully happy and are building their house in an isolated area, using Al's savings of $7,000. Troubles begin when Al's uncle and boss, Uncle George, unaware of Al's engagement, inspects the house and announces he will live with him. Furthermore, he wants Al to marry Minnie Spring, a wonderful girl George just met, so the three of them can live happily ever after. Troubles mount when Alice's parents come to see the partially built house. They bring with them eleven other family members, some of whom expect to live with the couple when they marry. Badgered on all sides, Al finally yells "There's too many Cooks." Alice breaks their engagement, and George fires him. As if these problems weren't enough, the Carpenter's Union calls a strike, but a determined Al decides to finish the house himself. Months later, lonely and depressed, Al puts his finished house up for sale, but things are looking up for Al.
