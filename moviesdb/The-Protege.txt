The Protege

 A young vampire is sent out on a mission to find a victim. He spots an innocent potential victim in a bar and entrances her with his gaze. On his journey back he is overcome with blood lust but is interrupted before he can bite. They approach the vampire lair, when the young victim witnesses the master bite another victim and manages to escape and seek refuge in the protection of a church yard. She awakes at dawn but not all is as it seems.
