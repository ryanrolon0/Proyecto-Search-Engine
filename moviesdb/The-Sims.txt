The Sims

 "The Sims" is a close up look at a family of Will Wright's critically acclaimed "Sim City" series. In this game you create a family of "Sims" and build a house for them on the lot they are put on. As the game progresses, your Sims lives take a turn for better or worse. You get jobs and earn money, buy equipment to increase your skills, make friends with other Sims, fall in love and get married and ultimately have a bouncing baby Sim. However, disasters do strike in the Sim world; pipes can burst and start floods, fires can break out and burn up things, you can get robbed by burglars, and if not properly taken care of; your Sims can starve to death. The game includes many real-life aspects as realistically as possible. Who knows? Maybe your Sims will finally be able to buy that Plasma Vision Widescreen TV some day... From the creator of Sim City, the Sims was born, and it took the world by storm. In The Sims, you can create a sim, or a whole family of sims if you choose, and you must help them through their needs. You need them to get a house-or you can custom build one-you need them to get a job, eat, sleep, have fun, and even build up various skills, including cooking and mechanical skills. However, in the Sims world, just as you can imagine, things aren't always simple. Real life problems such as fires, floods and even thefts occur. And your Sim, through all this, can get married, have a baby, and you can control them, keeping their needs satisfied, and keeping their lives happy and comfortable-or you could really make a mess of things and see what happens then!! It's all up to you-your in control in the realistic world of the Sims, designed by Will Wright-just remember-your in control!!
