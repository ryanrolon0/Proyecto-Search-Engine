Therapy

 On the verge of despair, a frightened Theresa enters into a new kind of Intensive therapy. Seduced by Victor Suave, she sells her rights for one last chance at freedom. Left alone in a room with a seemingly perfect version of herself, she realizes that this form of therapy doesn't involve the conventional sit down session; it's kill or be killed. Theresa must learn that she is ultimately stronger than she gives herself credit for, before her personified hatred gets the upper hand and Theresa is lost forever.
