The Fighting Lawman

 Deputy U. S. Marshal Jim Burke, stationed in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1886, follows the trail of four bank robbers and catches one of them, Manuel Jackson, when Manuel's horse goes lame. The other three, Slade, Clark and Martin, escape. Three years later Manuel is shot by Burke while attempting a prison break and, before he dies, Manuel reveals that his sister, Raquel, living in Prescott, knows the identity of his three bank-robber partners, now in Prescott using assumed names. Burke contacts Raquel who agrees to help him spot and capture the outlaws. Instead, she double-crosses Burke and attempts to blackmail the trio, one of whom, Slade, she is engaged to. As Burke and Sheriff Dave Wilson close in, Raquel and Slade plan to take the stolen money, kill Burke, Clark and Martin, and escape. In the showdown all the outlaws are killed, together with Raquel, shot by Clark as she attempts to rob Clark's safe. When four men rob a bank, Marshal Burke catches one who gives the nanes of the others and asks Burke to protect his sister. He finds the sister but the others are using assumed names. As he tries to locate them and retrieve the money, she knows who they are and is plotting to get the money for herself.
