The Animated Poster

 Shows an old house in the background with one window with the shutters closed. A bill poster comes along and puts up a poster advertising a burlesque show. When his work is finished the picture of an actress in tights is seen on the building. The poster is so placed that when the shutters are opened, the head of the picture is cut off. An old maid in the house is annoyed by the noise made by the bill-poster and opens the shutters to remonstrate. When the shutters are opened the old maid's head appears in such a position as to make it seem that the head of the figure on the poster had come to life. This amuses the passersby, but the bill-poster, not wishing the advertising part of the bill cut from view forces the shutters closed and again plasters paste on them. Suddenly they are thrown open again and the old maid throws a pail of water on her tormentor, who falls over into his paste tub.
