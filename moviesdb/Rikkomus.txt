Rikkomus

 Voluntarily imprisoned in a love nourished by dependency and jealousy, the Finnish tango singer, Helena, sees suddenly the possibility that her destiny can take a new route. Helena sees the long absence of her husband as a new way to live out desires she never knew before. But her destiny will offer her something else than the satisfaction of these new longings.
