Things to Do

 An unstable and indifferent office worker, Adam Stevenson, decides to leave his job and escape to his childhood home to reevaluate his "life strategy". Upon his return, Adam is greeted by the under concern of his baby boom parents and quickly aligns with the lazy comforts of his backyard, yearning for a summer of sulk and solitude. A chance encounter at the grocery store reunites him with Mac, an unusual acquaintance from his past who acts as the perfect catalyst for Adam to turn the wheel of change and rebirth. Together the underachieving duo set out to complete a "Things To Do" list, a collection of bizarre aspirations plucked from the gaps of an incomplete adolescence.
