The Michigan Kid

 Jim Rowan, after his discharge from the U.S. Calvary at the end of the Sioux Wars, seeks peace and security on an Arizona cattle ranch. But his arrival coincides with an outbreak of lawlessness. He calls in three ex-soldier buddies, Buster, Steve Prescott and Dave Boyd, to help him combat the outlaw faction and bring peace and prosperity to the territory.
