 This Documentary is about a 34 Samurai (who were also known as The Last Samurais) delegation sent by the Japanese government to France at the end of Edo era. They were sent to help solve diplomatic problems between Japan and Europe on December 29th, 1863. At the time,Japan closed all of its ports. The Samurai were welcomed by every government they visited,including Napoleon III, in France. They were also photographed standing in front of Sphinx, in Egypt. The Samurai brought back lots of products from their trip including a book on producing wine. They ended their expedition earlier than expected due to the need to report home about the astonishing technology in modernizing countries.
