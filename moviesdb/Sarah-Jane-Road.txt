Sarah Jane Road

 A married couple, David and Lindsey, are driving home from a weekend vacation away. They are in high spirits until a violent storm threatens to make their commute home a little less pleasant. As a result, traffic stops and they decided to skip the highway in favor of some back roads near where Lindsey grew up. But all is not right. Radio announcements warn of an escaped mental patient who is armed and dangerous, and Lindsey's own fear and possible insecurities from her childhood cause her to bring up the deadly ghost that is the roads name sake. In the torrential downpour and darkness they get lost. Stuck in the middle of nowhere in the dark and rain, they are left alone with their own paranoia and fear. Two basic instincts that can impair reason and cause things to go bump in the night that may or may not be there. Two basic instincts are all that's left on Sarah Jane Road.
