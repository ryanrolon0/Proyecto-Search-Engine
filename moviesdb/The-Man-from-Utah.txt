The Man from Utah

 The Marshal sends John Weston to a rodeo to see if he can find out who is killing the rodeo riders who are about to win the prize money. Barton has organized the rodeo and plans to leave with all the prize money put up by the townspeople. When it appears that Weston will beat Barton's rider, he has his men prepare the same fate for him that befell the other riders. In a horse-riding rodeo contest bad guys want John Weston to lose. When he doesn't go along they add some insurance saddle.
