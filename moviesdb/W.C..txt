W.C.

 W.C. centers on the trials and tribulations of two toilet attendants as they deal with argumentative customers, an interfering bar manager, hapless losers and grimy toilets. Jack Watts' dad had him arrested when his gambling problem got out of hand and he dipped his hand in the till of the family bar once too often. Just out of prison, he is told that the toilet attendant's job in the bar has just become vacant; Jack will work there until the money he took is paid back. Katya, who works as the attendant in the girls' toilet, is given the task of showing Jack the ropes. Jack and Katya are both trapped in their jobs. Jack, because of his debt to his family; Katya, on account of her illegal status. She is reluctant to trust him at first, as everyone she has ever met has wanted something from her, but slowly Jack and Katya begin to build a friendship.
