The Greatest Adventure Yet

 This film chronicles the very first day of kindergarten for our little ones...but this is no ordinary classroom ex-Olympic hopeful trying to incorporate her love of gymnastics into the workload. This doesn't come cheap...before she will let the children so much as jump on the trampoline, Mrs. Montoya demands a check for $50 each! Only one child has the money, and this puts Mrs. Montoya into a very bad mood for the rest of the day. This film shows some of the firsts in the lives of kindergartners, and the friendships that can be made through all the weirdness that is school.
