The Backyard Broadcast

 A boy calling himself Major Bones holds a talent show called Major Bones Amateurs, the show performed in his back yard by and for his adolescent friends. Among the acts are singers, dancers, gymnasts, and an impersonator. Being the emcee, Major Bones has the power to pull acts that just don't make the grade. But he also gets an offer for his acts to turn professional, and another offer to go into a joint venture in having the show play in a nightclub type venue. A kid who calls himself Major Bones gathers neighborhood talent in the yard back of houses on Long Island. After a couple of performances, he gets a telegram offering 75 cents if he'll bring his revue to Oswald's place. Another kid offers a 50-50 deal if Bones will take his amateurs to the "Kiddie Revue" Nightclub. The scene shifts to the imaginary club where the young impresario introduces child performers to a packed house of kids dressed as grown ups. The acts feature ringlets and tap shoes, the songs range from "Polly Wolly Doodle" to "Cielito Lindo." By the end of the revue, does Bones have a deal?
