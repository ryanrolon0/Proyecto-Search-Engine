 "The Memory" is a warm love story between Film, a superstar who has lost his memory and Jaa, a paparazzi photographer who follows him, snapping shots of Film to sell to the magazines. They meet up somewhere in the North of Thailand, surrounded by the Thai jungle, hill tribes people and romantic scenery. The enemies end up falling in love...until Film gets his memory back....After this, he is unable to recognize the girl he met in the North. All of his memories about her are blurred, and he believes she's waiting for him somewhere far far away.
