The Masquerade Bandit

 A young girl, Molly Marble, is enmeshed in a train robbery by her crooked step-father. She meets a stranger, Jeff Morton, and suspects he knows where the loot is hidden. For the sake of her relatives, she must try to 'vamp' this information from him but, instead, she falls in love with him.
