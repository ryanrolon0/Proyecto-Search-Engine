Salad Days

 An average life for an average guy. Working, drinking, and going to punk rock shows. His name is Sullivan Graham.. And after being betrayed by two of the people whom he is closest to, he must fight his way through it. It takes a hospital trip and two friendships on the rocks, which ultimately leads him to cling to a strikingly perverse mindset you have.
