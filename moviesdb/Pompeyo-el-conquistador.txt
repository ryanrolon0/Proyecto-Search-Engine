Pompeyo el conquistador

 Don Pompeyo is a funny man, who loves women and spending all he gets. Froilán is a formal man, and humorless. Everybody believes that Pompeyo and Froilán are brothers, though it is interesting they had never been seen together. Actually, they are the same person, who changes his personality each time he drinks a bottle of wine, and gets in trouble under both personalities. After many comic episodes, all becomes clear, and the truth is revealed.
