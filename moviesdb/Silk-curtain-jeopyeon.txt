Silk curtain jeopyeon

 A man and woman are separated by only a silk curtain and cannot see each other clearly. The man withdraws into himself dwelling among his fantasies of the woman he cannot see and in reality becoming more and more unresponsive. The woman, outgoing to begin with, starts losing control of her emotions and is at the verge of hysteria.
