The Umbrella Men

 This story is about a troupe of minstrels "The Umbrella Men" who compete every year in Cape Town's Street carnival. Their charismatic leader KHALED, has a fierce rivalry with TARIEK, a dodgy businessman who runs the more affluent 'Maulers'.   Khaled's nightclub sponsors 'The Umbrella Men', Tariek knows that without the club, the troupe will no longer be a threat so come competition time, he pulls strings to get the club closed down.   No club, No Umbrella Men, No reason for living. So Khaled is forced to get 'creative' and decides to rob the local bank during the chaos of the carnival. The city grinds to a halt when the carnival is on as thousands of tourists flock to the parade, creating havoc for the police department.   Whilst scoping out the bank, Khaled meets and falls hard for KEISHA who is employed at the bank. This relationship is at first seen as an advantage for the robbers but later turns out to have more serious consequences and becomes a pivotal aspect of the plot.   Using the noise of the big brass bands and general chaos on the streets, 'The Umbrella Men' tunnel their way into the local bank that is located at the starting point of the carnival. The plan is relatively simple-for thieves, but these guys are musicians!   So with their faces painted and dressed in brightly coloured uniforms 'The Umbrella Men' seem to have the perfect plan and alibi. But Tariek has other plans as he creates every imaginable obstacle to prevent Khaled and his troupe of musicians from succeeding.
