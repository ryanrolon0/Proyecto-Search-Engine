The Appointment

 Meet Jaime; a neurotic and endearing columnist who is waiting to see a doctor. Meet Dr. Ferguson; an easygoing and amiable doctor who walks in to perform Jamie's physical exam. Jamie is mortified; Dr. Ferguson is confused. Awkwardness ensues at full speed given that they are not strangers and went out on a date a couple weeks earlier. Jamie eventually lets him examine her and the whole misunderstanding is cleared up. A prescription is written and a second chance delivered.
