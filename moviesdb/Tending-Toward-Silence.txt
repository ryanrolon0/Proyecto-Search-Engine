Tending Toward Silence

 Set in the Yukon, Canada, Tending Toward Silence weaves a story of three different moments for a very special purpose and another reality both mysterious and sustaining. The film proposes that mental and imaginary realities can become more substantial than the physical reality. It bridges the world between life and death and suggests that our last journey has possibilities that we may not have considered.
