Sista bussen

 In Henrik's world problems do not exist. It's a world so well organized that he even gives lectures about it. One day, after holding a lecture in a small town, Henrik misses the last bus home. It now becomes impossible to deny the existence of his problems. As if that wasn't enough, the following morning he is supposed to meet his Internet date for the first time.
