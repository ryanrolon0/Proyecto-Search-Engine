Super Snoopers

 Mr. Poutndoubt is trying to mess things up for the townspeople of Wellsley again. This time he has sent Dr. Heckle, the dastardly dealer of pride to make the fine citizens of Wellsley boast about their accomplishments, instead of being humble and kind to one another. It's up to Burt and Squirt to figure out how to save the townspeople (and themselves!) from this Menacing Medical Man!
