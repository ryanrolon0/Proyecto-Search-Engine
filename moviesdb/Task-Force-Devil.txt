Task Force Devil

 We can't tell you their names or show their faces but we can show you what they do down Taliban warlords, uncovering vast caches of weapons, unleashing a fury of firepower and destroying hundreds of tons of ammunition and rockets. This is a rare look inside US Special Forces at War. For their protection they depend on their guns and their wits. Intelligence is everything. It leads them to find the bad guys and it protects them. It's all about winning the hearts and minds.
