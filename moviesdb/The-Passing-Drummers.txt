The Passing Drummers

 It's about an emotionally and physically abused woman struggling with prophetic dreams. It's about a gay man who feels the world has turned its back on him. It's about a simple southern man trying to be a good husband while dealing with an unflattering past. It's about a housewife who searches for an identity, knowing she has more to offer the world. Before them lays a path to each other and to a destined fight to save humanity from a fatal disease.
