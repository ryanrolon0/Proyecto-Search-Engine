Salam ya Salam

 Is it possible to turn problems into shapes? Salam is in his graduation year from the cinema institute , he's depressed for not being able to do his project the way he wants , he's genie pops out from his cup of coffee , he reminds him of his girlfriend who loves ,he takes him back to his childhood , he escapes from his story to another without saying "once upon time".
