Toddstock

 In June of 2008, rock icon Todd Rundgren opened up his home and invited 300 fans for a Utopian Camporee on his Kauai property. For more than a week together, they built a community, cooking, connecting and celebrating. Witness Todd, family and fans bless his new home, experience the island, celebrate his 60th birthday, and share the debut performance of a new recording, 'Arena.' Each night, they came together for a new experience, each day a new adventure. Todd and Michele Rundgren host this intimate and personal look at themselves, and the devoted fans who came from around the world to join him in celebration.
