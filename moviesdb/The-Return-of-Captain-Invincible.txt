The Return of Captain Invincible

 In WWII, Captain Invincible used his superpowers against the Nazis, and he was a hero. But when they accused him of supporting the communists, he retired to Australia. Now, after a US super secret super weapon is stolen, he's asked to come back, to help. Unfortunately, he's an alcoholic now... -- parody of superhero comic strips.
