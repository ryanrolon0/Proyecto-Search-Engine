The Teenage Kevorkian

 Tom and Jerry, Judge Judy's identical twins, were kidnapped by Jimmy the Pimp seeking revenge on his sentence. They were raised in the desert by a teenage hooker with no human contact. She abandoned them to die at age of ten. Tom was rejected by his real mother upon their return. He found refuge in the homeless society and mentored by a homeless vagrant. There he learned how to love and relieve pain forever.
