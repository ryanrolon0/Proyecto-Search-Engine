 Plum Flower, set in rural China in 1948, confronts a poor family with the birth of their fifth daughter. Poverty demands from the parents to poison the baby-girl, but the mother is desperately fighting for an alternative to keep her daughter alive. Plum Flower explores the importance of choosing a meaningful name for a child and how a child's name can establish and affect its identity. The film is based on the personal story of the director's mother and at the same time portrays a dark chapter of true Chinese History.
