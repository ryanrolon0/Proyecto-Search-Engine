The Last Dragon Kingdom

 This short film is a meditation on the nature of change and the Buddhist precept of impermenance. A visual journey through the ancient Kingdom of Bhutan, a Buddhist country experiencing dramatic changes in their society. This film is a metaphor for the rest of us in the Global Village. How can we embrace change consciously and learn from this brave little country the ways to balance our needs and desires as we navigate this changing, evolving world? Hopefully this film might encourage all of us to ask the same important question facing Bhutan
