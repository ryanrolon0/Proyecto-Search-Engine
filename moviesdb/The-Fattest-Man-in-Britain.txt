The Fattest Man in Britain

 Georgie Godwin, housebound for 23 years,is the fattest man in Britain, a tourist attraction, thanks to greedy 'agent', cabbie Morris who brings visitors to Rochdale to hear Georgie sing and - rather to his annoyance - touch him. Devoted neighbour Janice is Georgie's only other regular outside contact until he meets Amy, a pregnant teenager fleeing a violent boyfriend ,whom he takes in as a lodger. Touched by his kindness she feels he demeans himself and wants him to lose weight for his own safety. Morris, however, encourages Georgie to pile on the pounds as a money-spinner for them both, arranging for him to take part in a local television weigh-in, to see if he is fatter than rival claimant Big Brian. Amy is horrified but Georgie sees it as almost a calling. Will he beat Brian or will tragedy strike the fattest man in Britain?
