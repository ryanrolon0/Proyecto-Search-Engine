The Best of Colin's Sleazy Friends

 Colin and Dino are two guys who were clerks in the adult film section of a Los Angeles video store, and they got to know various porn stars and other industry types, in addition to some rock stars, actors, etc. They started their own talk show on L.A. public access TV about the adult film industry, where they would interview porn stars, go behind the scenes on the sets of porn movies, and try to keep from getting arrested when some of the porn stars decided to get crazy on the show.
