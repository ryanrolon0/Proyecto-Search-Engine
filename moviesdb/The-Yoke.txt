The Yoke

 It's the near future, and an elderly man looks for a new body to extend his life. In order to do this, he makes a deal with the local body merchant; Fafnir and his associate Krutzchne. Fafnir runs a smooth business using products, 'without any ties to society...' at least until Najva arrives, a woman searching for her daughter. Najva, addicted to youth inducing substances, sold her daughter to Krutzchne. Amongst the tension between business partners, shots are fired, and Najva reveals her true intentions for her retrieving her daughter.
