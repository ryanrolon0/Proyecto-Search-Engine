The Genius of Lenny Breau

 The Genius of Lenny Breau is Hughes' film biography of her father, the Canadian jazz guitar genius who died under mysterious circumstances in 1984. Through making the documentary, Hughes discovered the life of a father she never knew. This documentary explores and celebrates the all-too-short, heartbreaking but triumphant life and unworldly talent of Lenny Breau, considered by many to have been the greatest guitar player of all time. Long before the term "fusion" was coined, Lenny was melting musical boundaries to produce original pieces that borrowed from styles as diverse as jazz, classical and flamenco. Through a combination of never-before-seen archival footage and interviews with family and colleagues, viewers are offered a close-up look at a sensitive, selfless but flawed musical genius who redefined what the guitar could do.
