The Star Boarder

 Charlie stays at a boarding-house, where he is the landlady's favorite. Her husband grows jealous when observing this. Their little son has a camera. He happens to take some photos of his mother and Charlie in situations which are innocent but look indecent. He also takes a photo of his father and a female boarding-guest in a similar situation. In the evening the boy arranges a slide show in the boarding-house. Suddenly also the equivocal photos of his parents appear on the screen. His jealous father gets furious and starts chasing Charlie. Soon all the boarding-guests are involved in the fight. Charlie is the favorite of his landlady, and the other boarders are jealous. He cares for her after she falls from a ladder. Her son photographs what looks like an amorous moment. He next photographs his father in a similar situation with another woman. That evening the boy puts on a slide show for the guests, resulting in a battle between Charlie and his landlady's husband.
