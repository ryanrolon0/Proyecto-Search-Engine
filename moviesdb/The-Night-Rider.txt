The Night Rider

 Tim is the boss of a trail-herding crew consisting of Kentucky, a cook who plays the guitar, Joe, and Marty, a young, impressionable cowhand who longs for the glamorous life of a gunfighter. While the four cowhands sing around the campfire, a night-riding gunfighter named Johnny Laredo happens upon their camp, and joins them for a cup of coffee. He then rides on, leaving Marty wishing he could go with him. In the saloon in Bracketville Johnny Laredo is accosted at the bar by a drunken, young cowboy, Billy Joe. Roxy, the saloon singer, shames Billy Joe by calling him a boy, and in an effort to prove himself a man he draws on Laredo. Laredo is faster and kills him but Laredo's life is immediately changed as he is revolted at what he had to do. He attends the boy's funeral where the service is preached and a hymn sung by the circuit-riding Preacher. Laredo rides back to the camp of the trail herders and joins them, knowing his influence can sway Marty away from the life of a gunfighter. The patrons of a late-19th Century America theater flock to see the latest production, a Western tale of redemption. Johnny Laredo, a middle-aged gunfighter fleeing his many enemies by traveling at night, stops briefly at the campfire of Tim Dawson's team of cattle drivers for a cup of coffee and a bit of human companionship. Dawson offers Laredo a job, but Laredo is afraid to return to Wyoming where he killed a number of men. Stopping in a small Texas town for supplies before heading across the Mexican border, the gunfighter is forced to fight a inexperienced youngster trying to make a reputation and kills him. Even though he is acquitted, the gunfighter has had enough and returns to Dawson, accepts the job, and hopefully, the opportunity for redemption.
