The Horseman

 Set against the epic backdrop of post-Revolutionary War America, The Horseman chronicles the arrival of Jacob Quinn, an unknown outsider to a remote village in the New England wilderness. The townspeople greet him with curiosity and suspicion. Equally as mysterious as the man are the contents of his satchel. He is only welcomed in by Abigail Cooper the daughter of an old war comrade who Jacob must see for an urgent yet unknown purpose. Is it mercy or malice that he brings? Whatever secrets he may hold only seem to draw the village and it's residents ever closer to his mysterious past.
