Remmer

 When Sonny, a narcoleptic, tells a ghost story to his fiancEe, Addie, at a camping trip - he unknowingly slips into an altered state where he unleashes his darkest desires. Sonny's tale comes alive. Kidnapped and held captive in a sleep disorder clinic, they meet Dizzy, the "Drill-Bit-Girl" who has not slept for 16 days and a cast of offbeat characters who are not what they seem. Addie's life depends on waking Sonny up in his altered state of consciousness before it is too late.
