The Desert Horseman

 Falsely accused of robbing the army payroll, Steve hopes to clear his name with the help of Tom Jarvis, but finds Tom dead. He soon finds that Tom's brother was also killed and Mary Ann now runs the ranch. Tredway is trying to get Mary Ann to sell the ranch, but Steve wants her to keep it until he finds out why someone wants it and who robbed the payroll. Steve Gordon is falsely accused of robbing an army payroll and has been found guilty in a court-martial. Knowing his only chance to clear his name is to find the real robbers, he escapes from the guardhouse, with the help of his orderly, Smiley Burnette. He finds that the man he thinks can clear his name has been murdered, and the daughter, Mary Ann Jarvis, now runs his ranch, which is being sought by a gang for unknown reasons. He uses his alter-ego, a masked rider known as The Durango Kid, to find the culprits who stole the payroll and also are after the Jarvis ranch.
