S.P.I.C.

 The movie contains five narrated stories from my Life .The title S.P.I.C. is from the nickname me and my brothers received from the kids in the neighborhood in Chelsea Massachusetts. My brothers and me didn't know it was a racist slur, we were told it meant Special Person In Chelsea. I also call this set of stories the storyboard of my life. Storyboards are the blueprint of a story or movie, I chose to bring the unseen part of storytelling forward and create them as I am telling you the story. This movie has won The Student Academy Award and is eligible for Oscar nomination in January.
