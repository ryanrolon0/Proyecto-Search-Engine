Strangers When We Mate

 Featuring Dyke, Hardy Bull, Kenny Dooer and Heywood Hymen A very obscure 1970's California XXX flick about a large gathering of people (all strangers to each other) brought together by a hippie loon at a big ranch-chic house as an experiment in free lovemaking. All are given "a mild aphrodisiac" and swap off with each other in any combination that strikes their drug-addled fancy in the home's many groovy rooms.
