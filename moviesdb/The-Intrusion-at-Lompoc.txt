The Intrusion at Lompoc

 Lompoc, a quiet little inland town, moves peacefully along from week to week with little more excitement then the flutter of the leaves. The stage-coach rolls up to the one hotel each day and the usual quota of visitors arrive and depart with mechanical precision until one day a typical gambler, of pleasing manner, appeared and wrought consternation in the heart of a number of fair sex, aroused the jealousy of the local swains and the undying hatred of a former victim. There was a period of excitement entirely foreign to the little community of home lovers. When the excitement was over there were a few sadder folk in Lompoc, a few more ardent lovers, the town had rid itself of a great evil, which promised to undermine the welfare of the community, the atmosphere of Lompoc had been purified and the old rhythm was resumed.
