 Gerda will inherit a fortune in cash on her 21st birthday, but she has to take a safety-deposit box key to a bank to claim the cash. The key is supposed to be sewn into a dress among some old clothing that she inherited too. Pity she gave all the clothes to a dealer yesterday. She and her friends manage to track the dealer down in a ski resort, but the clothes have been sold to holidaymakers there. How can they be checked for the missing key? Ilja Richter assumes the role of a chambermaid for much of the rest of the film, and together the youngsters frantically seacrh for the key to the fortune.
