The H Files

 A merciless intruder grabs, binds and gags two beautiful government agents. They manage to escape and meet an undercover operative who tells them that she's discovered a plot to overthrow the government. Before the agents can report this information they are all captured, bound and muzzled - the better to serve as hero-bait for the sole remaining field agent who could ruin the foreign powers' nefarious plans.
