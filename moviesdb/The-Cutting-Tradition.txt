The Cutting Tradition

 The Cutting Tradition - Insight into female genital mutilation. This moving and sensitive documentary highlights, in a non judgmental way, the complex social, religious, cultural and economic issues which underpin the ongoing practice of female genital mutilation, or FGM. This film deliberately raises questions that are critical in understanding why FGM continues to be very common to this day in both rich and poor communities, despite being illegal in many countries of origin. It is estimated that up to 140 million women and girls have already undergone some form of female genital mutilation with a further three million added annually.
