Sympathie fuer den Tod

 Is the bizarre story of a very exceeding meeting with death. It is the surreal creation of author & director Oliver Kyr who throws the audience into a fascinating yet scary atmosphere between life and death. Renowned actors like Gerhard Polacek, German singer Annett Louisan and an extraordinary, abstract production design will open up new perspectives in regard to death.
