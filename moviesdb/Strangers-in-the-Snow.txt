Strangers in the Snow

 The effects of winter are prevalent in New York City. Central Park is drenched in snow, and the landscape appears to be surreal and pristine. A woman trudges through the snow, quietly sobbing. A man stands atop a hill, spots her and proceeds to pelt her with multiple snowballs. Out of this impulsive, playful aggression, the two strangers form a friendship. In a discursive conversation, they find a personal connection to one other, and their interaction culminates in an epic snowball showdown.
