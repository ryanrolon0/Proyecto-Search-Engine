The Story of Food

 The Story of Food is a playful, fast-paced animated short that will get you thinking about our broken food system. It reminds us of our lost connection with real and healthy food, and the work of small scale farmers around the world who appreciate the complex relationship between seeds, soil, people and the environment.
