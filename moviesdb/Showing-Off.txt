Showing Off

 Scrappy wants to impress his girl, who dismisses him with "oh, grow up." He sees a billboard, and decides smoking will impress her, so he fashions a cigar from cabbage leaves and proceeds to do a number of tricks. She's mildly interested, but then he swallows the cigar by accident and starts spitting fire; her panties catch on fire, and they panic trying to put them out.
