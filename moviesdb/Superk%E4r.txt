Superkär

 A genuine adventure about love from a six year old boy perspective, trying to understand how it works and how to win his girl. That she's a grown-up doesn't make it easier. We follow our curious charmer Adam when trying to get Zara to go on a date with him, through his dreams and fantasies, and on the new adventures they lead to. A film about love from the heart, made with lots of love by finicky young filmmakers.
