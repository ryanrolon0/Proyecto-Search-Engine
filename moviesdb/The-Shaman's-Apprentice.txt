The Shaman's Apprentice

 Elijah, a skeptical anthropologist who specializes in the study of shamanism, conducts field research with a powerful shaman healer, Santero. One day Elijah arrives at Fernando's hut and discovers the old man in disarray. Santero says he was injured by an evil sorceress, Akilina, and explains that without Elijah's help, he will succumb to her next attack. At first, Elijah is hesitant to believe Santero, but when Elijah accidentally attracts Akilina's attention, he finds himself cursed and on the brink of death. Will Elijah reevaluate his beliefs in order to save his life?
