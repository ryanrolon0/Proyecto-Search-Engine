The Sonosopher

 The Sonosopher is an experiential voyage into the peculiar life and art of Alex Caldiero. Tracing his birth and childhood in rural Sicily as well as his coming of age as a poet in New York City, Caldiero is found living in conservative Utah years after his conversion and separation from Mormonism. The film explores Caldiero's lifelong artistic investigation into Sonosophy,a unique hybrid of sound, poetry, and philosophy. Borrowing techniques from such diverse genres as avant-garde film and cinEma vEritE, The Sonosopher portrays Caldiero's life and work at its most traditional and most bizarre. Utilizing these diverse methods, the filmmakers artfully blend current performance and interview footage, 8mm family videos, and archival material to tell the intimate story of this largely unknown artist.
