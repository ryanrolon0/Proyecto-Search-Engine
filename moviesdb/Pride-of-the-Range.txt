Pride of the Range

 This is a completely bogus entry; no film bearing this title was either produced or distributed by Selig or any other company during this time period; Tom Mix, as well as the other players listed, never appeared in any film with this title at any point in their careers. The only possibility is that it's a re-release title for other film, identity unknown, filmed after 1910.
