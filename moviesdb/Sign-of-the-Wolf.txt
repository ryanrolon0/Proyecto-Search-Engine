Sign of the Wolf

 Because of a fight at a dog show between "Smoky" and "Shadow", Alsatian Shepherd dos, owned and trained by Judy Weston, "Smoky" loses first prize. Judy sells "Shadow", but Ben, the trainer, smuggles him into the plane taking them back to Canada. They crash in a snow storm and "Smoky", freed from his crate, escapes. Shadow, with a broken leg, manages to free himself and bring help to Judy and Ben, who are unconscious. Fox-camp owner Rod Freeman and his son Billy rescue them. Judy offers a reward for "Smoky." Mort Gunning and "Red" Fargo, fur hijackers, find "Smoky" and train him to steal pelts, and they tell Judy that "Smoky" has been killed by wolves. The fur-trappers now think that "Shadow" is doing the stealing and threaten to shoot him. When dog trainer Judy Weston crashes her plane in the Canadian wilds, one of her dogs (Shadow) rescues her and her servant but another canine (Smoky) escapes and is found by thieves who train him to raid fox farms. Judy, is cared for on the Freeman Fox Farm by father Rod and son Billy but Shadow is accused of being the fox raider.
