Realm

 Two parallel realms follow a young girl's life as her world is torn apart. In the natural realm she suffers from severe stomach pains and depression after witnessing her father's death. In the spiritual realm, her stomach is bleeding because it is chained to her father's dead body. While dragging his body by chains, she comes across two different doors. She must walk through one of the doors in order to continue her journey but whichever door she chooses affects not only her spiritual body but her physical body as well.
