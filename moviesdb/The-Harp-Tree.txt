The Harp Tree

 A beautiful family. A fine house. Educated, successful people. Some lived, most were murdered. From Dresden, Berlin and Paris and Prague, to Buchenwald, Auschwitz and Terezinstadt, two sons of survivors journey through Europe searching for traces of a lost family they never knew. Ron and Rick Steinhart's attempt to sort out these details of destruction are captured in "The Harp Tree," a film by Mark Birnbaum.
