So She Fell Silent

 Gisela, 72, is haunted by the memory of her family's execution in occupied Poland, which she witnessed first-hand. Six years old at the time, Gisela now has children and grandchildren of her own. Still, the agony of her past makes it difficult to connect with loved ones in the present. Forced to confront the deteriorating relationship with her grown daughter, Gisela makes a final effort to overcome her fears and open her heart to those she holds dear. A survivor's story, the film takes place in both present-day Manhattan and wartime Poland.
