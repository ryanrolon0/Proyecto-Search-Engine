The Artemis Effect

 The Artemis Effect and about girls attending Artemis Place during the 2008/09 academic year. Artemis Place is an academic and integrated life skills program in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada that serves girls who have been undeserved in the mainstream school system. Through a girl-led Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) project, eight Artemis girls, ages 16-19, created this video documentary to incite social change by speaking back to the oppressive labels and stereotypes girls like us encounter. We voice our individual and collective perspectives on negotiating mainstream and alternative school systems and highlight the importance of Artemis Place and its community philosophy in our processes of positive change.
