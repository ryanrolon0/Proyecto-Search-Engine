Swooner Crooner

 Hens are working in the "Flockheed Eggcraft Factory", laying eggs for the war effort until they get distracted by a rooster singing like qv##nm0000069##. Porky, the supervisor, rushes to investigate. Soon, he's auditioning for a new crooner; among those showing up are caricatures of 'Al Jolson' (qv), 'Jimmy Durante' (qv) and 'Cab Calloway' (qv). He evetually gets to a qv##nm0001078## clone, who introduces himself as "The Old Groaner". Between the two of them, egg production is soon more than he can handle.
