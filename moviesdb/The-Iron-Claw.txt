The Iron Claw

 Miserly old Anton Benson once recovered a treasure in gold from a sunken Spanish galleon, and in his greed murdered anyone who got in his way of keeping it. Now his family is gathered at his estate, Bensonhurst, and they are all searching for the treasure, which is hidden somewhere on the estate. Also looking for the gold is a masked killer called The Iron Claw, who murders one member of the family and lets the others know that they'll be next.
