Washing the Streets of Porto Rico

 "A very unique scene showing the method of washing down the streets in Porto Rico and of special interest now that this country forms part of Uncle Sam's domain. This is a particularly brilliant film, perfect in every detail and being something out of the ordinary has proved very successful."
