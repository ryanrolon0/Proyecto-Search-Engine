Skymaskinen

 This is a romantic fantasy about two old people, a man and a woman. We see them sitting by themselves isolated from one another. They both reminisce their common past and a love that only lived in the flesh. Their memories awaken the couple's slumbering spirits and they meet in a mental space of music and poetry. They unite in a large desolate factory, that awaits to release them from their earthly lives through the force of art instead of flesh.
