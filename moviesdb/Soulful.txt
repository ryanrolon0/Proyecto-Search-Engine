Soulful

 A woman addicted to crack and pregnant, sells the soul of her unborn child to the Devil so that it may be born healthy. The child is adopted by her sister and grows up in the church. By the time she is 12 she is singing church choir solos and is nicknamed, quite ironically, Soulful. But while this child is blessed with a beautiful voice, she is also cursed by her destiny to destroy love.
