Sirtlarindaki hayat

 With summer on its way, the mountain people leave their village with their herds. They pass through winding paths and valleys, and cross deep ravines, on their way to their summer quarters. Komati, situated at 2000 meters in altitude, is the first stop on this perilous journey, where the villagers set up camp. From there, they climb to 3500 meters to reach a second camp called Grand Kachar, at the peak of the majestic chain of mountains, where their herds are let to graze; covered in fog, these mountains rise above the Black Sea, separating it from the Anatolian plateau, as an insurmountable wall. Under the autumn rains, the mountain people then start their way back down, all in reverse... This film tells the story of women who carry on their shoulders the weight of a life of seasonal migration, in constant battle against a hostile natural environment.
