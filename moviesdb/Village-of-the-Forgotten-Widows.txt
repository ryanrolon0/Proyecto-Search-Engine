Village of the Forgotten Widows

 Think back to what you were doing in 1995. Were you fighting to survive? Wondering how many of your family members were still alive? The world ignored Srebrenica then and has forgot about it now. The documentary demonstrates the impact of the war and the effects it has on the survivors. In particular it will highlight the suffering of the widows and their families of the Srebrenica Massacre. Now 15 years on, these families are still displaced and there has seemingly been no justice served. We will follow several people, investigate their current living situations and shine a light on what needs to be done to allow these victims of Srebrenica a second chance at life.
