S.C.A.R.E. International

 Americans' Cold War anxieties were subsiding, despite the feverish escalation in Vietnam. President Nixon turned to a highly classified, radical splinter group of the CIA to agitate a complacent public. The shadowy syndicate, S.C.A.R.E. INTERNATIONAL (S.I.), had been founded for a single, simple reason born from fear--the leaders dreaded peace, believing it would make them obsolete. This is the story of General Streicher--last of the original founder, as he struggles to save S.I. His foot soldiers, descendants of botched military experiments, are veterans of America's frightful past. They're elusive, but their reputations are well know. And now, for the first time, their true motivations are revealed.
