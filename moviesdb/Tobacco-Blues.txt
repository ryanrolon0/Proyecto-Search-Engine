Tobacco Blues

 This documentary looks at four tobacco-farming families in Kentucky, to see how they are dealing with the current situation. Tobacco is a cash crop not easily replaced in the poor Appalachian region where most tobacco is grown. The farmers want the public to realize that they are not evil--the farmers are just trying to make a living the best way they know how. But while the tobacco companies continue to increase their overseas production, over 125,000 tobacco farmers are projected to lose a significant portion of their income during the next 5 years. This documentary looks at how the four families are coping with the possible loss of their farms, their livelihoods, and their lifestyle.
