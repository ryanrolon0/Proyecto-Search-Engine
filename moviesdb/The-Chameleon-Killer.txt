The Chameleon Killer

 Acid Falls is a peaceful town that hasn't had a murder in over a decade. But that all changes when a faceless killer begins offing the townsfolk one by one, and each murder is based on a different horror movie slasher. Now it's up to Sheriff Garris and his deputies to find and stop the killer before it's too late.
