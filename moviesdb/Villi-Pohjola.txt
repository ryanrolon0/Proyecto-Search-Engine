Villi Pohjola

 Western spoof set in the "Wild North", the Finnish Lapland. A young woman whose gold-digger father was killed two years earlier thinks the killer was Tundra-Tauno. She goes after him but soon realizes that she may be wrong and that Tauno may not be such a repulsive character after all.
