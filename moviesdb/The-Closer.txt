The Closer

 Steve is an average guy with less than average game. But when he calls on the services of The Closer, a hired gun that helps close deals for men, he not only gets the girl...he gets the promotion, too. Envious of Steve's upgraded status, Jimmy decides he'd like to incorporate The Closer's skills in his own less than average life. But when Jimmy finally calls on him to get him out of a tricky situation, things don't go exactly as planned.
