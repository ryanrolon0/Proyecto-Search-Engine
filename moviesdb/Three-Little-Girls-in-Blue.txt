Three Little Girls in Blue

 A reworking of "Moon Over Miami" set at the turn of the century. Three sisters set out for Atlantic City disguised as an heiress, her secretary, and a maid, in the hope that one of them will land a rich husband. Three farming sisters from Red Bank use their small inheritance to move husband by posing as a monied socialite while the other two pretend to be her secretary and maid. Men, money and love soon turn up but not necessarily in the right order or for the right sister.
