Smut Capital of America

 In the late 1960s, as the Sexual Revolution was first gaining steam, San Francisco was pushing the boundaries of what could be filmed and quickly became, according to the NY Times, 'The Smut Capital of the United States.' From shabby storefront theaters and live sex shows to the Erotic Film Festival, the City became ground zero in the fight over obscenity, as both local politicians and Federal law enforcement went to war with filmmakers and free-speech advocates. 'Smut Capital' talks to the theater owners, film producers and stars in an attempt to recreate a revolution that wasn't televised, but screened.
