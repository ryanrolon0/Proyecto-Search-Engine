Second Unit

 In this short comedy - made up entirely of old documentary stock footage - the second unit director of a low budget action film breaks up with his girlfriend while shooting benign establishing shots in Hollywood. Things get increasingly tense as the director comes to suspect his cameraman of having an affair with his ex. Features a brief cameo by the late Forrest J Ackerman.
