Sailors Landing Under Fire

 "This subject is without doubt one of the most interesting and exciting war pictures ever photographed for moving picture work. It shows a body of marines landing on the Cuban shore, the shallows prevent the boat from approaching closely, they wade ashore and are protected by the rifles of their comrades still remaining in the boat."
