Stinsen brinner... filmen alltså

 The stationmaster is trying to prevent his station from being closed. The train isn't coming and he has to explain to the waiting trainpassengers why it's late, while other people is trying to get the station for their use; for example the italians, who want to make a pizzeria out of it.
