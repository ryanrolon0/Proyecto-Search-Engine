Professeur Cupidon

 Bashful teacher Suchet is harassed by Lucette, a mischievous pupil, whose main amusement is to ridicule him on the one hand and to make him madly in love with her on the other hand. However, after a stay in Paris, Suchet comes back a changed man, elegant and self-assured. Now it's up to Lucette to fall under his spell.
