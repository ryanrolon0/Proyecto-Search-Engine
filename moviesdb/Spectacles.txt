Spectacles

 After losing his father, William Franklin, young, stubborn, and cursed with poor sight, seeks to invent his own remedy to seeing the world in a better light. When his invention fails him, Will meets a friend who helps him see the wonders of being young. 'Spectacles' is partly 2D and 3D. While a 2D only version is available, the story is meant to be told with 3D.
