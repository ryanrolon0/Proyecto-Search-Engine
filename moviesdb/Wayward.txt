Wayward

 A high strung woman's (SARA) life comes crashing down on a late night business trip. When she encounters a homeless man (LIONEL) with creative negotiating skills, Sara discovers their worlds are not as different as they first appear. Deftly blending tension, humor, and drama, Wayward examines how people can lose their humanity, but also find a way to rediscover it.
