Save Tibet... Why?

 Save Tibet...Why? Is the sequel to Visually And Respectfully Yours - also a The Tibetan Photo Project film. In this film project co-founders Mickey and Varga return to India for an update on the exiled Tibetan communities. Because of the 10 years of work by The Tibetan Project, Mickey and Varga are given unique access into the communities and lives of Tibetans. The world view of the Tibetans has largely been formed by visual images of Westerners with preconceived notions looking in on the Tibetan society. Surprisingly, the Tibetans had no culture based in photography. Through our documentaries we are giving the Tibetans a voice of their own.
