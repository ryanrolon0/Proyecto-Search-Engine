Salt Shakers

 Jay C. Flippen (as J.C. Flippen) is the master of ceremonies on an ocean liner introducing the various acts, including Mae McKim and Her Three Boys Friends, and McGurn's Twelve Tars from the stage show "I'd Rather Be Right." Joe Dorris also does an eccentric dance. Plot around the acts is the money that Flippen has collected from the passengers and entrusts to a dopey sailor (Joe Dorris) for safekeeping, who, of course, drops it through a porthole, thinking it is a safe.
