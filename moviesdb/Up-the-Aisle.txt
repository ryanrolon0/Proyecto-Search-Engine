Up the Aisle

 To inherit her beloved Nan's house shy, timid and socially awkward insect enthusiast Bexley must marry her unemployed Kiwi boyfriend Kevin in less than a week. If you've ever organized a wedding you'll know just how hard it is. But throw in a hired hit-man, a body that won't stay in it's coffin, flat tyres, anal probes, sumo wrestlers, an ill conceived Hangi pit, a burst water main, sabotaged beer kegs, samurai swords, two destroyed couches, a kidnapping, a shallow grave, a high speed car chase, a low speed car chase, a hostage situation, a shootout and a father who hates you're fiancE and you've got the recipe for a comedic disaster like you've never seen before. If she's ever going to get up the aisle Bexley will have to overcome all of these obstacles and choose the perfect napkins.
