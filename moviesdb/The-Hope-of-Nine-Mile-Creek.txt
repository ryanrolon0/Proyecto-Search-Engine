The Hope of Nine Mile Creek

 Nine Mile Creek in western Nebraska is a unique habitat that is dependent on a 100 year-old irrigation system. It became a haven for wild life and gained a reputation as one of the midwest's premier trout streams. Now, a century later the habitat is drying up and invasive plants have overtaken native vegetation. The film is the story of how a group of landowners and a handful of governmental agencies stepped in to save the endangered creek.
