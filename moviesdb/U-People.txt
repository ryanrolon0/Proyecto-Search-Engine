U People

 U People begins with the following disclaimer not make assumptions about anyone's sexuality". In a brownstone in Brooklyn a music video was made. But not just one camera was rolling, and not just music was caught on tape. 'Make a Move', the music video, made a splash on MTV's LOGO, was the first of its kind to depict women of color across sexualities and gender expression. One house, two days, thirty women and trans folks of color bridged their differences in the creation of this video. What the camera caught will introduces a hilarious, candid and very human voice into the discussion of gay and straight relations within the black community. This video made history by being the only music video ever to fully feature gay women of color in an intimate, witty look at their lives. The mission of the documentary is to dismantle the blanket categorization and ignorance inherent in the phrase "you people" by displaying unique individuals in possession of personal power and self-determination. It upholds the vision that camaraderie and sisterhood is vibrant and sustaining, though not always easy, among straight and gay women and gender non-conformists in the African diaspora.
