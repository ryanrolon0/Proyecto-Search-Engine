Texans Never Cry

 Texas Ranger Sergeant Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his pal, Pecos Bates (Pat Buttram), save from eviction the family of Nancy Carter (Gail Davis), whose father (Harry Tyler) has purchased fake Mexican lottery tickets. Gene suspects that Tracy Wyatt (Tom Keene as Richard Powers) heads the lottery counterfeit gang, but has no proof. The paper for the tickets is furnished by newspaper publisher Frank Bagley (Roy Gordon) who uses his daughter Rita (Mary Castle) as the courier. Fearing that Gene is getting too close in uncovering their racket, the gang sends for a hired gunman, Steve Diamond (Russell Hayden as Russ Hayden) to murder Gene. Badguy Tracy Wyatt plans to get rich through a phony Mexican lottery ticket scam. Texas lawman Gene wrecks the plot and must deal with the consequences.
