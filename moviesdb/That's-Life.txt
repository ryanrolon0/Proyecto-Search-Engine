That's Life

 The film is part of a projected series of 'self-portraits' where older people are asked what they wanted out of life when they were young, where they are now and how they come to terms with wherever they are. This film is about the NJ painter Paul Matthews and his artistic and private struggles toward success and clarity. His story is told without narration. It is funny, sad and ultimately very optimistic. Says one viewer is truly terrific! Really, really, I was fascinated, enthralled..'
