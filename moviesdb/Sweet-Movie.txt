Sweet Movie

 The intercut story of two women into withdrawal and madness, and another who captains a ship laden with candy and sugar, luring men and boys aboard for sex, death, and revolutionary talk. The beauty queen passes from a wealthy husband whose honeymoon delight is to urinate on her, to a muscular keeper who punches her, stows her in a suitcase, and ships her to Paris, to a lip-synching rock idol with whom she has a love spasm, to an Austrian commune complete with a banquet of vomit, urine, feces, chopped dildos, and wet nurses. By then she's in a fetal position, until everyone's rescued by reminders that "it's just a movie." In the contest of the "most virgin" Miss Monde 1984, Miss Canada wins, and prize is the marriage with the milk industry tycoon with his fifty billion dollars fortune. In their honeymoon, Miss Canada "does not accept" the golden penis of her husband, and with the support of the black man Jeremiah Muscle, she runaways to Paris. There she meets a Latin singer, El Macho, they have an intercourse in Eiffel Tour and they get stuck together. She moves to a weird anarchic community and later she becomes an actress working in a chocolate advertisement. Meanwhile, the revolutionary, pedophile, and mad killer Anna Planeta makes candy in her boat while sailing through the canals of a city that seems to be Amsterdam. She meets the sailor Potemkin and they have a torrid affair. Meanwhile she uses her candies to seduce young boys and kill her lovers. In the middle of the story, it is presented what seem to be footages of a Nazi doctor and a slaughter in a war with many dead bodies.
