The Vector File

 A geo-political thriller where Gerry Anderson finds that sometimes, everybody really is out to get you. Gerry's daughter, Mattie, accidentally prints out a DNA code that in the wrong hands can end the human race. The chase is on - the Russians, whose DNA code it is that Mattie has in her backpack, and a group of terrorists compete to get the code from the person they all assume has it, Gerry. With all this going on, Gerry's estranged wife Margaret is worried for her daughter's safety and finds herself another target in the race to find the code. Geologist Gerry Anderson left L.A. to be with his family in New Zealand, but is separated from his selfish wife who has custody of their daughter Mattie, yet dumps her on him without notice at her adulterous convenience. When Mattie is with daddy in the company's satellite observatory like that again, the wench messes up an important incoming file from Russia, where a dying scientist sent it before he was shot, to cover up her incompetent attempts to print out a silly drawing. Ruthless killers will stop at nothing to get the file, so they shoot the security guard but find nothing as Mattie hid the print-out except the page her 'horse' is on. Next they attack the Anderson home, but Gerry manages to cause one to have a fatal fall from the stairs and escapes with Mattie to a colleague's home. When they call the police all traces are already removed before they regain his home. Later the same police Detective Ramos sees Gerry arrive at work, the guard's murder scene, so he looks terribly suspicious, and the killers are still after him...
