Stained

 New York City. 1989. Pastor Phillip Wagner a man who has spent his entire life getting people to put their faith in God, loses his, after the death of his seven year old son. Shamed by his ability to practice what he preaches, he has withdrawn from everyone including his wife. At his darkest hour he becomes the witness of Christmas Miracle, that serves as the very sign that he's been looking for to know that his son is okay and in God's hands. A miracle that brings together an elderly couple that were ripped apart by the Nazi's over forty-seven years ago when it was discovered that they were hiding their Jewish friends. A beautiful and tragic story of hope, faith and love.
