The Fest

 American tourist, Doggg, and his Japanese friend, Tak, have been planning this Oktoberfest trip to Munich for years. But now that Doggg's wife is on the verge of leaving him if he doesn't maintain his sobriety, Doggg is faced with the challenge of a lifetime. As his friend, along with thousands of others around him, sing and dance to the joys of drunken revelry, Doggg struggles with the tugging temptation within.
