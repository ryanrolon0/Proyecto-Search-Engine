Victory

 A Palestinian youth basketball team playing in a tournament is taunted by another team who makes fun of Palestine. Each of the Palestinian players reflects on an incident in his or her life that makes them want to struggle for victory for Palestine. The youth remember experiences with checkpoints, military incursions, and the separation wall, but resolve to work together to win the game for Palestine.
