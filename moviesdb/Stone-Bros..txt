Stone Bros.

 City based Eddie sets off to reconnect with his blackfella roots by taking a sacred stone back to his hometown. But when wild-boy Charlie forces himself along for the ride, Eddie's spiritual journey goes off track and becomes a riotous trip through outback Australia as the boys are forced to contend with a self-obsessed Italian rock-god, a cross dressing cousin, and a demonic dog!
