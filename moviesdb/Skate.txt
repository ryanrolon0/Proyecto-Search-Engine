Skate

 A frozen stream runs past a town. Bo Young, a girl of about 14, wants to skate; her friend has to study, so she goes by herself. A young man watches her; she falls, he helps her up and asks her name. She tells him, but runs away from him at her first opportunity, returning to her friend's house. Upon reflection, how will she respond to what are probably the first stirrings of adult feelings?
