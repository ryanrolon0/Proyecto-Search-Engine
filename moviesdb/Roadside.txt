Roadside

 Ruth and Ray, two drifting strangers, hook up and head to the West Coast in search of a better life. A trip full of fun, lust and a whole lot of risk spins out of control as they end up stuck in a roadside town with a bag full of cash, a psyhco drug dealer hunting them down, and one big double-cross waiting to happen.
