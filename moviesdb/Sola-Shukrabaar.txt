Sola Shukrabaar

 Devi Maa Santoshi, the daughter of Bhagwan Shri Ganesh and Devi Maa Riddhi and Siddhi, confers her blessings on a couple only and after they undergo the rituals and prayers associated with appeasing Her for a period of 16 consecutive Fridays. It is during this period that the couple also undergo many trials and tribulations and may not survive to attain the desired blessings.
