The Bowery Waiter and the Old Time Ball Player

 "This is a very humorous picture brought about by reversing the action of the film. A customer in a Bowery cafe sits down at a table, and has various dishes of food thrown at him. He catches them in the air, and deposits them on the table without so much as spilling a drop."
