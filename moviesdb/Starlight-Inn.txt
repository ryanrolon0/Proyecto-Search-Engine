Starlight Inn

 STARLIGHT INN, is a true story about an Asian family experiencing the harrowing affects of addiction, wrapped in hiddenness and shame. As a film maker, I look for authentic stories that reveal truth and isn't afraid of exposing darkness. STARLIGHT INN, is one of those stories. It's a true story that journeys with a woman who confronts the harsh reality of addiction and it's effect on her family. Being an Asian, it's refreshing to see my culture on film, in ways it's never been seen before. Growing up in America, I know the dynamics of an immigrant family that has to face trying issues that usually are hidden in shame. This hiddenness is more ugly that the 'sin' itself, which inevitably strangles any family in guilt.
