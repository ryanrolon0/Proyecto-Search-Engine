Silo

 In May of 1969 a young man descended from a simple stone hut high on a windswept ledge in the mountains. He came with a message. Argentina was in the midst of a "dirty war" of disappearance and torture. In that distant corner of the Earth an unholy alliance of church and military dictatorship tried to silence this young man. They failed. He spoke to a few hundred souls who had braved the cold of these forbidding heights and the armed soldiers intent on keeping order. His enemies mockingly denounced him as a guru, or a false messiah. He called himself a thinker or a writer. And he wrote everything form philosophical essays to novels. And today high in the Andes you'll hear his message.
