Rainbow Valley

 Rainbow Valley needs a new road and newcomer John Martin agrees to build it. Rogers is out to stop it and alters the town's petition to the Governor thereby obtaining the release of his boss Butch Galt. John and Butch were cell mates in prison. So Butch gets John to agree to wreck the road and furnishes him with dynamite. But dynamite is just what John needs to finish the work and he hopes to take care of Butch's gang at the same time. Undercover government agent John Martin is assigned to protect men building a road through gold country. The town's leading citizen, in league with bandits, brings in a hired gun, Galt - who recognizes John from a previous encounter.
