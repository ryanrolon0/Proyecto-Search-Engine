The Black Stallion

 While traveling with his father, young Alec becomes fascinated by a mysterious Arabian stallion that is brought on board and stabled in the ship he is sailing on. When the ship tragically sinks both he and the horse survive only to be stranded on a deserted island. Alec befriends the horse, so when finally rescued both return to his home where they soon meet Henry Dailey, a once successful trainer. Together they begin training The Black to race against the fastest horses in the world. In 1946, shortly after the end of World War II, 10-year-old Alec Ramsey & his father are traveling on a ship off the north coast of Africa, on their way back to England. While on deck, Alec sees a handsome black Arabian being pushed into its quarters by some brutal men. Later Alec visits the horse with sugar cubes, which the animal takes. That night, their ship is struck by lightning & catches fire in a violent storm, and Alec manages to set the horse free but is knocked off the ship himself. The ship goes down with everyone on board, leaving only Alec & the horse as survivors. Marooned on a remote island, Alec & the horse forge a strong bond, and after being rescued they return to the U.S.A. where Alec meets a horse trainer named Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney). Henry teaches Alec how to ride, and soon Alec & the beautiful horse - who he names 'The Black' - will challenge 2 of the country's fastest racehorses in a challenge match...
