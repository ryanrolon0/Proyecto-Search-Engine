So... Happy Together

 Talkative Lianne and colorful gay Osmond become fast friends when they meet at the first Gay Pride Parade in Malate in the early 80's. For the next thirty-plus years of their lives, they'll do everything together, whether it's eating, shopping, discussing life and even looking for the perfect man! So inseparable are their pair that even their mothers become best friends too.
