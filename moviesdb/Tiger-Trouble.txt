Tiger Trouble

 Big game hunter Goofy is riding his trusty elephant in search of a tiger. Unfortunately, while they are stopped for lunch, the tiger finds them, and soon enough, Goofy is separated from his rifle. The tiger toys with the goof for a while, then peels off the sole of one shoe and heads for the foot. Meanwhile, Goofy's been preparing a hotfoot for his tormentor, which gets him a small head start on the chase that follows. After a fair bit of chasing, Goofy's elephant comes to the rescue.
