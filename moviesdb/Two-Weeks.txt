Two Weeks

 Two weeks off perhaps? Break free with Johnny Abegg, from a monotonous world of ideals and unhappiness, to experience the harsh and remote wilderness of Tasmania on his own, to find out who he really is. The decision takes Johnny on an inward journey, to a place of reflection, accountability and deep self inquiry; facing a hidden 'dark side' alone, within the unforgiving landscape. Through the internal battle of opposites, amplified by the humbling surrounds; Abegg is stripped back to the basic creature that he is, to find a moment of clarity amidst the endless questions... So is there an answer? A right way to live? Find out for yourself. Just surrender.
