The Story of a Dress

 This short, released as part of the publicity campaign for _The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964)_ (qv), tells the story of the red dress worn by 'Debbie Reynolds (I)' (qv) in the film's dance number finale. It begins with costume designer 'Morton Haack' (qv), director 'Charles Walters (I)' (qv), and producer 'Lawrence Weingarten' (qv) going over preliminary designs. We next see studio seamstresses cutting patterns and making the dress, which includes the hand sewing of sequins. In the final scene, Reynolds and costar 'Harve Presnell' (qv) perform a test-dance to make sure that the costume will look its best when the scene is filmed.
