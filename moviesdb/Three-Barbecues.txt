Three Barbecues

 Three Barbecues is a blackened comedy about three barbecues in one day. The movie follows the same eclectic, time warped, characters during this afternoon into evening stretch of side dishes and light beer. The hosts provide entertainment for any appetite. Vera and Willie Wong are an Asian duo that serves hot dogs of all kinds and celebrates Americana with a splash of Red, Light and Brew! During this barbecue, there will be a musical "Parade of Side Dishes" that has all the ladies doing a choreographed departure from the kitchen to the backyard. Stan Smiley and Miss Dinah, an African-American couple, amuse guests with Stan's "beer-in, bone-in" marinading method. Guests enjoy Stan's ragtime song and dance as he prepares the delightful dish. Get on your smoking jackets fellas! Beef and Candy Barklage host the final auspicious gala. During their soiree, Beef competes for Griller of the Year while the international Griller's World Correspondence Crew broadcasts live from the his backyard. Also visiting the patio will be Gladwell; Beef's nemesis, The Deviled Egg Nut; the gossiping April and Koko; their husbands Hank and Virgil; and B.J., the only out-of-the-closet gay man in town.
