The Faces Behind the Dolls

 A tribute to the Dominican and Latin American workers at the Madame Alexander Doll Company and their dedication creating the beautiful dolls that have delighted children and adults around the world. These dolls have been collected by queens, business women, actresses, and world leaders. The workers-artists, seamstresses, stylists-assemble, disassemble, and dress the dolls, contributing to the culture, fame, and elegance of this industry. In 1923, Beatrice Alexander Behrman, a Brooklynite of Russian heritage, opened a doll factory in Manhattan. The factory still bears her name, The Madame Alexander Doll Company, Inc., and reflects the love for dolls she shared with her father, a Russian immigrant who founded the first doll hospital in New York.
