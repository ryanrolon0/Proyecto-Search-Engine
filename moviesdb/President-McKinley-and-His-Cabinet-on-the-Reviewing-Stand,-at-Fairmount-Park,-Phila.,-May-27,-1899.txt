President McKinley and His Cabinet on the Reviewing Stand, at Fairmount Park, Phila., May 27, 1899

 The Chief Magistrate of the Nation is here shown reviewing the soldiers, and also the boys from the Cruiser Raleigh, who returned from Manila. The film is a beautiful lively subject, full of detail and one that will interest every one who admires the great War President.
