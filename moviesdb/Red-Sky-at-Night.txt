Red Sky at Night

 Romantic comedies may be common but this may be the only one filmed in canoes on New York City's East River. A man and a woman are paired together in a canoe for a singles outing on the East River and get swept out to sea. There, with no visible sign of any other human life, they must come to terms with each other and the future. Questions arise vegetable? Are breath-mints a fruit? Does the Bible mention Staten Island, specifically?
