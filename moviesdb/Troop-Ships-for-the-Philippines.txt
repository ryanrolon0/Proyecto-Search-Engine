Troop Ships for the Philippines

 The "SS Australia" and "SS City of Sydney" leave San Francisco on May 25, 1898 carrying US Army volunteers for the Spanish American War. In the opening scenes, happy troops on the "SS Australia" wave as the camera passes. Then the "SS City of Sydney" passes through the Golden Gate with Fort Point in the background, but no Golden Gate Bridge.
