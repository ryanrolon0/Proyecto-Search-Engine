The Organ Grinder

 An organ grinder and his monkey make their way down a New York streetscape. The monkey climbs up several stories to get tips from a couple of women. It does a little dance for a group of kids, then uses some props to impersonate 'Harpo Marx' (qv), 'Stan Laurel' (qv), and 'Oliver Hardy' (qv). It then sits down at a couple of pianos and begins playing, first, the title song, then 42nd Street. It gets caught in a runaway car, and after running into a fruit cart, crashes into a music store and comes out as a one-man band with the organ grinder in the rear.
