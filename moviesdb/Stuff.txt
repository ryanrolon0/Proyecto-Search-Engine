Stuff

 The personal odyssey of a Portland, Oregon filmmaker dealing with his father's death and the garage-sized storage unit full of the stuff he left behind. The film also follows the film maker's long-time friend who drives to Iowa to bury his father's ashes. Part road movie, part meditation, 'Stuff' is an intimate and unflinching examination of the father/son relationship.
