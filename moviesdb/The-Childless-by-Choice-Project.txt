The Childless by Choice Project

 No kids, thank you. At a time when one in five U.S. women remains childless at age forty, The Childless By Choice project takes a humorous yet probing look at the motives and decision making around voluntary childlessness. What happens when the question 'When should we have kids?' morphs into 'Should we have kids?' Are these couples childless or child-free? You decide.
