The Haunted Village

 Morag the Tulga Witch seeks revenge on her old enemy Logray, shaman of the Ewoks, who holds the magic Sunstar while she possesses it's darker half, the Shadowstone. The Witch unleashes her flying Mantigrue to destroy the Ewok's sun berry trees, turns the fire folk into forest fire spreading pyromaniacs, frames the Ewoks for the kidnapping of a baby Phlog, and kidnaps Logray's young apprentice Teebo and his friends. All this to lure her sworn enemy back to Mount Thunderstone to decide who will posses the two halves of the Sunstarshadowstone.
