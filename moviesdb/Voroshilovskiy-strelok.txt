Voroshilovskiy strelok

 A very typical post-Soviet era storyline. A bunch of vagabonds lured an innocent teenage girl to their apartment, offered her a drink, intimidated then gang raped her. Local cops are incapable to undertake an adequate action against the scoundrels - prevented by the superior chief of the local police (militia) which is the dad of one the scumbags. The case is closed. The girl's grand-dad tired of endless circumlocution decides to take revenge of his own.
