Universidade em Crise

 In 1975 Brazil, some serious political conflicts were taking place in Brazilian society, naturally affecting the Universities. Military dictatorship suffered its first blow with the death of journalist Wladimir Herzog while he was imprisoned in DOI (an Information department, one of the landmarks of torture in Brazil). The death of such a well-known journalist resulted in protests all over the country, including the universities. At USP (São Paulo University), students on strike joined forces with other segments of society, demanding freedom, democracy and the right to organize. Also, the documentary comments on the the invasion of CRUSP (University of São Paulo's student lodgings) by repression forces.
