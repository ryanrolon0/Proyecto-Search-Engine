Rolling

 A comeback of Aggressive Roller Blading, now called Freestyle Rolling turns into a lifestyle and a family affair. Three young men, from the Bronx, become a part of a Freestyle Rolling team. The team sets their lives straight and changes their old ways of the streets. The team becomes a close knit surrogate family who respect and inspire each other into becoming good and successful people.
