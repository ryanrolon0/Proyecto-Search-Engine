Pumpkin

 Set one year after a cataclysmic event known as "The Uprising" forced humanity out of the major cities and into cramped, fortified refugee camps, "PUMPKIN" tells the story of a viral holocaust that has shifted the balance of global power into the hands of the walking dead and forces two survivors to the breaking point, one fighting to protect what remains of his family and home, the other trying to get out of the quarantine zone to safety.
