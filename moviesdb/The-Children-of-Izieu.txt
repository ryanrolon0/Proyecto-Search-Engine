The Children of Izieu

 In 1944, one month before the end of World War II, the Gestapo in Lyon, under the command of Klaus Barbie, sent two vans to the French village of Izieu to remove the Jewish children from an orphanage known as La Maison d'Izieu. In a cold and senseless raid, 44 children and 5 adult caretakers were thrown into vans like pieces of cordwood and sent to Auschwitz, where they were immediately gassed. This documentary takes the viewer on an emotionally wrenching journey through one of the most tragic untold stories of the Holocaust.
