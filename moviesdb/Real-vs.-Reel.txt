Real vs. Reel

 A woman talks about her sobriety and what led her to stop drinking nearly three years before; then, she asks a question of a friend, sitting next to her on a sofa. Who's watching them, and who's watching the watchers? Stories within stories in a world of reality TV. Will we ever peel away all the layers and find something real?
