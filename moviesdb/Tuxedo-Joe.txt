Tuxedo Joe

 Joey Tucci, a bombastic comic and aspiring actor, has the world at his feet. With a one-man show and the promise of a major network sitcom on the horizon, success has struck at an early age for the 33 year-old entertainer. But repeat episodes of unpredictable, tempestuous behavior send Joe into weekly therapy at the behest of his long-suffering sister and agent, Peg. The therapy sessions unravel years of unsettled, emotional trauma and results in a surprising diagnosis with an illness that is spoken in misunderstood whispers at best, Joe struggles to find peace and acceptance while overcoming incredible odds.
