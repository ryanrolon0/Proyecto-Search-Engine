The Gallstone

 Toby Ballbag is at that awkward stage in every young adult's life where he is struggling to find a better job, a girlfriend, and most importantly, himself. With the help of a quirky old wizard, Mage Gonadrius, and a magical relic known as the Gallstone, Toby's quest for self-discovery becomes a journey of epic proportions. In his travels he will encounter a hapless assassin (Tim O'Donnell), an enchanted steed named Bikey, countless quarrels, and even the girl of his dreams. Toby will soon learn that the trick to finding the diamond in the rough isn't always digging deep.
