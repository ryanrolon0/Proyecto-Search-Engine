The Skids Live

 In March 2010 Punk Legends The Skids reformed for the last time to play the famous Alhambra Theatre in Scotland. The gig was the culmination of a months retrospective celebrating the music, films and words of Skids front-man Richard Jobson. A sold out gig was caught on film by the team Jobson uses to shoot his movies. The result is a high energy performance that captures everything that was great about one of the best loved bands to come out of the Punk/New wave era. The film is inter-cut with an interview with Jobson on stage by crime novelist Ian Rankin.
