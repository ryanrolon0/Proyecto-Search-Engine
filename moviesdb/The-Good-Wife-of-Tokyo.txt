The Good Wife of Tokyo

 This documentary uses a variety of interviews, conversations in rooms of Tokyo women talking about relationships, an offbeat women's religious group, and a girl band with provocative lyrics and body language to show a view of Japanese women quite contrary to the traditional representation of the subservient wives and geishas of media.
