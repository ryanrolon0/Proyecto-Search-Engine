Tabitha's Aquarium

 Tabitha, a self-proclaimed fish enthusiast, is convinced that her 'touch' is lethal after pet fish and unexpectedly dies following contact. Consequently she dons a pair of latex gloves and finds work in a taxidermy studio where the risk of killing anything else is minimal. Yet just as Tabitha begins to relax and discover the joy in restoring dead fish, tragedy strikes again and ultimately forces her to choose between her isolating phobia and a budding relationship with Wade, the quirky owner of Living Dead Taxidermy.
