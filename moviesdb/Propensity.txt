Propensity

 Thomas, Kyle and Marint had it all the rise. But when tragedy strikes and their worlds crumble, it proves to be more than they can bare, and they find themselves caught in a forsaken ghost land somewhere between heaven and hell. In this anguished world, nothing is what it seems, and these nomads must face their demons head on in order to recover a once fallen destiny.
