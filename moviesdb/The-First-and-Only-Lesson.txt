The First and Only Lesson

 A single mother returns home on Halloween after picking up her 10 year old daughter from school. She discovers that her daughter was in a fight with another student. A confrontation ensues between the mother and daughter. The mother discovers that her daughter is very upset because her lifelong obsession about flying has been discovered by her classmates, who are making fun of her for it. The mother promises to teach her daughter to fly that very night. During the whole night, she begins a long training session that at times looks like a fantasy or a game, and at times looks more like a catharsis. By the end of the night, the only thing left to do is fly.
