The Hunting Season

 High in the French Pyrenees, three generations of wild boar hunters stalk their prey. With their much-loved dogs they navigate dense woodland in pursuit of 'The Black Beast'. The passions and struggles of these hunters form the basis of The Hunting Season. The feature debut of filmmaker Patrick Fenn.
