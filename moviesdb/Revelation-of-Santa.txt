Revelation of Santa

 A quirky, coming-of-age Christmas story about a young boy who discovers the truth about Santa... It is Christmas Eve and single mother Elena is rushed and slightly panicked at the thought of pulling off Christmas alone and keeping her son's belief of Santa alive. Her only son Anthony will journey from innocence to understanding as he discovers the truth about Christmas. This coming of age Christmas story is mixed with people describing their own Revelations of Santa.
