Randal & Simon's Big Damn Movie

 Randal & Simon, as well as a few of their friends along the way, have the wildest Fourth of July of their lives as they travel all around Staten Island in search of a hot girl driving a blue Mustang, the most epic party of the summer, the world's greatest slice of pie, and the answers of what to do next in life. This modern look at post-high school summer is to Staten Island, New York 2010 as American Graffiti was to Modesto, California 1962. Randal & Simon's Big Damn Movie is a light hearted tale with a strong moral that is all-ages friendly and a bucket of laughs along the way.
