The Hanging Tree

 Character study of a Doctor who saves a local criminal from a mob who are trying to hang him, but then tries to control the life of the young man, realising that he can exploit his secret. This laid-back Western stars genre stalwart Gary Cooper as a doctor in a gold-mining camp, who devotes his time to treating blind girl Maria Schell. Unfortunately, however, the doctor has a rather sinister past which may place his patient in considerable danger.
