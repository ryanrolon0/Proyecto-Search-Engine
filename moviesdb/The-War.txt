The War

 This poignant documentary tells the story of the Latino veterans of the South Bay and Central Coast of California. These brave young men, many of whom were farm workers, enlisted or were drafted into the US Armed Forces. Many felt the need to prove that they were patriotic and deserved the civil rights and liberties of all Americans. Their experiences overseas changed them and when they came home, they became involved in both social justice and community issues. Included, is the story of Navy veteran Cesar Chavez, who returned from the war and helped found the United Farm Workers union.
