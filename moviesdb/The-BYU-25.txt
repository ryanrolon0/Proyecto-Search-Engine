The BYU 25

 In Spring of 2007, the administration at Brigham Young University invited Vice-President Dick Cheney to speak at their commencement ceremony. Even at what is rated as one of the most conservative campuses in the country, students became outraged, holding peaceful protests and circulating petitions denouncing Cheney. Some students went so far as to plan an alternative commencement and booked consumer advocate Ralph Nader as the keynote speaker.
