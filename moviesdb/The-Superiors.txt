The Superiors

 Mclean and Studs are two middle men for an unseen crime syndicate. They do the unfavorable jobs, the un-glorified clean up work. All they want is to just once get to beat somebody up, kill somebody or, at least, threaten something, anything. Most of all, they just want some respect. Marty and Jupiter are downtrodden; as is the case when enthusiastic young men attempt to become criminals. However, they have no idea about how to become criminals. But when Marty steals his sister's handgun, it puts them on a path leading straight to Mclean and Studs, who have been given $5,000 to purchase a new handgun. Mclean and Studs desperately want respect. Marty and Jupiter desperately want to be criminals. They only thing standing in their way is each other. Four 'criminals' without a clue about how to be criminals. 'The Superiors'
