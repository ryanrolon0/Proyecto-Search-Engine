Song of the Soul

 Song of the Soul follows South African nurses, social workers, and caregivers providing hospice and palliative care in both urban and rural settings to those with life-threatening illnesses and their families. In the midst of a health tsunami and scarce resources, they have developed an effective model of community-based care. We hear heartbreaking words from a grandmother raising her grandchildren after her own children died. We see the joy and pride of people who are now living active lives with HIV. We feel the frustration over the lack of nutrition and prevalent poverty. We witness the resourcefulness and generosity of South Africans opening their hearts to the plight of their neighbors. We see the power of love in the gentle touch of a caregiver. We see hope.
