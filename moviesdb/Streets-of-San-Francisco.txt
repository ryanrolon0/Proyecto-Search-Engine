Streets of San Francisco

 A gangster's son sees his father rob and murder a man. The detective investigating the case, deciding that the boy will never tell what he knows if he's locked up in juvenile detention, takes the boy home with him to spend some time with a "real" family, and the boy begins to form an attachment to the detective's father, a retired cop.
