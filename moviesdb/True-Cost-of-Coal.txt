True Cost of Coal

 Coal mining is a way of life and death in Eastern Kentucky. Despite over 100 years of mining, the communities that provide this work force remain some of the most poverty-stricken and contaminated areas in the United States. As energy prices soar and the government and coal companies unite to increase coal extraction, mountain communities rally to protect their rights. This film examines these issues through personal stories of people living in mountain communities.
