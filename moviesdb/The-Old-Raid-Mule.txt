The Old Raid Mule

 Andy arrives in town with a loaded shotgun and vowing to shoot a neighbor because, as he tells the loafers at the country store, he has been skinned in a deal. He calls out the neighbor and ends up trading the mule he is riding for an old jalopy of a car. After he gets home the car won't run anymore and Andy sets out with a shotgun filled with buckshot held in place by a cork in the barrel. The neighbor talks him out of his intended purpose again, and Andy ends up trading his shotgun for a clock, which quickly proves defective. He sets out again, but this time the neighbor is the one with a shotgun. This may, or may not, be a good thing for Andy.
