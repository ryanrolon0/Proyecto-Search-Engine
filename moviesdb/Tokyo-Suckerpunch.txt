Tokyo Suckerpunch

 Billy Chaka - popular graphic novelist, Cleveland native and rabid Japanophile - travels to Japan for the first time to attend the premiere of a cheesy movie made from his self-mythologizing work (in the feature Chaka is a journalist for teen magazine Youth in Asia). There, he must contend with not only jarring culture shock but also mysterious fans and a dangerous, mob-related kidnapping that starts to resemble one of his own crazy plots. All, of course, while love-hate sparring with his cute and resourceful editor, Sarah. Young writer Billy Chaka authors a column that portrays him as a hero living fictionalized version of modern-day Tokyo. His column is turned into a movie, but at the Tokyo premiere, Chaka clashes with the director, who turns up dead.
