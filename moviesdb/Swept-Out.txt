Swept Out

 Chronicles the lives of several Columbus, Ohio impoverished citizens who struggle to survive in tent and shanty communities along a river that snakes through the heart of the city. Filmed over four seasons in '06 and '08, 'Swept Out' dramatizes the precarious nature of the outsiders' relationship to one another, youth gangs and immage conscious Columbus officials.
