Tropical Heat

 An insurance investigator (Rick Rossovich) is hired by the American wife (Maryam d'Abo) of a maharaja to go to India to investigate the questionable death of her husband. Immediately the two start an affair that leads to several soft-core sex scenes scattered throughout the film. Meanwhile an Indian woman (Asha Siewkumar) believes that her own father's disappearance may be involved in the murder, a story that local police dismiss. She then stalks the wife to get proof of a conspiracy.
