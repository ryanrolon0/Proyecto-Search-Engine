Turn Me On

 Turn Me On explores the history of the vibrator. Through a group of sexpert characters, the documentary uncovers the socially camouflaged sex toy - hidden in the underwear drawer since it was invented over 120 years ago. Turn Me On reveals a social and sexual history that some people would prefer remained a secret.
