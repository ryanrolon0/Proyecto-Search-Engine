Something in the Night

 From 1976 to 2004, a man existed known only to a few as Peter Hicks "AKA" Peter Parts. This man was an otherwise outstanding citizen and Good Samaritan until one fateful night. In March of 1976 something dark and sinister arose within Hicks.For the next 10 years he would engage in a game of evading local and state law enforcement until finally being caught in 1986. After serving five years on Death Row he managed a harrowing escape and continued his bloody gratification while traveling from state to state. Peter Parts, as he quickly came to be known, gained a reputation as one of the deadliest men to walk the earth until suddenly disappearing in 2004.
