Voices for Justice

 A short documentary about the 'West Memphis 3', Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelly, and Jason Baldwin, who were wrongfully convicted of the murders of three children in Arkansas in 1993. The short has new interviews and statements from the prisoners, a discussion of the new evidence, an interview with 'Devil's Knot' author Mara Leveritt, and the importance of the upcoming Arkansas Supreme Court hearing. It also follows the grass roots campaign of the Arkansas Take Action group, and several celebrity supporters, Eddie Vedder, Johnny Depp, and Natalie Maines, who gave speeches and performed together recently in Little Rock for a rally for the WM3, where this short film was also screened for a sold-out crowd at the Robinson Auditorium.
