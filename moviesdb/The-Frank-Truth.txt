The Frank Truth

 The Frank Truth is an eye-opening immersion into muckraking journalism, tabloid reporting and biting satire. Shot over the course of two years in Ottawa, The Frank Truth, provides unprecedented access to this concealed world. Wonder how FRANK Magazine digs up dirt on journalists, celebrities, business leaders and politicians? It is revealed here for the first time. The story veers wildly from comical to serious and back again. The Frank Truth takes an unblinking look at the questionable journalistic ethics involved in publishing North America's only satirical magazine, but it also explores the need for an independent, alternative view that exposes the mis-conduct of business leaders, journalists, celebrities, and politicians. A media, cultural and political watchdog all rolled into with a touch of comedy thrown-in for good measure.
