Taxidermy

 A day at Luther W Kuhlman & Son's taxidermy shop on Long Island, in 1996. UPS delivers forms. Ron Kuhlman prepares a stag, killed that year in the Catskills; his assistants, Bill Arsell and Jeffery Kuhlman, are working on a woodcock and a bearskin rug. The work involves saws, needle and thread, tacks, hot glue gun, stapler, and clay. Arsell talks briefly about when and why he came to work there. When the stag is finished, Ron signs, numbers, and dates the underside. The film begins with a quick shot of live animals together and ends with shots of a display of stuffed beasts at a museum.
