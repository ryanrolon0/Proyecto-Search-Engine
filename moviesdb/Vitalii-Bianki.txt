 This film is about the life of animals and plants in the forest. Animals and plants have just as many events in their lives as people. Every day and every minute the population of the forest is building homes, making families and raising their babies, just like people do. How do we learn about this? How can we understand the voices of birds and animals? How can we read their footprints? What does the fish do in the wintertime? How does the chicken breathe in the egg? All of this, and more, we can learn from the "Forest news" by Vitali Bianki.
