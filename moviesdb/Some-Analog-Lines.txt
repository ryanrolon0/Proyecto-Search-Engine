Some Analog Lines

 Some Analog Lines is a playfully philosophical, surprisingly personal essay film that examines the dichotomy between digital technology and the artistic process of filmmaking. It is about animation, computers, clay, celluloid; a paper mask; a wooden shelf. More importantly, it is about what we respond to when we watch a film, and why.
