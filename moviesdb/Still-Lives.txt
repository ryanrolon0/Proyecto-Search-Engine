Still Lives

 Filmmaker / photographer Michael Rababy creates a pure cinematic experience with 'still lives' - a 10 minute short film with no dialog. 'Still Lives' is the story of a man and a woman falling in - and out - of love, told through black and white still photographs and set to the music of Ravel and Satie.
