Scumrun II

 More madcap antics from the Scumrun rally, this year presented by the luscious Emily Booth. The Scumrun route is a closely guarded secret until the morning of each new day. Many of the teams traveling in fancy dress and anything goes! Join the A-team, the Holy Rollers, Team Stag and even Marty & Doc Brown as they traverse their way across Europe in vehicles bought for less than 500 pounds. This year has an exciting twist as the cars and drivers take to the Nurburgring, Germany. No flash cars, hotels or champagne - just beer, campsites and scrap motors all in the name of charity.
