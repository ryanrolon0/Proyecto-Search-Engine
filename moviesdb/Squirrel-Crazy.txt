Squirrel Crazy

 Winter arrives and Nutsy Squirrel does not have an adequate nut supply, but he discovers a well-stacked table of nuts guarded only by a small dog. It doesn't take Nutsy long to make off with the nuts. The maid returns and finds the nuts gone, and locks the little dog out in the cold. Nutsy takes pity and invites him in to share his warm home and nuts.
