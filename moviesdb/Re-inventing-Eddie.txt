Re-inventing Eddie

 Eddie is a "normal" dad, who loves life, his job and most of all family. He and his wife Jeanie are totally open when answering their children's questions, no matter how embrassing. This backfires when Katie innocently reagles her school with her inside knowledge of carnal pleasures. The headmistress is concernede at the level of Katie's knowledge and at her picture of Eddie dressed up as a 'rough old granny' as part of a bath-time game. Eddie is investigated and forced to exile himself from his family until the matter is dealt with.
