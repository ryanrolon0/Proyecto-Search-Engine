Reproduction of the Corbett-McGovern Fight

 The last fight between these little giants was fought at San Francisco, March 31, 1903. Interest was centered in this fight because of the reputation of McGovern, who was popularly known as "Terrible Teddy," and who was only defeated by Corbett once before. They met again in order to settle beyond a doubt which was the master. Corbett proved again that he was the champion. The pictures are true to life, and figures being large, the fighters are easily discerned, and they fight from the time the gong sounds until the finish, when McGovern is counted out. We have endeavored to make these fight films as accurate as possible and have even introduced into the pictures the dispute which arose between the fighters and their seconds prior to the fight. We will sell six of the principal rounds, containing about seven hundred feet if desired, and in the set of six we include the first and last, or knockout rounds, the four others being the most interesting.
