The Drop

 Two individuals from different worlds struggle to safeguard their identities and articulate their beliefs. Both face personal failure and, more significantly, suppression from the political and economic system in which they live. The Painter, a naive newcomer, examines and embraces everything he encounters including the distant and purposeful Activist, a figure he, by chance, runs into on his arrival. Despite their difference and the lack of security in their lives, they become unified by a shared determination, but it's not a place where that kind of love can flourish. The Painter becomes a surprise discovery for the authorities and we see what could have been. A snap shot of the 21st Century, THE DROP is a meditation on art, activism and immigration.
