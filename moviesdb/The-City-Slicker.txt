The City Slicker

 Scrappy, the city slicker, goes to visit his country cousin. Scrappy is a practical joker and carries an electrical buzzer in his hand, and water-squirting bouquets in his button hole. But his country cousin is not as dumb as Scrappy thinks, and some of Scrappy's jokes backfire on him.
