Pyar Ka Rog

 Fellow collegians, Ravi Singh and Reema Sharma, fall in love; she is introduced to Ravi's eccentric dad, Colonel Udham, who approves of her, and permits them to get married. Shortly thereafter Udham has an indoor accident, hurts his leg, and recruits an attractive nurse to look after him. Both end up falling in love with each other, and want to get married. Ravi and Reema are thrilled when they find out, but their joy will be short-lived after Reema finds out that the nurse is none other than her very own mother.
