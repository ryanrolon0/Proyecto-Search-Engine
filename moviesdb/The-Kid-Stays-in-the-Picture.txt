The Kid Stays in the Picture

 This documentary captures the life story of legendary Hollywood producer and studio chief Robert Evans. The first actor to ever to run a film studio, Robert Evans' film career started in 1956, poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel. His good looks, charm and overwhelming confidence captured the eye of screen legend Norma Shearer, who offered him a film role. After a glamorous--but short-lived--career as a movie star, Evans tried out producing. At the age of 34, with no producing credits to his name, he landed a job as chief of production at Paramount Pictures. Evans ran the studio from 1966-1974. During his tenure, he was responsible for such revolutionary films as The Godfather, Rosemary's Baby, Love Story, The Odd Couple, Harold and Maude and Chinatown. By the early '80s, the Golden Boy of Hollywood was losing his luster. After a failed marriage to Ali MacGraw, a cocaine bust and rumored involvement with the Cotton Club murder, he disappeared into near-obscurity. Only through tremendous will and uncanny luck did he once again rise as the kid who stays in the picture. Movie mogul 'Robert Evans (I)' (qv) self narrates the story of his movie life. Once an aspiring actor, he was a successful business owner of a woman's wear company when, independently, Hollywood royals actress 'Norma Shearer' (qv) and producer 'Darryl F. Zanuck' (qv) plucked him out of nowhere to be featured in major supporting roles in two separate movies. His acting career was short as he realized that he was not very good at it, and that his passion lied elsewhere in the movie business. He wanted to be the next 'Darryl F. Zanuck' (qv). In large part due to an article written by entertainment columnist 'Peter Bart' (qv), Evans did become a producer and then ultimately head of Paramount Pictures, one of the then lower tier of the premier movie studios. Evans' place at the studio hinged on the success of a few key movies including _Rosemary's Baby (1968)_ (qv), _Love Story (1970)_ (qv) (working on which sparked the short but passionate personal relationship with future wife, actress 'Ali MacGraw' (qv)), and _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv). Under his tenure, Paramount became the number 1 studio in Hollywood. Those successes led to an unusual contract with Paramount, which in turn led to his return to producing such acclaimed movies as _Chinatown (1974)_ (qv), and ultimately quitting his job at the studio. But Evans' life had some major falls, especially in the 1980's, with the start of his cocaine use, the failure of some highly touted and big budget films such as _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv), and implication in the murder of aspiring producer 'Roy Radin' (qv), which in combination led to major bout of depression. He would need the assistance of his true friends to help him regain his life.
