Sunset Babylon

 In this film-noir comedy-thriller, Private Dick Frank Diamond is hired by hotcha number Mona St Clair to find her brother Baby John, a beatnik bongo banger with a fondness for loco weed. Little do they know he's fallen in with former child stars the Babylon Sisters, a pair of bughouse broads with bats in the belfry and bodies in the cellar. Sunset Babylon is a crazy hepcat ride through the juke joints and lush dives of Old Hollywood-- booze, broads, and Ding Dong Daddies.
