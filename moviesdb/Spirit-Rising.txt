Spirit Rising

 Spirit Rising is a film about self discovery; a film about healing. It delves into a summer of transition for 9 year old Richard Chalsky, a summer that will change his life forever. Ultimately, Spirit Rising is about having the courage to take responsibility for our lives, so that we might once again, find our way back to enjoying them.
