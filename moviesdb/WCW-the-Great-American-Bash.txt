WCW the Great American Bash

 This year's Great American Bash is going to be just that, a bash taking place in the heartland of America. The event this year is headlined by three grudge matches. Diamond Dallas Page got the win over Randy Savage two months prior at WCW Spring Stampede, now Savage wants revenge in a lights out match. Who will win Page-Savage II? In other action, Ric Flair and "Rowdy" Roddy Piper will unite and attempt to take down the nWo's heart by challenging The Outsiders for the WCW Tag Team Championship. Syxx will be in the Outsider's corner, but will he be enough to keep down the veterans of the sport? The third grudge match that will be settled in Moline on June 15th will be a WCW Women's Championship Match between Japan Legend, Akiro Hokuto with the devious Sonny Onoo in her corner going up against Madusa. The Great American Bash is one of the most historic events in pro wrestling, and one thing is for sure, that tradition will continue in Moline!
