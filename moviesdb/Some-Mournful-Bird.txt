Some Mournful Bird

 Set in contemporary Brooklyn NY, "Some Mournful Bird" is a remake of the classic Elia Kazan film "On The Waterfront", coinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release in 1954. In this unique remake, filmmaker Taj J. Musco has preserved the original dialogue and slang from the 1950's, but set his film in the modern day with a younger cast and authentic Brooklyn locations. Set against the backdrop of a corrupt waterfront union, this short film focuses on the inner struggle of protagonist Terry Malloy and the events and people that lead him to discover his conscience. Like the original feature, this film deals with themes of loyalty, conscience, brotherhood, and love.
