The Gas Cafe

 Two travelers, whose car has ended up in a ditch on a stormy night, end up at The Gas Cafe. Located somewhere between Heavan and Hell three people await the travelers. No one is telling the truth in this dark drama that asks the question, is there a heaven, or a hell, or have we just fallen in to mass confusion. The truth, usually unpleasant, comes tumbling out of each character before they can continue on their own personal journies.
