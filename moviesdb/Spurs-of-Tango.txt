Spurs of Tango

 During his journey to the South American countries Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina and Uruguay, filmmaker Henri Plaat had his camera pointed at places that reminded him of the tango, the famous South American dance. In no particular order Plaat shows those places, like a photo collage. No commentary, no interviews, just tango music and a look at South American culture.
