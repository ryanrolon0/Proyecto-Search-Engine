Punar Milan

 Dr. Mohan comes from a decent upper-caste Brahman family. He is of marriageable age, and is in love with Shobhna Bakshi. They plan to get married soon. The marriage takes place, and during this process, someone raises a question about Mohan's caste, and when Mohan is asked repeatedly whether this is true, he replies that he does belong to a lower caste - the untouchables. Everyone is shocked, and the marriage is cancelled, leaving Mohan's family to wonder as to why he claims to be an untouchable person.
