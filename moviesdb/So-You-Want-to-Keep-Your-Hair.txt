So You Want to Keep Your Hair

 A humorous look at how men cope with hair loss. Joe McDoakes starts finding too much hair in his comb. He first asks for advice at the barber-shop. Each barber has a different solution. He reads books on the subject and tries different shampoos, all to no avail. In desperation he visits the 'Mo-Hair Institute', whose motto is "If your hair is unbecoming to you...You should be coming to us."
