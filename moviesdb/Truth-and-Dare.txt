Truth and Dare

 Anna's first day at school. She becomes part of the 'cool gang' and is thrown into trouble. To prove her worth, she is dared to humiliate Eddie, the class loser. She steals his secret diary and posts its pages in the school library for the school to read. It is now up to Anna to make things right. This dramedy was made by the 11-13 year old students of Chisnallwood Intermediate School in Christchurch, New Zealand, and it could make you laugh, cry and think.
