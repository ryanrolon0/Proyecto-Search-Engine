Tornado Range

 Eddie Dean, under orders as a U.S. Land Office agent, is trying to prevent a range war from being started between homesteaders and ranchers when a caravan of the so-called 'Nesters', start to take over land acquired by the homesteaders by a government lease. Quirt Thayer, working both sides against the middle, has his gang join with the ranchers seeking revenge against the settlers for raids on the ranchers by Quirt's henchmen. Eddie uses his friendship with Mary King, daughter of the leading rancher, to pin the guilt on the correct culprits. Homesteaders are moving onto the ranchers grazing land and Eddie has been sent to stop a range war between the two sides. Thayer is after the land and has his men out trying to start that war. When his henchman Dorgan kills Sawyer, Sawyer's son goes for revenge, When Eddie tries to stop him, Dorgan shoots another man and Eddie is accused and finds himself about to be hung.
