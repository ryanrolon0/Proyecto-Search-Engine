Remake

 Steven and Deb are forced to spend the night in a run down Motel after their car breaks down. After several failed attempts at lightening the mood, Steven goes to check out the movie collection in reception. He is greeted by two creepy fellows who thrust some tapes upon him. Returning to the room, they soon realise that the movies they are watching are not the original versions, but remakes made by the motel staff. Under the insistence of Deb, Steven tries in vain to get hold of a 'normal' video, but due to his non-confrontational nature fails and returns with yet another remake. With everything that has occurred, Deb finally loses it and storms into reception to give them a piece of her mind before storming out again. Embarrassed and ashamed, Steven allows the staff to give him one last tape...
