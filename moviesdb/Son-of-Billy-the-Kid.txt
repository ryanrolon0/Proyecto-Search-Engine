Son of Billy the Kid

 It's twenty years after Pat Garrett supposedly killed Billy the Kid. In this version Billy survived and is now a respected banker. Outlaws are after the money in his bank but a whip carrying man dressed in black arrives to help him out and his name just happens to be Garrett. Baldwin City will soon be welcoming the new railroad, but in the meantime, stagecoach driver "Fuzzy" Jones, who is also the sheriff, postmaster and express agent, brings in the mail, money shipments and travelers, such as the town banker, Jim Thorne, and Betty Raines, a dance-hall girl, always on the hunt for a man to marry, and "Fuzzy" is not excluded. The stagecoach is attacked by a gang of outlaws, but they are driven off by a Special United States Marshal, Jack Garret, who happens to be galloping by at the moment. Billy the Kid, under an assumed name, is living in Baldwin City, and Marshal Garret has reasons to know that he is not the man behind the outlaws...but his son might be.
