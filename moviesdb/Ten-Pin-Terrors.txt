Ten Pin Terrors

 Heckle and Jeckle, the talking magpies, have trouble sleeping because they live under a bowling alley. When the bulldog who owns the alley refues to stop the noise, they give him a dose of his own medicine. They put glue in his bowling ball, harrass him at the pool table and place a bomb in his pants.
