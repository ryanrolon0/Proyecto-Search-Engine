Shining God

 A surreal and metaphysical vision rooted in the absurd metamorphosis of two men at polarized ends of the social spectrum. A young shoe-shiner, Kevin, is approached for a shine by a former customer who had long been absent. This former customer, Mr. Roberts, pulls Kevin along in an exasperatingly labyrinthine weave of conversation that culminates in a bizarre transformation of flesh and spirit. Upon arriving at this place of liberal absurdism, the unseen side of the vanishing point is revealed in the landscape of two men profane.
