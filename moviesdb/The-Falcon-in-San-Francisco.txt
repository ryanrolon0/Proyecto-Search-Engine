The Falcon in San Francisco

 On vacation, Tom Lawrence--The Falcon--and his Brooklyn-born sidekick 'Goldie' Locke meet cute with a little girl named Annie whose nurse has just been murdered. Accompanying Annie home, The Falcon is arrested for kidnapping, but bailed out of jail by a mysterious woman (Helm). A labyrinthine plot then unfurls involving silk smuggling, a steamship called the S.S. Citadel and an ex-bootlegger named Duke Monette.
