Proof

 The daughter of a brilliant but mentally disturbed mathematician (recently deceased) tries to come to grips with her possible inheritance insanity. Complicating matters are one of her father's ex-students who wants to search through his papers and her estranged sister who shows up to help settle his affairs. In Chicago, on the day of her twenty-seventh birthday, Catherine receives her sister Claire from New York for the funeral of their father Robert, who passed away a couple of days before. Robert was a brilliant mathematician that became bughouse, and Catherine had lived with him for the last five years, inclusive quitting her studies in the faculty, and she is concerned about having inherited his insanity. The mathematician of the University of Chicago, Hal, is making a research in Robert's notebooks, trying to find any brilliant proof that Robert might have produced in one moment of lucidity. When Hal has one nightstand with Catherine, she gives a notebook to him with the development of a unique mathematics theory that Catherine claims that she developed. Hal and Claire do not believe on her, until the truth is disclosed.
