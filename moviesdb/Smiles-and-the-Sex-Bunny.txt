Smiles and the Sex Bunny

 Mr. Smiles has a dream which he shares with his son, 'We can finally come into our own.' Finding the way from his job as manager of the local small town deli to a future fortune, may be a lotto ticket or his boss's party away. Unfortunately Mr. Smiles chose the latter and ended up the party's amusements. Trying to regain face after being exposed to his son's pride, Mr. Smiles' new plan is to hit the boss where the sun don't shine. This comedy brings out the worst in a relatively calm situation. Taken to the limits by his boring job, Smiles reverts to childish pranks.
