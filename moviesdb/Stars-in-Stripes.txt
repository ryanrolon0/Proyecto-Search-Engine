Stars in Stripes

 The Sisters of the Skillet (Ed East and Ralph Dumke)are in a night club doing their swing act as the sing at the piano. The town sheriff warns them that they can't swing in his town, and when they persist, they and the other performers are thrown into jail. In the jail, they carry on as if nothing had changed, and adapt their specialties to the jail atmosphere. In addition to East and Dumke's "Sisters of the Skillet" act, the other performers include Ada Brown, Carl Freed's Harmonica Band, Jack and Jane Boyle, Phil Seed and Juanita and Her Champions.
