Separation Anxiety

 Separation Anxiety traces the friendship of three twenty-something childhood pals, Quinn, Jess, and Bailey...beginning on the morning of Bailey's funeral. In what appears to be a fatal accident, Bailey fell off the dam where he used to hang out, and the shock of the event devastates everyone close to him in different ways. Quinn, having left their hometown years ago for a job out west, is forced to deal with his grief while stranded at the airport, while Jess spends the morning with Bailey's father, trying to make sense of the tragedy. Quite content to stew in his grief, the emotionally distant Quinn is befriended during his delay by a fellow passenger, a woman named Lily, who knows loss and grief in such a way that Quinn cannot fully embrace. Back home, as Jess searches for answers in her tense dialogues with Mr. Palmer, she finds only more confusion and sorrow, particularly in the form of a letter Bailey left for her prior to his death. As the people who loved Bailey the most grapple with the possibility that his fatal accident might have been something more purposeful, flashbacks from the last days of Bailey Palmer - ever the artist, yet never able to capitalize on it - begin to unravel what was really going on. Quinn and Jess find themselves forced to deal with truths they aren't ready to face, about Bailey and each other.
