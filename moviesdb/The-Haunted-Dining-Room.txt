The Haunted Dining Room

 Two men in a dining room, and a table laden with good things to eat. The men prepare for their meal. They sit down at the table and immediately it begins dancing jigs and going through funny stunts. The dishes are spilled upon the floor. The table flies up in the air and then falls upon them, and the whole dining room is turned topsy-turvy. An exciting scene from start to finish and one sure to please.
