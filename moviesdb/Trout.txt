Trout

 Mari and Alex live in a caravan isolated in a remote field where cattle graze. He's a fisherman, in trouble with his boss; she's a clerk in a grocery. Theirs is an exuberant sex life. She has potatoes cooking on the stove when he comes home from the pub, looped, with plans to tie her up and celebrate getting his job back. But he's neglected to repair a light above the bed, which starts a series of mishaps that may bring disaster.
