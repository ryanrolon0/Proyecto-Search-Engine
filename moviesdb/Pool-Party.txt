Pool Party

 Pool Party is the story of an abandoned WPA swimming Pool, once the largest in the world, brought to life by incredible music that filled its basin for 3 short summers. It's a final celebration of McCarren Pool as a unique venue set at the center of an international music scene in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
