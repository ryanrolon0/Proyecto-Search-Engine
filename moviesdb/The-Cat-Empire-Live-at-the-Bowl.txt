The Cat Empire Live at the Bowl

 DISC ONE Welcome to the SIDNEY MYER MUSIC BOWL MELBOURNE where the weather is perfect, the stage is set, the lights, sound and production are second to none, and Harry has worn a gold tapestry suit for the occasion. This special concert event features THE CAT EMPIRE along with THE EMPIRE HORNS, THE EMPIRICAL STRINGS (4 piece string section), Sergio Ercole guest guitar, NOMADIC FUNK - four incredible hip-hop dancers dancing up a storm, and a troupe of FLAMENCO musicians and dancers who bring their elegance and passion to the stage. DISC TWO We take you where the fans are dying to go - backstage with The Cat Empire. A special behind the scenes view with Will (drummer) and Ryan (Bass) who give you guided tours of life on the road, including tour buses, a rangers view (they are the rangers!) of bears in Canada, and what Glastonbury Festival is really like - dirt and all. This disc also features highlights from a selection of other shows the band has performed in recent years, and rare footage from the very first show they ever played as a six piece. Expertly mixed in 5.1 surround sound. (Encoded to play in All Regions).
