Sensational

 "Sensational" tells the story of Flynn's dalliance with Beverly Aadland, a girl who was being pushed into a movie career by her mother, a wannabe actress whose aspirations were cut short after an accident. After Flynn collapsed and died at a party, the affair became a tabloid staple, and the girl's mother found herself on trial for child abuse.
