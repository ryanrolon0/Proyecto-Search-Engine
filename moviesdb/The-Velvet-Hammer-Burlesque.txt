The Velvet Hammer Burlesque

 The Velvet Hammer wrote the Neo-Burlesque Bible shapes and sizes, glittering costumes, raunchy music, comedy and unadulterated glamour! In between shameless on-stage displays of feminine wiles and intimate behind-the-scenes footage, hear the tassel-twirling, champagne-swilling minxes debate everything from modern feminism to pastie glue.
