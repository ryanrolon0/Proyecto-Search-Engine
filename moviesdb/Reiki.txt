Their members were trained assassins and monks, known for their cruelty. In their possession lay the sword "Reiki", slayer of witches astral-line of witches, disabling their chance for reincarnation. But the sword is lost in the 17th century and The Order are unable to stop the Witches from being re-born. Now for centuries The Order and the Witches have been reincarnating over and over again, fighting their war, until the day "Reiki" is discovered again...
