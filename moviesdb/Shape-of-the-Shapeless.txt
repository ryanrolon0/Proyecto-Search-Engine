Shape of the Shapeless

 Shape of the Shapeless explores the journey of Jon Cory, aka Premdas, aka Rose Wood, through various gender and social roles. By day, Jon Cory is a professional craftsperson, who runs a successful business in New York City. By night she is Premdas, a yogi and a prudent devotee of her Guru. In late nights she performs in various clubs around the city as a burlesque dancer under the name Rose wood. Rose considers herself neither male nor female, and her gender is something she could write and rewrite and believes the body is just a costume.
