RKO Headliner

 Crooner and pianist Gene Austin, band singer Jane Shirley, and his two stooges, Coco & Candy, aren't making any money at their nightclub, so Austin buys a trailer, hooks it to a car, and puts their show on at trailer camps around the country. They meet up with a bunch of kid entertainers, and the combined shows are a hit...on the Trailer Camp Circut.
