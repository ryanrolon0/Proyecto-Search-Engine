Steam Tactics

 Cadets of the United States Navy Academy receiving instructions in steam tactics by the use of launches. The boats go by in double column at full speed, one cadet being at the helm and one at the engine and a third in command. This subject is exceedingly intersting from pictorial as well as educational standpoint.
