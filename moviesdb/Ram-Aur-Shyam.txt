Ram Aur Shyam

 Roshni Raman discovers a scientific formula and as a result gets abducted - first by Jabar, and then is subsequently taken by force by the menacing Tatar. Her widowed mother recruits a male named Ram Luthra to locate and bring her home; while Jabar hires Shyam to try to find and bring her to him. Both men must now not only confront each other but also the invincible Tatar, who has the police and politicians on his payroll, in a fortified city.
