United Imaginations

 Follow the imaginative world of 2 young girls as they symbolically defeat the 'Bad Dragon' who is effecting the land, air and sea. A metaphor of the destructive nature of humankind, but hope through the innocence of children. We hope you like our film and take to heart the message.
