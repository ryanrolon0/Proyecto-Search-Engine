The Pensioners

 Charles Bramwell, aged 65, was a retired army officer bearing the rank of captain. In his old age he had nothing on which to live, save his quarterly pension, and living was high in California. But the captain had two sons Dick, quick, clear thinking, a popular young fellow with both men and women, and Will, slower witted, careless, lazy, and indifferent. One day a message came while the captain sat under the trees in his yard. The message was short and addressed from a legal firm in the East. It read last will and testament of your late friend, Col. W. A. Reiggs, we are sending to your care his two daughters in accordance with your understanding." The daughters arrived. Clarice proved haughty indifferent to others and quarrelsome. Madge, on the contrary, soon showed herself a kind and thoughtful girl and in many ways the direct antithesis of her sister. Curiously enough, Dick found himself drawn strongly toward Clarice. But a change was coming over Will. He no longer neglected to carry water, bring the firewood and do the chores about the house. There grew up a comradeship between him and Madge, brought about, no doubt, through the fact that all the household work was thrown upon their shoulders. Then a day came when neither Clarice nor Dick could be found. Finally, the aged mother discovered a note, which explained the mad infatuation and brought the sorrowful news that the family could expect nothing more from Dick or Clarice. But Will, with one arm about his mother's shoulder and the other caressingly thrown around Madge, assured her that the black sheep had turned white and that thenceforth he would assume his brother's place.
