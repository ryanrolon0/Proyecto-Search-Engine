The Good the Bad & the Horny

 The game of Cowboys and Indians takes on a new meaning when the cowpokes (guys) take on the Indians (girls) in a sexy free-for-all to find out if those oil' six-shooters are really better than a quiver full of arrows. In reality, Steve runs a dude ranch in the mountains and after teaching Susie the finer points of horsing around, he challenges this rich Beverly Hills brat and her friends to a game of search and enjoy. The cowboys are up to the challenge, but the Indian princesses head 'em off at the pass. Watch and see who comes out on top!
