Revenge of the River

 Imagine a place on the verge of squandering its treasure. On the brink of destroying its splendor. The place is Florida, the treasure is the St. Johns River and the gloomy scenario just given is much closer to grim reality than you might think. Repairing a sick river is enormously complex. And it brings a breathtaking cost. In the meantime, our river's not waiting on us. Its dilemmas grow daily. Unless a massive intervention takes place, the river will start acting out. Indeed, it already has.
