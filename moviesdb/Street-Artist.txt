 The G40 Art Event took place in a building that was slated for renovation and was sponsored by the Crystal City BID project. This picture has pledged support from the Crystal City BID project, Art Whino, and over 500 artists that participated in the event. If selected, the screenings will definitely sell out with sponsored parties to celebrate this effort.
