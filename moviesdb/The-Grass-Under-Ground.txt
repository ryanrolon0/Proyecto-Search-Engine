The Grass Under Ground

 Guy and Eve are in a long term relationship that started in their college years. Now approaching 30, Eve questions their reliance on getting high every day, and decides to quit. She makes this decision without consulting Guy, and on a night they are expecting a delivery from Faith, the courier for the drug delivery service they frequent. What ensues not only tests their relationship, but the basis for how they live their lives. Shot in New York City using practical locations and a verite style, The Grass Under Ground explores a quintessential aspect of city living, namely, the way drug delivery services make addiction easy while providing an escape from being an adult.
