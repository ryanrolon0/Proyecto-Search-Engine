This Time

 Every dream has a soundtrack. THIS TIME is an emotional music-driven portrait of faith and fearless creativity, following six diverse musicians as they struggle to make peace with past disappointments in order to find the strength and determination to continue to follow their dreams. Some famous, others never having been or all but forgotten, the musicians are the legendary Atlantic Records recording artists The Sweet Inspirations (best known as back-up singers for Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield and countless others), New York cabaret sensation Bobby Belfry, R&B diva Pat Hodges (of Hodges, James & Smith) and producer/composer Peitor Angell, each poised on the brink of their next moment in the spotlight. Also featuring an appearance by original Sweet Inspiration and gospel star, Cissy Houston, the mother of Whitney Houston. As the artists attempt to define success and battle self-sabotage, THIS TIME celebrates their widely ranging gifts to tell the story of the transformative power of creativity. Filmed over a period of four and a half years, and woven around a soaring soundtrack, THIS TIME is an uplifting story of hope, persistence and the indomitable power of faith.
