The Sleep Study

 The Sleep Study explores the multiple dimensions of a human personality in the state between the unconscious and the conscious. The multiple narratives (of Joy, Holly and Christian) revealed through the sleep test serve as personifications of the distinct sides of the protagonist Natasha. The twist and non-linear style aim to capture the discrepancy of making conclusions out of context and the general misjudgments and oversimplifications often made over people's characters.
