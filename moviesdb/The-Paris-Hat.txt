The Paris Hat

 There is no confirmed documentation that any film bearing this title was ever produced or distributed at this time. Most likely the correct title is The New York Hat (1912). Lionel Barrymore did not enter films until 1911, but did, indeed, appear in The New York Hat the following year.
