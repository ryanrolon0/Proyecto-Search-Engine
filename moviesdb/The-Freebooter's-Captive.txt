The Freebooter's Captive

 A thrilling picture in which the chief of a group of bandits carries away a pretty girl from her home and takes her to his castle. He forces his attentions on her but is repulsed. An opportunity arises for her to pour poison into the chief's wine, but having seen her do it, the chief changes the glasses and asks her to drink the poison intended for him. As she is about to take it, he takes compassion on her and releases her. After the girl leaves the castle, he drinks the poison himself.
