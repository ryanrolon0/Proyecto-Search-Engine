The Taming of the Shrew

 Baptista has two daughters Bianca, but nobody's much interested in problem child, Kate. Baptista declares that he won't give Bianca away in a marriage until he's found a husband for Kate, so all the suitors begin busily hunting out a madman who's willing to do it, and they find Petruchio it wealthily in Padua. And Petruchio marries Kate with a plan to tame her, while everybody else begins scheming to win Bianca's hand. Baptista will not allow his saccharine younger daughter Bianca to marry until someone can rid him of his obstreperous older daughter Katherine. The swaggering Petruchio, eager to wive it wealthily in Padua, agrees to do just this. Meanwhile, Bianca has three suitors the youngish Hortensio and the young and handsome Lucentio.
