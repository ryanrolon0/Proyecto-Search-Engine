Team Spirit

 Team Spirit is a film about friendship, loyalty, growing up and making choices. The story centers around a group of friends (and girlfriends) who have been playing football together for over 10 years, and who are now getting everything ready for their 500th match. As it turns out, they have changed during the past ten years and they will be confronted with their choices, their priorities and the consequences that this will have on their lives. Team Spirit is, therefor, NOT a soccer film. It is a film about people on the brink of new stages in their lives.
