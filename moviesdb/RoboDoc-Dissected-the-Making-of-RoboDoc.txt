RoboDoc Dissected the Making of RoboDoc

 RoboDoc Dissected the Making of RoboDoc takes you behind the scenes of the making of the movie RoboDoc. Writer/Producer of RoboDoc Dr. Doug Gordon and Actor Dr. Lucky Meisenheimer dissects the movie making process and clearly demonstrates just how similar making a movie and medicine are to each other. Do you know what a gaffer, grip, boom guy or fluffer does? Well neither do we, and you probably won't learn that watching this featurette, but you may discover how to produce and direct your own multi-million dollar film and get rich while doing it. Or you may just want to have another beer. Either way it's okay by us, just watch the film.
