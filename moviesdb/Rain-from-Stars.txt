Rain from Stars

 It's the bone chilling story of an old man who recounts a terrifying tale to his friends that happened to him back in the 1940's during the trial of one of the most brutal murders of the era. As the jurors deliberate over the details, one by one they begin to disappear in what appears to be a fully contained and locked room. As he continues to tell the story we find out that not only do all the jurors have something in common with the murder, so do the men he's telling it too.
