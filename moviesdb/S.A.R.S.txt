 In 2005 the Avian Bird Flu was discovered in the United States and Canada. In 2009 the Bird Flu jumped to insects, primarily flies and cockroaches. Their bite was toxic and infected children who in turn passed the disease to adults. This endemic created a new form of SARS. It is now the year 2015 and the disease has spread worldwide. Highly contagious, the virus invades the nervous system immediately, permanently paralyzing the carrier. The chance of death is 100% and there is no antidote. Worse still the victims become zombies. With global population at less than 1000 inhabitants it's hard to recognize humans from reanimated corpses.
