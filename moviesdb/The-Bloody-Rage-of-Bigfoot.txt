The Bloody Rage of Bigfoot

 From the creators of Pus-E The Clown and Brandy or Freedom comes this heart stopping ride through a world where the science of Cryptozoology careens headfirst into the ancient and forgotten works of witchcraft. Two escaped convicts -- the alluring Loosey-Fur and the sexy but unstable Satantha -- seduce and kidnap one of the world's leading experts on Sasquatch. Under the rule of their dark lord, they indulge in a wild sex-and-killing spree, dragging the captive along into the ultimate confrontation with the object of his lifelong quest. Will they survive THE BLOODY RAGE OF BIGFOOT?
