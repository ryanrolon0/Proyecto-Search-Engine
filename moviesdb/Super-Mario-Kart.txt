Super Mario Kart

 Mario, his brother Luigi and all his friends Princess Toadstool, Toad, Yoshi, King Bowser, (his arch-nemesis), Koopa Troopa, and the almost forgotten Donkey Kong Jr. are all in a race to challenge each other and see who's the best racer ever in the Mushroom Kingdom! They'll need to do whatever it takes to collect many power ups like mushrooms to speed themselves up; throw Koopa shells or banana peels at their opponent's to slow each other down, plus many more items in fun and excitement racing adventure.
