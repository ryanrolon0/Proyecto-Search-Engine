The Song of the Morrow

 The film tells the story of the Daughter of Duntreen who had "No power upon the hour and no thought upon the Morrow". A strong Pre-Raphaelite influence dominates the visual style, and the language mirrors Stevenson's text. Years pass and characters come and go, but when the Daughter finally realizes that she has "Power upon the Hour" - it is all too late.
