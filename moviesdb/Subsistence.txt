Subsistence

 An old woman, Kyoko, emerges from her underground garden to pass on the knowledge given to her from the past. A young woman, Jun, is drawn in by Kyoko and lets herself be taught how to prepare and cook. In one bliss filled moment they share a meal, but it is quickly broken as the authorities approach. Kyoko urges Jun to run but not before she points the way to her underground garden. Kyoko is taken by the authorities and put into a cell, while Jun inherits the garden. At the same moment Kyoko remembers the first time she had real food, an experience she passed on to Jun, and smiles away the emptiness of the cell and her fate.
