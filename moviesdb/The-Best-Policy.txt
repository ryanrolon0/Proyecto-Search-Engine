The Best Policy

 Three gentlemen are seen forcing their way through the thick semi-tropical growth of Southern California. The dilapidated trio bears the names of Boggs, Briggs and Boswell. They camped. They slept--or pretended they did. Boggs and Briggs, determined to appropriate all they had, thus leaving Boswell free. But Boswell overheard and, while the older robber went away to place the treasure in a hollow tree, Boswell bitterly upbraided his companion. So, Briggs relenting, the pair decides to give the old man the double cross. Proximity of the rangers prevented Briggs and Boswell from retiring very far into the underbrush; hence old Boggs overhears and decides to double-cross both of them. So he leaves the treasure in the tree and places in his vest a false package. Then Briggs held him up and secured what he thought was the treasure. Finding it all his own, he sees no necessity for sharing it with Boswell. A chase ensues.
