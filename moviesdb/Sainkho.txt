Sainkho

 At a time of globalisation and reclining traditions, the film "Sainkho" is an attempt to investigate the ways artists deal with the phenomenon of missing links. Sainkho Namchylak is a exceptional singer and musician from the far deserts of the Tuva, a small country on the border to Mongolia. She has created an outstanding style that combines musical traditions of her Nomad past with influences of her present in a world of drum'n'bass, hipp-hopp and jazz. London, Rome, Berlin, Vienna and the breathtaking landscapes of the Tuva are the backdrop for a journey that explores the source of Sainkhos' inspiration and talent. Sainkho Namchylak is an icon of a generation that bridges the gap between the Modern and the Traditional.
