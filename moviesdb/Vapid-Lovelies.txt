Vapid Lovelies

 Vapid Lovelies follows a pair of young gay men on their quest for the perfect Sundance outfit. Self-proclaimed fashion designers Skyler and PJ, armed with thread, bobbin, hyperactive imaginations and massively inflated egos, attack life (and their straight neighbor) with fierce ferociousness and ferocious fierceness.
