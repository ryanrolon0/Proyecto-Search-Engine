The Hypochondriacs

 A hypochondriac, convinced she's dying, tells her husband that if she knew he'd have a new wife who would make him happy, she'd die peacefully. She then proceeds to get three of her ugliest friends for him to choose from. The husband, however, has his own idea of who his "new" wife will be.
