Samaj Ki Bhool

 Unusually violent film for its time advocating widow's right to remarry. The crooked Daulatram (Jamsehdji) sells his daughter Chandramukhi (Dulari) in marriage to Banwarlal. Distraught, her mother commits suicide. Banwarlal is poisoned by his nephew who fears the new wife might produce an heir, and Chandramukhi is forced into prostitution. Her father, now a beggar, chances to see his daughter in this condition and he too commits suicide. The nephew then kills Chandramukhi's brother Dayaram (Kader) in an argument and Chandramukhi is arrested for murder. The sorry tale ends happily when the good lawyer Raghuvir (Ghaznavi), Charamukhi's original suitor, rescues her in court. The film ends with debates for and against widow remarriage and with Raghuvir marrying Chandramukhi.
