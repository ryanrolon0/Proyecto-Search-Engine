The Life Before This

 In Toronto, after a holdup goes awry, two gunmen kill or wound several people at a cafe. A flashback takes us through the victims' day. Sheena, a talkative woman approaching middle age, vacillates about showing up for a blind date. Jake, an attorney who has "borrowed" from a client's trust fund, faces ruin when she dies. Maggie, the ugly-duckling daughter of a TV star, gets an audition on her own and may be late for her shift at the cafe. A laconic bug exterminator, grieving for his dead daughter, goes through a day of pain and memory. Two prepubescent girls set up an elderly teacher on a charge of sexual impropriety. Can any make decisions that change the shooting outcome?
