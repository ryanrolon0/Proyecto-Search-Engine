Slate and Kelly

 Misfits Slate and Kelly are wannabe police officers who both get kicked out of the police academy - Slate for being over-zealous with her weapon; Kelly for being too scared to pick his up. When drag queens start showing up dead and the police are unable to infiltrate the community to find the killer, Slate and Kelly pair up to bring the serial murderer, nicknamed the BOA-CONSTRICTOR, down.
