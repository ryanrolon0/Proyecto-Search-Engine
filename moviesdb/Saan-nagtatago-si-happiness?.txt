Saan nagtatago si happiness?

 Crazy and heartwarming! Finding happiness isn't part of Tikyo's everyday plan. For him, at the age of 50, nothing is as simple as selling sorbetes, his only source of living. Everything's just perfectly fine. Until, breaking news comes-his mother, whom he believed, for so long, was already in heaven, is still alive. Dogged and eager, Tikyo will do everything to reconcile with the woman he loves the most-from the long queue in the TV studio to the chaotic newsroom of a radio station to the lunatic and hysterical fortune teller. Every effort, he does with the help of his best bud, Nene, the problem child of the tenement. His world will be lost in confusion when the girl of his dreams comes, Sara, fresh and charming. The 50-year old guy is now torn between finding his mom and pursuing the young woman's heart. Tikyo believes that true happiness will come to him if he'll be successful in winning the two women. Tikyo must find his way to happiness, lead other people to it or redefine its true meaning.
