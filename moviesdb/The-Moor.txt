The Moor

 One night at a restaurant, Warren Lowe notices a striking older woman celebrating her 80th birthday. He's seen her before. Thirty years earlier, when she was 49 and he was 19, they were entangled in an intense, secret love affair, which ended when Gail moved away. As he struggles to connect the vivacious, middle-aged woman of his past with the old woman he sees now, the two of them take a bittersweet journey through time, place and memory. "The Moor" is a haunting tale about love and loss, youth and old age, dreams and disappointments, truths and lies.
