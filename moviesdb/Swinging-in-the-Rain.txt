Swinging in the Rain

 It is 1926. The Horny Bothers have just released the first adult "talkie" entitled "The Jazz Swinger." Now, in order to compete, Paramounds Dirty Pictures has sent a mandate down to their top director, Cecil B. DeBalls. His next sexual extravaganza must be all-singing, all-dancing, all-screwing! It will star the studio's hottest sex team, Gina LaMont and Don Lockwood. It can't miss! Or can it? No one at the studio knows how to make a "talkie." And, worse, Gina may be good to look at, but she has a voice that is better suited for hailing cabs in New York city!
