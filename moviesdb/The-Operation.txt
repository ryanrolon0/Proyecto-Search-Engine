The Operation

 In a cold tile operating room, a surgeon clad in a protective Ty-Vek suit, goggles and tight rubber gloves demonstrates her skill before a group of observers. They scrutinize the eerie coupling between the surgeon and patient, whose bodies merge like molten lava. Explicit radioactive sex draws the viewer into an erotic experience that probes beneath the boundary of skin.
