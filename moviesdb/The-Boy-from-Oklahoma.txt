The Boy from Oklahoma

 Tom Brewster, handy with a rope but not a gun, rides into town and mails his lawyer's exam. When his lack of ability with a gun is exposed, the town boss Turlock offers him the job of Sheriff but he refuses. When the mail is robbed leaving him without a job to ride to, he changes his mind. But Turlock has misjudged Tom and Tom without a gun is soon on the trail of the former Sheriff's killer and it will lead to Turlock.
