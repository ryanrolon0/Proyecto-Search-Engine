Square Shooter

 Having been framed for murder, Tim returns from prison to clear his name and retrieve the ranch taken from his uncle with a forged will. He finds the real will but his friend Johnny becomes jealous when he sees Tim with his girlfriend and gives Tim's hiding place away to the men responsible for Tim's trouble. Tim Baxter has served prison time on a frame-up and is returning to King City, with his pal Johnny Lloyd, seeking retribution for that and the loss of a ranch he was willed by his uncle Sid Cameron. They meet Sally Wayne in the cafE she operates. She and her father, Doctor Wayne are old friends of Baxter's and he is in love with her. Tim is unaware that Johnny has also fallen in love with Sally and she with him. A forged will has given the ranch to Jed Miller and he and town banker Ezra Root, who have cleaned out the Cameron bank account with forged checks, aren't happy about Baxter's return. The latter organizes a band of men who have also been victims of Miller and Root, and they loot the latter's property and turn the gains over to the victimized town folk. Tim slips into the Cameron ranch house and finds the original will leaving him the ranch, and turns it over to Sally for safekeeping. Johnny, thinking Sally loves Tim, goes on a drinking spree and Miller taunts him into leading Miller's gang to Tim's hideout. Tim and Doctor Wayne are captured and taken to the ranch and taken to the ranch as prisoners until they disclose the whereabouts of the original will. Will Johnny sober up and right the wrong he has done to Tim?
