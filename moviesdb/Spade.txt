Spade

 The first of "The Spade Movie Series" which is a series of films written and directed by Oliver O. Mbamara aimed at bringing awareness, recognition, and respect for African values and tradition. SPADE address the issue by artifacts as an integral part of African culture and tradition that should not be forgotten or abandoned to those who simply engage in commercial artifact dealings, and (2) bringing awareness to the illegal trafficking of women across the world, so as to end, or at least, reduce the trend.
