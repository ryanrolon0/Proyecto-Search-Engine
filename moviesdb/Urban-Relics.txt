Urban Relics

 Low budget flick examines the lives of a group of bumbling Boston hoods. When the local hustler hires his buddy to steal a rug to replace one ruined by painters, the thief gets caught after already spending his buddies' money. Furious, the hustler then hires his cousin to kill the thief. However, that goes awry, as well, and the thief dies but not from anything the killer did, but the hustler becomes the chief suspect in the death. In an odd spin, the dead thief becomes a guardian angel for the other men which leads to a happy ending.
