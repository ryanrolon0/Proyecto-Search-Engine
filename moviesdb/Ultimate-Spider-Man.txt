Ultimate Spider-Man

 In this game, you play in the Marvel Ultimate Universe where Peter Parker is a young teenager trying to lead a normal life despite the fact that he's the Amazing Spider-Man. In addition, you also control Eddie Brock, a childhood friend who took a prototype experiment of his and Peter's fathers to become the murderous monster, Venom. While you help the innocent among your challenges as Spider-Man, you also rampage as Venom as events build to a final confrontation that both allies like Nick Fury or enemies like The Vulture cannot prevent. 15 year old Peter Parker and Eddie Brock Jr. are best friends. That is until one day Eddie Brock Jr. steals a formula that was created by both friends' fathers. When Eddie turns into the monstrous Venom and is chased by secret organizational leaders like Nick Fury and Silver Sable, it is up to Spider-Man to help him (least they destroy each other). All the while Venom has a burning hatred for Spider-Man.
