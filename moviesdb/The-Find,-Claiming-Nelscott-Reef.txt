The Find, Claiming Nelscott Reef

 A new surf break is discovered in the Pacific Northwest and turns out to be one of the 5 largest ridable waves in the world. The dilemma for the surfer that found this wave is whether to keep it secret or tell the world. He decided to tell the world by holding a world class professional big wave contest. He opened Pandora's box by doing so, and created a lot of anger with the local surfers. The Find, Claiming Nelscott Reef, is a documentary about the first 4 years of the Nelscott Reef contest, the controversies over the decision to have the event, and the localism that it created to protect this surf break.
