Season of the Hunted

 Five regular guys from Long Island, NY head out on a boys weekend to upstate New York for a weekend of bow hunting. Steve, a New York fireman (post 9/11), organizes the trip for a much needed R & R. It turns sour when their hosts turn out to be a cult group of cannibal hunters. After realizing our boys ARE the hunted, Steve survives the struggle of his life and returns home to Long Island safely to his pregnant wife with the help of his friend Frank. Frank calls on his black-ops Vietnam training, while struggling with his own issues, to get them out alive
