The Ranch

 John Reeves commands his grandfather's Texas mega-ranch. Seth Reeves, his older brother, long ago abandoned his family legacy to build a private equity firm in Dallas. But now Seth is facing insurmountable debt & is being accused of unethical dealings. When Seth and his wife returns to the ranch in a thinly disguised attempt to regain his inheritance, idealistic patriarch Hud Reeves instantly receives him, but John is skeptical. Hud's failing health brings into question the future of the family fortune. Pressure runs high, relationships turn violent, and wounds of the past rage to the present.
