Street Angel

 In Naples, where prostitutes can pay their rent, Angela is sentenced to a year in the workhouse when she tries to steal(while streetwalking) to pay for medicine for her dying mother. She escapes and is hidden by a circus, where she's a natural talent and meets Gino, a painter. When she breaks her ankle in a fall, her career ends. What can she and Gino do? He wants to go to Naples, but the law may still be looking for her, and Gino doesn't know about her past. Starving artist and a beauty with a secret in this world for them? Angela and Gino are a young couple living in Naples. They met when Gino, a struggling artist, was trying to sell his paintings on the streets and Angela was a performer in traveling street carnival. One of his first declarations of love to her was a portrait he painted of her in an angelic pose. To make ends meet, they ultimately have to sell that painting. Just after their engagement and just after he receives an important commission which would make their lives more comfortable, Angela's past catches up with them. It is a past that includes criminal behavior - albeit done out of love and a need for survival - and one of which Gino knows nothing. It threatens their life, not only in not being able to be together but the also in the love they have for each other. The angelic painting may prove to be their ultimate salvation.
