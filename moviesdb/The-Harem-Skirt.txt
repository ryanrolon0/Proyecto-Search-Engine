The Harem Skirt

 This picture depicts the experiences of a wearer of the harem skirt. She passes a couple of boys who trail after. A crowd gathers, and the urchins, curious to ascertain the texture of the new harem skirt reach for the same, attract her attention in such wise that she turns around, sees the crowd following, and with a view to escaping the undesired attention of her modeled skirt, starts to run away from them. She eventually arrives home where she finds that she has forgotten an important social engagement with some social friends of hers, and in consternation ascertains that she will not have an opportunity of changing her dress. Her experiences after leaving the dress making shop, however, have been such that she hesitates to appear in the presence of her friends in her harem skirt so she compromises by donning an ordinary walking skirt which virtually hides the bizarre effect of the new innovation. In her new commonplace attire, she attends the reception being given by her friends, and from this point in the reel to the end, the situations are unique, original, and above all extremely funny. On account of the peculiar construction of her harem skirt, the lady naturally is not afraid of mice and astounds her friends at her fortitude in the presence of the small enemy. The reception is virtually broken up by the cry of fire and the advantages of the harem skirt are fully set forth in the ease with which our comical heroine descends the fire escape. The lady of the harem skirt eventually returned home to her husband, who has been awaiting her arrival for a couple of hours--on an empty stomach, and who is prepared to reprimand her severely, but upon seeing the apparition that confronts him upon her sauntering unconcerned into the sitting room, faints away.
