Schminki 1, 2 + 3

 The way in which bodies can be manufactured is illustrated by the act of putting on make-up. The application of lipstick seems to be directly related to crossing the legs and a number of poses which are identified as being feminine. Such images are permeated with a performative character, as the construction of gender is put on display. In making-up 1, 2+3, a woman dressed up in women's clothes exhibits her own construction process. (Christa Benzer)
