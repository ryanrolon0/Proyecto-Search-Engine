Taking a Stand

 Timmy, an openly gay high school student, is being harassed by two bullies. Shawn, a Christian student, intervenes. Little does he know what he's gotten himself into. The Christian Club questions his loyalty, the gay students think he accepts their lifestyle, the bullies want revenge, and his teacher is not happy with him reporting the incident to the principal. What will Shawn do next?
