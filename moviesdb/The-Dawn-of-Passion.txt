The Dawn of Passion

 Away off, miles from civilization, lives Margy Cotter and Jim Walthers. Thier respective families were the only ones for leagues about. Then a party of cowboys arrived and the leader awoke the first faint dawn of feeling in the pretty, almost primeval, Margy Cotter. He died a violent death, that careless cowboy, and by the hand of the almost primeval man, Jim Walthers.
