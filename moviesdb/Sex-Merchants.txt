Sex Merchants

 Snobby British author and boozer, Harlan Harkelstein, author of "I'm Okay, You Screw For Cash," visits a porn set with his "news" camera crew and looks in on a Cash Markman production, taking pleasure in finding fault with everyone and everything ... especially since the women won't flirt back.
