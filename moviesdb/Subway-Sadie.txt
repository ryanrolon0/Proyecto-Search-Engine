Subway Sadie

 Sadie Hermann, employed in a big New York fur store, dreams of escaping from the early-morning alarm clock and the twice-a-day subway crush. One night in a subway jam she is catapulted into the arms of Herbert McCarthy, a subway guard. It is love at first sight and Herb asks her to marry him. Then her boss announces she is going to be sent to Paris for a fashion show. Sadie has a problem...marriage or Paris?
