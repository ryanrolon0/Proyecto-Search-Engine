The Thrill Hunter

 Cowboy Buck Crosby is a big blowhard and a liar. His supposedly great race car driving and flying feats gets him invited to co-star with Marjorie Lane in a Western. He survives the auto racing scene but is exposed as a hoax when he tries to fly an airplane. Leaving in shame, he gets a chance to redeem himself when outlaws kidnap Marjorie.
