Tovarishch Abram

 One of a series of short Bolshevik propaganda films, Comrade Abram focuses on Abram Hersh, a young Jewish pogrom survivor who became a factory worker and organizer in Moscow and eventually rose to leadership in the Red Army. This short film emphasizes Hersh's suffering and heroism as both worker and Jew, and promotes solidarity over anti-semitism.
