Should Sailors Marry?

 A Wrestler and his ex-Wife (Noah Young and Fay Holderness) try to con a recently-discharged Sailor (Clyde Cook) out of 4 years' pay. When they learn that he lost the money in a 'shell game', they put him to work in the hazardous job of a High Steel Worker, and insure him against accident, then try to see that he has one.
