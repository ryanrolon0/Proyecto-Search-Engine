The Lifeguard

 Old Orchard Beach is a beach community on the coast of Maine. Jake is one of the many lifeguards working the posts. The film focuses on Jake's last summer before he goes off to college. On one of his last nights on his post, he reflects about his family, love, enemies and friends. Garnering lessons from his anecdotes that help him battle with his confusing perception of what 'destiny' could possible be. He's socially awkward but has a certain charm that helps evade the painful abuse of his stepfather & the teen angst driven heartbreak he suffered from his first love.
