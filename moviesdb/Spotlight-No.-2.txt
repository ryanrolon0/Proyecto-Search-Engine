Spotlight No. 2

 A quartet of feature stories about Canada and its people. The first segment highlights "Famous Faces", that is, clocks seen by thousands of Canadians every day. The other segments include a story on gold mining in the town of Yellowknife; a profile of Canadian humorist 'John Pratt (I)' (qv); and a look at the Tip Toppers Club, an organization for tall people.
