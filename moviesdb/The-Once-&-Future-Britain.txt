The Once & Future Britain

 The premise of this short shows us a Future Britain of 2024 where expressions of cultural diversity in the form of religious and cultural holidays have been banned. Difference has been near eradicated and cultural celebrations are now forbidden in favour of creating a more 'passive' and 'socially cohesive' nation in the name of 'Peace' or sedate Universalism. Could this be the Future? Time will tell, as Mankind seems destined to repeat the mistakes of his past.
