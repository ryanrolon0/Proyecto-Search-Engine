Silent

 Reminiscent of "Pleasantville", in this Gothic comedy heroine Abigaile Archibald suddenly develops a speaking voice in a world that is otherwise silent. Delighted, she secretly indulges in the joys of talking and singing -- until the townspeople launch a witch hunt to find the source of the mysterious sound.
