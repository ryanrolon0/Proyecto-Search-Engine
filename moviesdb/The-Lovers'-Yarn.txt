The Lovers' Yarn

 This is a piquant scene of exceptional value for Mutoscope work but not unsuited to the projecting machine. The lover is alone with the girl of his choice and she keeps him busy holding her skein of yarn while she windws the ball. The young man becomes ardent and interrupts the work with passionate love-making. Unfortunately the young woman's foot becomes entangled in the yarn just as her mother enteres unexpectedly, and as the young man clings to the skein as he hurriedly arises, he inadvertently lifts the girl's skirts, at the same time disclosing a trim ankle.
