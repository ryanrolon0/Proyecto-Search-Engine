Shalosh Nashim

 This penetrating documentary produced for Israeli television looks at the lives of three Jewish women writers Schrobsdorff, and Inge Deutschkron. All three grew up in pre-war Berlin, until Nazi racial laws shattered their lives. Uprooted and cut off from family and friends, all three women made their way to Israel, where they became accomplished journalists and authors. The film follows the unique paths taken by each of these women in her quest for identity and the meaning of life in the aftermath of their dreadful wartime experiences.
