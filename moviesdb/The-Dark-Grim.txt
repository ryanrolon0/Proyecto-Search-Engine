The Dark Grim

 Jason Berks thought he'd solved Johnstown's vampire problem for good. Thirteen years after Jason sacrificed himself to rid the town of the demons, the abandoned mine where he buried their bodies is reopened- and four empty body bags spell bad news for Johnstown once again. The vampires, led by Rigo, kidnap Jason's mother and terrorize the town in retaliation for their years of suffering. Now, Jason's younger brother, Jimmy Berks, must awaken his half-man/half-vampire brother and deal with the wrath of the bloodsuckers... this time with the help of some friends. Led by ex-hockey star and crazed psychopath J-Mack, Berks and a vampire-killing posse load their shotguns, sharpen their stakes, and wait for the sun to go down so they can finally send these monsters back to hell.
