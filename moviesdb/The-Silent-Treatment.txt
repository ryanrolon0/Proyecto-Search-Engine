The Silent Treatment

 It's the morning after a party at Bill and Sara's house. Bill wakes up with a sore head, a bruised face and no real memory of what happened. Sara is no use to helping him remember, as she is not speaking to him; although Bill can't stop talking. As he talks he begins to work out that somehow she may have found out about something he did with another woman.
