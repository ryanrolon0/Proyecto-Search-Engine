Pookums

 Beth is trying to just make a little money. She gets an easy opportunity, all she has to do is house sit and look after the fancy dog, Pookums. If something were to go wrong, how bad could it get? A dog, a busker, a house sitter, a dog owner, the neighbour, and a thief all collide in this romp that is based on a true story. This short examines the reality that life in the big city is often strange and totally unscriptable.
