The Rumble in the Jungle

 Thirty-Two year-old Muhammad Ali takes on what was at that time, one of the most powerful boxers in the history of the sport, in one last shot at greatness. Ali employs his "rope-a-dope" tactic for the first time, but will it be enough to recapture the greatest prize in boxing? Sometimes more entertaining than the actual fight are some of the press conferences Ali held before the fight.
