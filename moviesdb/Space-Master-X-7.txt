Space Master X-7

 A space probe returns to Earth covered with a strange fungus. The fungus is accidentally tinged with human blood and is transformed into an ever-growing pile of space rust, dubbed "Blood Rust". It is up to John Hand and Joe Rattigan to find the one woman who can stop the rust from spreading and taking over the world. Laura Greeling arrives at her ex-husband's home to discuss the custody of their son, a meeting which proves to be very confrontational. While she is returning to her home in Honolulu, she sees a newspaper headline stating that she is wanted in connection with her ex-husband's death! She goes into hiding, thinking that she is wanted on a charge of murder. She doesn't know that she is really being sought because she is the carrier of an extremely deadly virus, which is what actually killed her ex-husband.
