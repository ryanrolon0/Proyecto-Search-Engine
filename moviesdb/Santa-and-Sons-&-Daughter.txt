Santa and Sons & Daughter

 Set in 1980, this digital film musical looks at the futuristic world of Santa, Mrs. Claus and the whole family. The feature introduces nine original songs and a host of new screen talent and elves that work at Santa Claus Inc.'s North Pole Estate and Underground Command Center. Santa's sons, Nicholas (business minded) and younger brother, Klaus (the reindeer tender) - plus spunky daughter, Sandy (Special Projects) rise to the challenge of being the next generation. Sandy flies around in her talking Anti-Gravity sleigh named Blaise. She also falls in love with Zwerkin, the harried inventor of the Teleportation Device that gets Santa into houses without chimneys. Zwerkin, a single father of Bethany and Silvin had to borrow against the house to pay for his wife's funeral. Sadly, he borrowed from his boss, Menacin Snavely. Oh yeah, he also mortgaged his Tele-Santa hand-held video game. It's supposed to be completed on or before December 25th. Trying to save the day, Silvin and Santa's main helper, Jan stowaway in the back of a sleigh to deliver the finished game to Snavely's Lair. Bad decision. Snavely puts on his black Santa-suit and sings about 'deer kabobs and antler soup.' --wish I could tell you more.
