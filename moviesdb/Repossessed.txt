Repossessed

 Possession is nine tenths of the law. Tina Martin, a real estate agent, prepares to show an empty house she's just listed; the client, Alison Labatte, arrives on time and the tour begins. While Tina is peppy and upbeat, Alison is brittle; soon it's she, not Tina, talking about the place had an accident and died after months of costly medical attention; the bank repossessed the house, and the sheriff came to evict the wife. All this is news to Tina, and when Alison suddenly disappears, the unnerved agent goes in search, room by room. Is Alison gone or has she decided to hang around?
