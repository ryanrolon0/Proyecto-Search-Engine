Trust

 An 18-year-old survivor of rape - propelled by theater - experiences a very healthy movement away from identifying herself with that trauma. At age 12, Marlin was raped by two men in the bathroom of her grandmother's church in Honduras. She told no one. Two years later, she immigrated with her older brother Carlos to live with their mother in Chicago, where Carlos repeatedly raped her. She didn't resist - she felt she'd already lost everything but she began going crazy. She confided her secrets to a counselor who recommended the Albany Park Theater Project (APTP), a neighborhood teen theater company that creates original plays from members' stories. TRUST follows Marlin's story from the personal to the public. By Nancy Kelly
