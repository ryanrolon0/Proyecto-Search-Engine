The Sun Also Sets

 After competing in the World Armwrestling Championship, Joshua Davis realized that he'd never have a career as a professional armwrestler. A frustrated career counselor suggested he consider bullfighting and Josh thought it sounded like a good idea. "The Sun Also Sets" follows Josh as he trains in Tijuana and travels through Spain in his attempt to become a real matador. He eventually finds a spiritual home with a troupe of midget matadors - as a result of their teachings, he is approved to give his first public performance.
