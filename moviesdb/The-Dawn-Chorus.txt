The Dawn Chorus

 Bonnie and Lloyd Bukowski. Seats 17C and D. It's been 7 years since the plane crash that killed their parents, but every year Bonnie, Lloyd, and the other survivors return to the site - to reenact, to remember, to try to heal. When they discover this will be the last ceremony, Lloyd clings to the ritual more desperately than ever. Despite her brother's pressure, Bonnie resists. All she can do is remember when all she wants to do is forget. On their final surreal journey through the wreckage, Bonnie and Lloyd will face their memories, their fears and, ultimately, each other. And as dawn breaks, hopefully, they'll come out the other side.
