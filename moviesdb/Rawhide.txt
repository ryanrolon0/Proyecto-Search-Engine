Rawhide

 Vinnie Holt, a single woman with her toddler niece, becomes stranded at Rawhide, a desert stagecoach stop managed by stationmaster Sam Todd and his assistant Tom Owens. Owens is quickly impressed by her independent self-confidence. Jim Zimmerman, a fugitive murderer from Huntsville Prison disguised as a deputy, and three other ruthless escapees take over the station, intent on robbing the next day's gold shipment. After murdering Sam, Zimmerman knows they must keep Tom alive in order to complete their plans. Owens does not correct Zimmmerman's assumption that Vin is his wife, sensing that the misconception might be the key to her survival also. The two staff, at stopover on the route of the California to St Louis mail stagecoach run, are warned that four dangerous outlaws are in the area. Together with a female stage passenger and her baby they wait patiently for the word to go round that these men have been caught.
