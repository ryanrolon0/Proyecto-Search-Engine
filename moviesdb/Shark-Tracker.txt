Shark Tracker

 Marine biologist Richard Fitzpatrick has an unusual "hands on" relationship to working with sharks. When tagging reef sharks, he lassoes the shark by the tail, operates on it and releases it. Richard's next mission to satellite tag a 3.2 metre Tiger Shark, one of the most voracious predators, is a greater challenge.
