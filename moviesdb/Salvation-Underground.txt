Salvation Underground

 Detective Max Caruso, with a sick wife at home, tries his hardest to infiltrate a local drug cartel. The police captain neglects to help with Max's domestic situation by not giving him a raise, which causes Max to realize that he cannot even count on his friends to help. After Max is made by the drug cartel, he barely escapes with his life. Instead of running from the cartel, he decides to take it upon himself to exploit the law, and bring down the cartel on his own terms, with a fake private investigating license.
