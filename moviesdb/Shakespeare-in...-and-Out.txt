Shakespeare in... and Out

 In the 1980s, a filmmaker begins a project to record the life of an average kid. In Perry, Ohio, he picks Rich Longfellow, a shy lad, and begins filming. Soon after, he dies in Mozambique. Sixteen years later, his son continues the project, finding Rich, now 23, in L.A., with dreams of being a Shakespearean actor, getting experience in porn films. We meet Betsy, Rich's sensible girlfriend, Lee, the impatient producer, and Carmichael, a director with artistic pretensions who inspires Rich. Problems with Besty and tension on the set bring Rich to a crisis; when his boyhood friend starts a Shakespeare company that tours nursing homes in the San Fernando Valley, Rich sees a way out. Rich Longfellow is a young aspiring actor who dreams of playing Shakespeare's Hamlet. He moves from a small town in Ohio to L.A., sure he will star in major motion pictures before making his way to England to perform Shakespeare at London's Old Globe Theater. In the meantime, his physical attributes get him an acting job - in the porno industry! He begins a series of low-budget videos entitled, "America's Homemade Sex Videos" and soon moves up to feature-length porns. Eventually, he realizes he's not on the right path toward his lofty Shakespearean goals, so he quits the industry to do "Shakespeare For Seniors", a volunteer group performing Hamlet on a tour of convalescent homes in the San Fernando Valley.
