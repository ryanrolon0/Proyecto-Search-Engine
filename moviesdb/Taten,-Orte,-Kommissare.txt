Taten, Orte, Kommissare

 Starting back in 1970 with 'Tatort - Taxi nach Leipzig' in 1995 the 300th Tatort ('Tatort - Frau Bu lacht') was broadcasted. In the meantime Austria and Switzerland joined the series concept which lets all public-corporate TV channels (WDR, NDR, ORF, Schweizer Fernsehen DRS, ...) have their own pair of police inspectors regularly solve their cases. This documentary takes a look at the past 25 years of the still successful series and interviews some of the actors, as well as writers and program directors.
