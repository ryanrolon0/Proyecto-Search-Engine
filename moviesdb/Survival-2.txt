Survival 2

 A team of filmmakers, actors, and actresses head to the woods to shoot their independent horror film, unaware that they share the woods with a psychotic madman named Rufus Belial who has turned the forest into his personal playground of terror, complete with deadly booby traps and no chance of escape. Life begins to imitate art when the filmmakers are systematically stalked and tortured. But Rufus isn't the only madman inhabiting the forest - the equally dangerous and deranged Johnny Stevens is out for revenge, and the young film crew becomes unwilling pawns in his game.
