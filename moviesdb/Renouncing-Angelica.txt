Renouncing Angelica

 As far as Drew is concerned, he has moved on since Angelica. He has found a new life and new love. But one day, he confirms an unhappy truth about his ex-fiancEe that sets off an intense personal conflict. Now he finds his character tested, his happiness threatened, and he is forced to revisit the past in order to face reality about Angelica's life and death. Renouncing Angelica explores the denial that usually follows heartbreak, and why one must first grieve, and choose to forgive, before one can actually succeed in overcoming a painful past.
