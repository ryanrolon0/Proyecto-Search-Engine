The Heart of a Man

 Frankie, an out-of-work sailor, meets Bud, a tramp who claims he is a millionaire. Bud gives him a shilling and promises him that if he can make £100 from it, he will be given £1,000. Armed with this, Frankie goes off to pursue his singing career and win the heart of Julie, the girlfriend of upper-class criminal Tony.
