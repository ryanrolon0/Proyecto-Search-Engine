The Master Thief

 Andrew wakes up on a kitchen floor with a gun in his hand, a dead body at his feet, and no idea who he is or how he got there. Finding a hotel key in his pocket and having nowhere else to run, he goes to the hotel. Rebecca shows up the next morning and tricks Andrew into helping her break into a house. Angelica catches Andrew and Rebecca in the act and turns the tables on them. Then it gets worse.
