Trapped in the bowels of the garage, Tom realizes he's not alone. Something else is down here. Watching. Waiting. A monstrous 6000 lb Truck whose driver sits hidden behind a veil of tinted glass. A lethal killer with only one agenda hours, a terrifying game of cat and mouse ensues, testing Tom's will to survive and rattling his sanity.
