Take 2

 A woman undresses, alone in her room. She undresses again, this time while watching herself in the mirror. What changes? For decades film has been plagued by what Laura Mulvey called 'the male gaze'. The film, made by a woman and starring a woman, was created to directly challenge that gaze. Although the film documents a young woman undressing, it is not about desire, attraction, or eroticism. Instead, it explores how women view themselves, and how they interact with their reflection.
