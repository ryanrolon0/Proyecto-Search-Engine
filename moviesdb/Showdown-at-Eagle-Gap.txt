Showdown at Eagle Gap

 A western set in Texas in the years after the Civil War. Quell is the leader of a group of honest homesteaders who attempt to right the wrongs that come their way. But when a nasty land mogul by the name of Kirk begins to get out of line by treating the innocent people of the frontier cruelly, he becomes the group's primary target. Whether it's with harsh words or flying fists, Quell and company are the West's most formidable levelers of justice. And nobody, not even the vicious, tyrannical land baron, can stop them from making things right.
