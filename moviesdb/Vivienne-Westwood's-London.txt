Vivienne Westwood's London

 A journey through the British capital led by one of the world's most influential designers. Considered a national treasure, and accorded rare access to London's grandest cultural institutions, Dame Vivienne Westwood is our engaging Host and humorous Tour Guide-proudly showing off the city that inspires her work and gives her life 'meaning and purpose'. Trailing along as she biked, ran, and walked, a Fashion Television crew did it's best to keep up with the energetic 68 year old as she crisscrossed London introducing us to her favorite places; revealing what she does when she's not designing clothes, and teaching us a whole new way of looking at the world in which we live. At the core of this documentary lies Westwood's belief that Culture can save humanity, and by showing us how, we not only travel the city, but tour the mind of Britain's most original and eccentric designer. Fueled by an enthusiasm for London so passionate it's virtually contagious, and featuring animated sequences that bring her ideas to life, we guarantee this will be one tour you won't soon forget!
