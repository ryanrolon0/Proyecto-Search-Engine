Sound of Peace

 "Sound of Peace" is a cinematic meditation. Utilizing the deep resonance of the didgeridoo played by Nawang Khechong, a former Buddhist Monk the film gently, yet powerfully, transforms the viewer's sense of possibility for inner and world peace. A synthesis of viscerally experienced waves of sound and engaging images creates a calm and transcendent experience.
