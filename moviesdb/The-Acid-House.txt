The Acid House

 Three twisted tales from the seamy side of Scotland and the mind of Irvine Welsh. The Granton Star Cause by his football team, his girlfriend and his parents, arrested and beaten up by the police and turned into a fly by God, whom he meets in a pub. The Soft Touch the thug upstairs. The Acid House struck by lightning, causing him to switch bodies with a newborn baby.
