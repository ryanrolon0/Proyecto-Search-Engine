Soaring Eagles

 The Soaring Eagles Native American Indian Dance Group was established by the Southern California American Indian Resource Center to provide a unique cultural learning environment for young American Indian students to learn about about common pow-wow dancing styles, cultural protocols, including how to design and make tribal regalias to help them participate in local San Diego County gatherings and powwows.
