Tum Hi To Ho...

 After the tragic passing of his Goa-based girlfriend, Anna Gonsalvise, Rajiv Saxena loses his mind, and is institutionalized in Our Lady's Home for the Mentally Challenged. After recovering, he is discharged, is shunned by Anna's father, Peter, and even prevented from visiting her grave. Depressed, he attempts to kill himself, but is stopped by Pooja, Anna's look-alike. Both become friendly and she invites him home to meet the rest of the family. He accepts the invitation, but is subsequently devastated when he finds out that she is married to Rahul Sharma. He then deviously sets about to create circumstances that will compel Pooja to marry him.
