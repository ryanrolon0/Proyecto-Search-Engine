Ramble On

 A rambler makes his way across the Welsh Valleys. He is happy that his map, compass, boots and notebook ensure he is well equipped to conquer Nature's challenges. He spies a cheeky bird, is attacked by a caterpillar and tricked by a goat. They conspire to take him on an unforgettable adventure into the depths of a forest and an experience that may change him forever.
