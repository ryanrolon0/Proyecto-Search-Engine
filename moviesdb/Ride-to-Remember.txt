Ride to Remember

 It takes many people in a coordinated effort to pull off the annual Steven L. Levy Memorial "Ride to remember" each fall. Meet the people with the passion that make it happen. Preston L. Forchion shared a birthday with the slain officer and it is that kindred twinship that drives him to keep Officer Levy's memory alive. What happened on the day Officer Levy died? Why is he honored in this way every year? These questions and many more are answered as a community heals its wounds.
