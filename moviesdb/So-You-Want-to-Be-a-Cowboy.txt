So You Want to Be a Cowboy

 Joe McDoakes and his wife Alice attend a western movie and George soon has himself in the movie shown on the screen as Jump-Along Skip-Along McGurk, western terror pitted against an outlaw and his six henchmen, all of whom are named Tex. Since Warners wasn't making any series westerns at the time and since this short was poking fun at such, the lobby poster at the theater was from a Columbia Durango Kid film.
