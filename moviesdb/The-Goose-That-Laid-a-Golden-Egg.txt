The Goose That Laid a Golden Egg

 Dogfather reads about a goose that laid a golden egg, and kidnaps him to make him lay another one. Trouble is, he didn't actually lay the egg (it was an another goose that decided to keep his mouth shut since he knew the fate of the goose in the story "The Goose that Laid a Golden Egg")
