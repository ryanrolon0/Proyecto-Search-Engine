Spirit Spread High

 A young girl tries to gain closure after the death of her mother. She has an idea to take her mother's ashes and spread them everywhere that they went together when her mother was alive. Before she heads out to share the remaining pieces of her mom with the world, she creates a robot in remembrance of her mother. The young girl, the robot, and her mother's ashes travel around as she spreads the ashes everywhere. She gains closure in the end with a relief and a mother who will always float away at sea.
