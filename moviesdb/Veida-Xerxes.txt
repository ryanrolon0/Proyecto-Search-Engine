Veida Xerxes

 The battle lines have been drawn. Decifar and his agents have dominion and authority over the Tulafirmites and their entire plane. Veida Xerxes has the Invisible Esoteric Key; that's all that stands in Decifar's way towards him achieving his ambition of reigning over Tulafirma forever. Tulafirmites have always relied on their comprehension of the six senses to operate on their plane. This is the first battle for eternal dominion that would employ ferocious, but unseen (by the naked Tulafirmite eye) weapons of warfare and twelve year old Veida Xerxes is in the thick of it. At whatever costs, Decifar is determined to get the Key from Veida Xerxes. He will however have to surmount Veida Xerxes' steely resolve and mastery of all the three planes, like he (Decifar) also does, to achieve his aim. Decifar relies greatly on the fact that he had pretty much cornered the very gullible and mortal Tulafirmites. They were his for the taking, he reasons. The stage, like the saying goes, is set for the showdown of all ages...
