The Taming of the West

 Bill Saunders arriving in a lawless town is quickly made Marshal. But when he arrests the gang members, the victims refuse to testify. However one rancher is willing to testify and when the gang kills him, Bill jails the killers. This causes the gang leader Rawhide to reveal the identity of the big boss and Bill goes after him. The latest brawl in lawless Prairie Port ends with saloon gambler Turkey shooting town Marshal Bates. Wild Bill Saunders pursues the killer and brings his dead body back to town, and Coleman appoints Bill as the new Marshal. Outlaws Rawhide and Handy Klemm attempt to rob Pepper Jenkin's sister, Mary, as she is driving into town, her team runs away, and Bill and Pepper find her dead under the overturned wagon. Bill serves warrants on two outlaws and town banker Carp Blaisdale, secretly head of the lawless element running the town, advises them to submit, planning to terrorize the witnesses at the trial. Mrs. Gardner informs the court that her husband, a key witness, is so badly beaten that he can not come to testify. Pepper follows Handy and another henchman and sees them silence the witness with a bullet. Bill arrives in time to save Pepper from also being silenced. Bill begins to suspect Blaisdale as the ring leader and sets a trap to capture him.
