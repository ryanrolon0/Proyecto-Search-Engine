The Sack of Energy

 The Sack of Energy is a 3D animated film on sustainability (or better, the unsustainability of our economic model) based on the comic of the same name devised by Daniele Panebarco with scientific consultancy from Prof. Enzo Tiezzi. It introduces extremely topical themes, and does so in an ironic manner, with the poetic force of fairytale and the evocativeness of music (specially composed for the work). It tells kids, but also adults, a story about human beings, about the origins of life, about absurd and reckless consumerism. The Sack of Energy contains neither recipes nor solutions but puts itself forward as food for reflection, as a point of departure on the necessary road towards a daily life which, farsighted and aware, respects the environment.
