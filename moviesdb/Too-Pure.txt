Too Pure

 After the death of her parents, Nina, the daughter of Cuban immigrants, tries to find the American Dream. She divides her time between her studies, work and a promising affair with Brian, a young man from a decent family. One day, the couple find themselves kidnapped by a gang of brutish drug addicts. Nina, in particular, is the victim of their erratic and sadistic behavior, and as time passes, and the captors don't receive any ransom, her situation becomes increasingly perilous.
