The Rose of Sharon

 Mina Sohn is a Christian, Korean woman living in Los Angeles. She runs a flower shop for a living and ministers to those around as her calling. When a young, Jewish lawyer shows up in need of a florist, the two sense an immediate connection. After a series of dinners and in-depth conversations about Christianity and Judaism, they eventually travel to Israel together where they both explore questions of faith, love, duty, and religion.
