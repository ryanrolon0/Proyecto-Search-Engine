The Battle for L.A.

 Filmmaker Darren Doane ("42K") and a camera, hit the streets of L.A. in an almost guerilla-like fashion and interviews a number of DJs, rappers and dancers. Not only do they give their take on what hip-hop is, what it represents on a personal and social level, but he also attends what is termed "battles" between rappers. While such battles are known to get aggressive from time to time, it is often a way for people to blow off some steam, express themselves, strut their stuff and compete.
