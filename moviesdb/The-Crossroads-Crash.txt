The Crossroads Crash

 Three clownish parodies of the crooks in _Bonnie and Clyde (1967)_ (qv) rob a bank. When the dorky getaway car man gets out after the couple take to long, he tries to grab the money, spilling much of it on the ground. All three manage to get in the car, shooting away as they grab as much of the spilled money as they can. This leads into a narrator discussing various safety rules and signals.
