The Return of Dolemite

 Gunned down by his enemies in the 1970's, bad ass Dolemite comes out of a coma 35 years later in a government lab that has been keeping him young and alive. They want to turn him into an assassin but all Dolemite wants is to get back what was his and get the dudes who set him up.
