The Black Angel

 The Black Angel represents a contemporary approach to the film noir style of the 1940s, relocated in a desolate urban cityscape. The characters carry the same sense of alienation, desperation and nihilism that was synonymous with the traditional films of this genre. The Black Angel also features prominent use of voice-over narration, allowing the viewer access into the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Through an understanding of his neurotic tendencies and personal angst, the audience will hopefully build an empathetic bond with the subject. Employed in this film is a strict black and white palette, this graphic style amplifies the film-noir quality of the subject matter as well as adding an air of mystery.
