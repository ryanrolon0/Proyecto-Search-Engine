Spaces

 Spaces explores visuals found in nature, unique objects, digital effects, three-dimensional shapes and textures mixed with music. Inspired by a song "Montage" by Brad Decker, the visuals are intertwined and layered with each other, adding more space and depth inside the frame. The song provides the feeling of space, direction and presence. The motions of the visuals are in sync with the sounds, reflecting the sense of space and carrying an eerie mood.
