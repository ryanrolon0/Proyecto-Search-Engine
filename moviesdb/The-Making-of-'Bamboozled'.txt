The Making of 'Bamboozled'

 A behind-the-scenes look at the making of Spike Lee's satirical take on the American entertainment industry, in which a black writer for a TV network, frustrated at his failure to get his ideas for a respectable comedy about a black family accepted, presents an idea for a blackface minstrel show, only to have his plan backfire. Includes interviews with director Lee and the rest of the cast and crew, who give their insights into the efforts that went into bringing this film to life.
