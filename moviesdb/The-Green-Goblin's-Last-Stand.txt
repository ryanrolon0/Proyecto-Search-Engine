The Green Goblin's Last Stand

 Life is never simple for our favorite wall-crawlling hero, but it's about to get a lot more complicated. When Norman Osborn returns unexpectedly from the rehabilitation clinic, his sinister alter ego threatens too come back as well. With his spider-sense set on overdrive, Peter Parker races to keep Osborn at ease before his anxiety propels him into Spider-Man's deadliest foe... The Green Goblin.
