Politics Are Murder

 "Politics Are Murder" is a "film noir" comedy mixing dry martinis with politics and murder. Rodney Boland is a professional hit man who "services" politicians and their wealthy backers. When Rodney is hired to kill a blackmailer who has dirt on a U.S. Congressional candidate, it's just another dead body for a fat wad of cash. Or so he thinks until the blackmailer pulls a u-turn on Rodney.
