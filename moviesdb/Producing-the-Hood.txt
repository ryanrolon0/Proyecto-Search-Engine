Producing the Hood

 This documentary contains graphic footage of violence, nudity and drug use. This footage is being released at the request of authorities, victims, families and friends in need of your help in identifying the criminals still at large. Albert, a film student from the east coast decides to become a member of a local LA gang. When he arrives to what he thought was going to be a beat down, he's told there's dirt to be done. He soon finds out that his initiation is to see if he can stand strong and make the tides that bind family together. In the end the initiation turns out to be far more than what he expected or planned to do... in order to survive.
