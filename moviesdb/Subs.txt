Subs

 At Lynbrook K-12, the ones needing the most education and grooming aren't the students, rather they're the teachers, more specifically, the SUBSTITUTE teachers. Brought back to their alma mater by the alumni, their sole purpose at Lynbrook is to log the minimum 12 hours per week required to coach, and bring glory back to the athletic department. Former star athletes and Lynbrook legends, these dysfunctional and unorthodox coaches roam the halls reliving their glory days, all the while instilling the proper values in the students of Lynbrook K-12. Or not.
