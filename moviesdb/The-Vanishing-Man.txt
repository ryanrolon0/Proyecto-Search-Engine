The Vanishing Man

 A man who is serving time in prison for a crime he didn't commit is picked for experiments for sun tanning lotions. What he doesn't realise is that there is a hidden agenda and it's only until he touches water that he finds what the experiment really was. While Nick Cameron is returning to England from the continent with mysterious cargo in the cabin section of his small aircraft, he is thrown off-course by a severe electrical storm and loses radio contact. To his surprise and horror, he is arrested upon landing and accused of being a traitor in connection with the cargo he has been carrying - which, unknown to him, contained plutonium. Although he pleads innocent, Nick is not believed and is sentenced to a long term in prison. While in prison, he is subjected to special experimentation at a mysterious laboratory - with one unnerving, and unexpected, side-effect of the experiments being intermittent invisibility.
