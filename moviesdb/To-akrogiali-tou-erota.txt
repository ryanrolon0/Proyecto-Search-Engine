 Susana is in love with Pavlos and runs a beach bar. They offer refuge to Yiorgos and Eli, a young couple who seem to have run away from home. Trouble begins when 2 more couples arrive at the bay. They have robbed a jewelery store and their purpose is to leave the country as soon as possible. They capture the 2 couples and "have fun" with the women. Afterwards they force Pavlos to help them cross the borders. He flirts with the gang leader's girlfriend and with Sousana's help, he manages to call the police.
