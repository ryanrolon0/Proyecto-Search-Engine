The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora

 A web series starring celebrity chef Cat Cora and the Muppets that debuted online on September 13, 2010. The show was written by Craig Shemin and was said to feature topics like "Food You Can Eat with Your Hands Night" and "Food That Gets Caught in a Mustache Night," as promoted at the D23 Expo in 2009. The working title for the show was "Cooking with Cat Cora". The show stars new Muppet Chef Angelo. "Hasty Tasty Cooking Tips with Cat Cora & the Muppets," another show featuring leaner episodes, both in length and cast, airs on the same channel, as well as on Family.com. Hosts Cat Cora, Angelo and Pepe star, while a chicken appears sporadically. Throughout the series the Muppets constantly make references to how Cat coincidentally already has everything they want to make on the show previously made, calling it "the magic of the Internet."
