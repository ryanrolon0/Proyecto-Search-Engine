Puzzled Pals

 Tom and Jerry are solving a jigsaw puzzle when the stork, frustrated by all the quarantine and "not welcome" signs, leaves a foundling on their doorstep. The tot proves to be more than a handful for them; eventually, he ends up in a closet with a giant vacuum cleaner which causes mayhem. The stork shows up and, disgusted with the job Tom and Jerry have done, decks them and flies off with the baby.
