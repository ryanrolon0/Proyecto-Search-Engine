These Boots Are Made for Walken

 Every time Ronnie gets his heart broken he takes on the persona of one of his favorite actors. This time it's Christopher Walken. Ronnie's brother, Benny, has always been the one to snap him out of it. Unfortunately, this time Ronnie has committed himself to a mental institution. When Benny meets a damsel in distress in the hospital waiting room, he hatches an idea. One that might not only save his brother and free an innocent pooch, but lift the spirits of the damsel's dance-deprived grandmother.
