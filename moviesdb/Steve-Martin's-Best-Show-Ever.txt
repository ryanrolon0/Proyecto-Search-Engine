Steve Martin's Best Show Ever

 Steve Martin's fourth NBC special was in the spirit of his previous association with "Saturday Night Live". It was broadcast live from Studio 8H, produced by Lorne Michaels and featured some original cast members of the show. Sketches included in a womens' art gallery (with Larraine Newman, Lauren Hutton and John Belushi in drag); Martin as "The Elephant Guy" (with Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Lynn Redgrave); Irwin Mainway (Aykroyd) hosts a game show for stupid people (with Newman and Gregory Hines).
