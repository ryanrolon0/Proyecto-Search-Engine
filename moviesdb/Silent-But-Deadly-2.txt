Silent But Deadly 2

 SILENT BUT DEADLY 2 is the sequel to the original. This time around, the stormtroopers are called out of retirement by George Lucas to handle a fan on the edge who's hitting Lucas hard in the pocket by keeping people away from the long lines associated with STAR WARS events. SBD2 won the "Spirit of Fandom" award at the 2003 Atom Films/Lucasfilm Fan Film awards.
