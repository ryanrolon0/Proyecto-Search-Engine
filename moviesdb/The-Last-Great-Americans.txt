The Last Great Americans

 After a record breaking layoff at America's largest fuel distributor leaves Will and Emily without work, they watch as the gas giant, Big Blue, continues to steal from the American people with raising gas prices. Deciding to fight back, Will and Emily get the support of their filmmaker friend, Jimmy. The three set off to make a film of their fight. They begin driving across the country robbing Big Blue stations one by one. They know Big Blue is big, and they can only do so much damage. Soon the police are on their trail as they become skilled in robbery and the getaway. Will and Emily can only go so far and soon this becomes apparent to the crime duo. Along the way they have made a few friends, a hitchhiking maniac, a air-headed high school student, but it is not enough. In a final attempt to hit the gas giant where it hurts, they turn to the media and the American people for one last stand. If the country can stand and fight together, they can show Big Blue that they are not at it's mercy.
