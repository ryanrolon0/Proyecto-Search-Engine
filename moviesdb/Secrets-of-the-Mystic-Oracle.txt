Secrets of the Mystic Oracle

 Finding its themes in Turn-of-the-Century Spiritualist photography, this 1920s period piece follows a naive young man and his pregnant wife on a nightmarish visit to a chiseling fortuneteller. As the soothsayer conjures foreboding visions of creepy plastic babies, aprons and curlers, and a ghostly sailor, the couple experiences a frighteningly surreal vision of their future domestic life.
