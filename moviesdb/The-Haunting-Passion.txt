The Haunting Passion

 Dan was a successful football player, but when his contract expired recently, it wasn't renewed due to his age. Together with his wife Julie he decides to make a new start and they move into a romantic and lonesome house. While Dan starts a second career as newscaster, she's home alone and suffers from frightingly realistic erotic dreams, in which she has sex with an unknown man. Soon this demon even haunts her in broad daylight and attacks friends and husband out of jealousy.
