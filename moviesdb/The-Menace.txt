The Menace

 Ronald Quayle escapes from prison. He was sent there for murdering his father, based on the testimony of his stepmother, Caroline. An explosion disfigures him, but plastic surgery gives him an opportunity to return to England and investigate his father's murder under a new identity. As Robert Crockett he romances his stepmother, ultimately trapping her by creating the appearance of a double-cross among her accomplices, now guests at her house.
