Tomer Ve-Hasrutim

 This tough Israeli film concentrates on Tomer, a youth group leader in a small town near Tel Aviv who motivates a group of deliquent adolescent boys to create a play. The communal production goes through a number of shifts and changes, especially when the first writer departs abruptly to Canada. In a startling development soon afterwards, Tomer announces to the group that he is gay. For the straight boys in the gang, this is a shock; their process of adjustment forms a major thread in the play and the documentary. Directed by Tomer Heymann, this film has a rough-hewn vitality that matches the energy of the teenage boys.
