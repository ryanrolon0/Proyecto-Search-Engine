Rewind Rabbit

 Stanley, 40, has the mind of a child and lives in his cardboard house on the edge of the enchanted forest with his toy rabbit. You know, just like most people. A curious blend of stop motion animation and live video, Rewind Rabbit is a singularly unique vision, at once absurdest fairy tale, and a genuinely endearing portrait of an outsider who just happens to engineer his life from cardboard and cassette playback. It's a day in the life of someone far, far removed from yours.
