Saving Levi

 Set in rural China, Saving Levi is the story a severely burned infant left to die in the fields, but rescued by a farmer who dares to get involved - a great risk under communist rule. After doing all that he and his protesting wife are able to keep the child alive, the farmer - haunted by his compassion for the horribly injured baby while pondering about the circumstances of his abandonment - reluctantly embarks on a journey to save Levi's life and give him a better home.
