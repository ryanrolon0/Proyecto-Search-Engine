The Thieves, the Director, Her Actress & Their Studio Exec

 Two thugs kidnap a bondage movie director and when the director's star attempts a rescue, they rope and gag the blonde cutie as well. The red-haired studio executive decides to attempt another rescue rather than paying the ransom and she quickly falls into captivity, as well. In the second story line, a novelist tries to bring some verisimilitude to her heroine's plight and requests a friend tie her up. Unfortunately for the writer, the friend becomes a bondage enthusiast, tying the unfortunate women much tighter and longer than she bargained for.
