The Fighting Gringo

 Ben Wallace is after Don Aliso's rancho. After falsifying his land survey, he frames him for murder. But Wallace has a dull-witted accomplice in Rance Potter and this is who Wade Barton thinks he can trick into a confession. Wade Barton (George O'Brien) leads a band of riders who hire out to stagecoach companies or anybody else with trouble that needs honest settlement. He rescues Anita del Campo (Lupita Tovar) and a shipment of gold from a gang of bandits. Ben Wallace (William Royle), Rance Potter (Glenn Strange) and John Courtney (LeRoy Mason) have a scheme going to take his ranchero from Don Aliso del Campo (Lucio Villegas), and Barton and his riders take up the fight.
