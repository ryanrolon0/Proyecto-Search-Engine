Waiting at the Gate

 Robert, 16 years old, is two weeks from leaving school. Now, for the first time is his life, he has to make a serious decision about the future. And that's where things start to go wrong. While his friends have ideas, some extreme, about what they're going to do, Robert sparks an unconventional friendship with a brash, young teacher, who's as much of a lost soul as Robert, and this has an important affect on his life. This could be described as a coming-of-age story but Robert would say, "It's been done."
