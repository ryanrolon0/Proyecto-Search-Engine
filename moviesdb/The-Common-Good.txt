The Common Good

 The Documentary follows Jessie Nieblas and Marissa Valeri, two young women from the controversial group Catholics for Choice, as they travel across Wisconsin to share their message of how the use of Emergency Contraception can be reconciled with the Catholic Faith. Accompanied by a crew from Family Planning Health Services, a non-profit from Wisconsin that partnered with the two to get their message about, they talk about their beliefs with members of the media and each other. The group encounters news media afraid of controversy coming to the sleepy Midwest state as the documentary examines how a controversial idea, like Catholics using contraception, goes from just an idea to a part of the public sphere, as the group pokes the hornet nest that is the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and its extremely pro-life Bishop.
