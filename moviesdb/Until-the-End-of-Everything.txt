Until the End of Everything

 Set in exotic 1960s South America, the fate of gentleman super spy Ethan Hazard is put directly in the hands of the audience as the story pauses to allow them to vote and choose the path he takes. Should Hazard rough up the fez-wearing assassin? Charm him into joining his cause? Or maybe beguile him with a funny accent? Given the responsibility of the secret agent's fate, it quickly becomes apparent that the audience would rather satisfy it's own cruel desire for entertainment than help the hero. Ethan Hazard then finds himself in a battle to not only complete his mission but to endure the torment of his 'Gods.'
