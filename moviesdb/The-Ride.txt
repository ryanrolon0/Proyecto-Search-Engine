The Ride

 A documentary that revolves around the Professional Bull Riding (PBR) circuit, a tour that includes 45 of the world's top riders. The film is bookended with explosive competition footage brimming with hulking bulls, airborne riders, and high-wattage pyrotechnics. Sandwiched in the middle is a journey across the back roads of America that reveals the cast of characters, each with genuine wit and that unmistakable cowboy aura.
