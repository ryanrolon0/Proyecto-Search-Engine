Tito, el navegante

 A house in a slum, next to La Plata river, surrounded by iron sculptures and respectful, on its own architecture, of the changeable tide of the shore. This house is made of glass bottles (thousands and thousands of them, with different shapes and colors, among which the southern wind blows and the sun shines), and we could say that art has reached a new look. Tito Ingenieri (05/27/1954), sculptor and craftsman, is devoted to forge and glass. He has built this extraordinary home and welcomes us to absolutely look around and visit everywhere. He is willing to clear all doubts about it and to know a bit more about the struggle of a man that builds his path on the art way with his own hands.
