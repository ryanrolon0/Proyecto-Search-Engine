Untitled Violent Movie

 A philosophical hit man muses on his life and principles in voice-over narration as we watch him meet with one of his employers on pay day. He knows something's up, because the guy wants to talk to him outside. Waiting in the rat-infested alley are three thugs. Is our philosopher going to get paid? Which rats will get fed?
