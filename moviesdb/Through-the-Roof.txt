Through the Roof

 In January of 2010, the C.H.E.K Institute teamed up with the Challenged Athletes Foundation, Overstock.com and many other key sponsors to help assist the first female paraplegic athlete to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Africa. On Sunday, January 31st, 2010, at approximately 5 PM, Erica Davis, a paraplegic since 2005, along with Tara Butcher, an amputee below the left-knee, reached the summit. This successful project is designed to bring awareness to the capabilities of Challenged Athletes everywhere in that anyone can accomplish anything and everything they put their minds to. The preparation and climb were filmed by Captured Life Productions to be compiled into a documentary entitled Through the Roof.
