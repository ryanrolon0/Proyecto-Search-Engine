Vaudeville Days

 A narrator provides very brief info on the beginnings and history of Vaudeville, starting with the first off Broadway "straight variety" show in 1881 from which a musical number is recreated. Next, the growth in popularity of Vaudeville is displayed with several classic acts from Vaudeville's early decades being recreated by impersonators. Then, several contemporary (30's-40's) Vaudeville acts perform. And finally, a large contemporary musical stage production with a tropical island theme is performed.
