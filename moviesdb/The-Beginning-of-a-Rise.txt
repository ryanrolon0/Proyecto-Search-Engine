The Beginning of a Rise

 This is a story of a low level street gang nobody cares to know about - until one mission brands them apart when they strike out against those in the upper echelons of organized crime. Unbeknown to them, the Syndicates have already begun their plan of retaliation, demanding retribution. And before the neon lit night gives way to the dawn, jealousy will threaten to rend the bonds of friendship apart, the hierarchy is put at risk, and innocence is shattered. The final result is a private essay by a young man who loves to write as much as he loves to fight. No one else will tell their story-The beginning of a rise.
