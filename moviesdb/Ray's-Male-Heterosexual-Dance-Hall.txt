Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall

 In this short film, our unemployed hero finds that getting that great job depends a lot on whom you choose to dance with at Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall. Sam Logan is a young executive who's just lost his job, and is finding it impossible to make the connections necessary to be considered for a good opportunity. He runs into his acquaintance Cal, who tells him that all the best business connections are made at a small, little-known downtown club. Intrigued, Sam forgoes his scheduled job interview in order to accompany Cal to the club, which he finds to be a bit odd in its ritualized social activities; but he gamely plays along, hoping to get his big break.
