Unusual Occurrences

 A group of local ghost hunters are hired to complete a paranormal investigation of the abandoned Sonestown School that was closed down in 1968, shortly after a school teacher murdered a young boy and then committed suicide. After tragedy strikes the ghost hunters group, police later describe the events that were captured on video as 'Unusual Occurrences.'
