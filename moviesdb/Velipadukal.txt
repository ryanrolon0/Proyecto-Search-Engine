 This story of a religious dystopia happens in the future, when everybody follows Scientific Religion. People eat their dead relatives. All women are illiterate and spend their lifetime reproducing. The movie narrates how an adolescent comes out of the closet in such times to discover some nasty truths about humanity. This story of a religious dystopia takes place in the future, at a time when the entire world believes in Scientific Religion. The religion grants eternity to its followers - dead persons are cooked and eaten so that their molecules can pass to the subsequent generations. All women are illiterate and live in special rooms in which they spend their lifetimes reproducing (or, in their terminology, doing "non-oral molecule transfer") and listening to "The Book" and other dogma read out to them. In such times, a college student develops a hunch that things are not that well with his society. The doubts gradually progress to certainties, despite his attempts to suppress them and strengthen his faith by spending more time on religious activities. This leads to opposition from his family and the society, and eventually he is forced to live as an outcast. While some believers conspire to terminate him, he discovers some facts which prove that the basic tenets of Scientific Religion are wrong. As he announces his discovery with pride, the society, now devoid of the restraints of the religion, drifts to lawlessness and savage acts. At that moment it is revealed to him that the Scientific Religion was a ploy designed to prevent humankind from doing immoral acts by giving them a false promise of eternity.
