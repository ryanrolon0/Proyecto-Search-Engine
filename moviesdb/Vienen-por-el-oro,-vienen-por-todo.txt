Vienen por el oro, vienen por todo

 In Esquel, Argentinean Patagonia, a Canadian company was granted with the rights to extract gold and silver from a mine located 7 km. away from the city, using huge amounts of water and cyanide. With a 50% of the population living below the limits of poverty, the mining enterprise arises as the great solution for such dearth. 'They come for the gold, they come for it all' sheds light on the deep confrontation among the own residents of Esquel, who struggled between supporting the mining project or not. It's an epic story, where a little town beat huge economical and political powers.
