Protein Expressions

 In just 4 minutes a group of scientists (active in the fields of protein motion and visual representation of cell biology) will lead you to a journey to discover an entire new world activity at the surface, to the apparent calm of single molecules, we travel across the cytoplasm between pipe-like structures and networks of contractile cables. Proteins and other molecular structures are represented according to scientific data, and convey an idea of life at the nanoscopic level. While the movie can be enjoyed by all, this work represents a major scientific effort proteins modeled and animated at atomic level. Enjoy a new way of seeing the nanoscopic world of cell biology
