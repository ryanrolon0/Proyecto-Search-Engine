Sorority Girls and the Creature from Hell

 A group of sorority girls go up to a cabin in the woods accompanied by some boys. To their dismay, there is an escaped convict on the loose as well as the uncle of one of the girls. It's too bad that Uncle Ray is possessed by an Indian spirit turning him into a monster with a need for human blood.
