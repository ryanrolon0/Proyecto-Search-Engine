The Gauntlet

 In a sunken castle underneath the earth, six strangers wake. They have no food. No memory. No water. And no way out. These strangers are from every normal walk of life, yet they each have a secret. They don't know it yet, but they're capable of something they never imagined. They must organize and band together for the sinister adventure that awaits them.
