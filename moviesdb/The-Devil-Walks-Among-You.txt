The Devil Walks Among You

 Please join Lilith Mastema for her spoken word live show. Her voice will captivate you and her tales will seduce you. Her newest tale of the macabre is about a diner along a dark stretch of road that receives one final customer of the night. The Devil. And the remaining people inside the diner are in for one hell of a night. Lilith's story reminds us that even though we may not believe in the devil, that doesn't mean he isn't real.
