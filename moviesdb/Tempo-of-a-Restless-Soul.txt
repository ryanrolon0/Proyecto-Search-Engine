Public figure Tom Barman hardly needs introduction front man of rock band dEUS, musical factotum and the man behind the 0110 happening against ultra-right. However the extrovert artist - who enchants, seduces, affects and inspires - hardly ever bares his soul. Klaas Janszoon, Barman's longtime companion at dEUS, says believe that I get to know Tom more from his lyrics than from what he says to me."
