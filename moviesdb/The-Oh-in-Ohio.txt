The Oh in Ohio

 In Ohio, Priscilla Chase is the VP of a company that works bringing new business to Cleveland. She has been married for more than ten years with Jack Chase, the biology teacher from the local public school. Priscilla is successful in her career but is frigid and has never reached an orgasm, hurting her frustrated husband. When Priscilla decides to buy a vibrator, Jack is seduced by his teenage student Kristen Taylor and recovers his self-esteem, working out, losing weight and dressing adequately. Priscilla has new sexual experiences and becomes closer to Wayne the Pool Guy, the constructor of swimming pools in her neighborhood since she was a child. The new relationships upgrade the personal and professional lives of Priscilla and Jack. Priscilla Chase seems to have it all -- the perfect job, the perfect house, the perfect husband -- except for in bed, where sex has always left her a bit short of the finish line. Priscilla Chase (Pose) and her husband Jack (Rudd) have a problem having had sex three times a week each week for the 10 years of their marriage, she has never had an orgasm. That leaves her feeling incomplete and him feeling inadequate. He looks for his manhood in the arms of teenager, and she looks for her "O" with the help of a mechanical devise. Of course neither finds the answer they were looking for, and continue to search for meaning and fulfillment.
