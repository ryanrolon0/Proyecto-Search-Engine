Virtualities

 The relationship between image (as a representation of reality) and reality itself. The film is attempting to demonstrate the discrepancy between image and reality and address the deformations caused by the virtualization of reality and its spectacular narratives. By displaying images of contemporary world as it is demonstrated by advertising industry, "Virtualities" is struggling for a realistic representation of an objectified world.
