The Lost Village of Terminal Island

 A little known corner in the Port of Los Angeles was once home to nearly 3000 Japanese immigrants and their families. These pioneers of the fishing industry prospered for several decades until 1941, when World War II triggered the tragic end to their tight-knit village. The Lost Village of Terminal Island is the story of this unique place as told by its original inhabitants, the American-born nisei who spent their childhood there. From its formation nearly 100 years ago to the ongoing struggle to keep the community alive, these nisei will always consider Terminal Island their 'Furusato' - Home Sweet Home. Special Edition narrated by Rob Fukuzaki.
