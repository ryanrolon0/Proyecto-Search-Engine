The Phantom in the House

 An inventor takes the blame for a killing his wife committed and serves a long prison sentence. Upon his release he returns, he returns as a 'family friend,' hoping to get to know his now-grown daughter who thinks he is dead. His wife is doing rather well, thank you, from the proceeds of his inventions. but does not seem all that enthused about his return, plus there is an oil-can-harry, gold-digging-gigolo Marquis courting his daughter...and, then, another murder. Will Papa take the fall, this time?
