The Housing Problem

 A topical post-WWII cartoon dealing with the shortage of housing for the returning military people and their families. In this one, though, the family having a housing problem is a family of pigs. They trail moving vans and investigate "For Rent" signs, and even try to move the dogs out of their kennel. Finally, they buy a prefabricated house, have a very hard time putting it together and, then, termites show up and destroy their new home.
