The New Dude and a Market Woman

 A policeman is seen in the foreground, proudly walking to and fro, swinging his club. In the distance we see a dude coming down the street, and failing to see the officer, they collide. The copper proceeds to club the dude all around the street, and in the scuffle they overthrow the market woman, who, on regaining her feet, proceeds to beat both men with her basket. Her constant companion, a large St. Bernard dog, takes an occasional bite of the dude, much to his discomfiture, but to the amusement of the onlookers.
