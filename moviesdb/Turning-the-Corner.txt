Turning the Corner

 "Turning The Corner" focuses on a group of college students at turning points in their lives. Most are approaching graduation and the real world. One of the characters, Albert, is not close to graduation, but seeing his friends prepare for their futures forces him to consider his own. Albert must face more than the prospect of graduation--Albert is a quadriplegic. Albert attempts to leave behind his slacker nature as he pursues his place in the world. The journey is less than efficient, with humorous detours and lessons learned.
