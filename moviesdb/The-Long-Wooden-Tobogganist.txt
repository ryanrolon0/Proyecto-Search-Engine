The Long Wooden Tobogganist

 Sex, violence and wood, followed by hot chocolate. Such is a day in the life of this rare and beautiful creature, the Long Wooden Tobogganist. Never before captured on film, we witness majestic sliding, an epic fight for toboggan territory and the unique mating ritual of this rare icon of the Canadian Prairie.
