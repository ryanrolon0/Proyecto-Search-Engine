The Like Girl

 Epiphany Gluckman is stuck in her job because of her usage of the word "Like". Her jaded friend Marva tells her about the L.A.P.S.e. Institute, a treatment center to removed the "Like" word from her lexicon. Epiphany completes the disinformation when she loses her Goth Rock wardrobe, confronts her sexist boss, and starts her own dot com company.
