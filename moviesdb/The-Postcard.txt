The Postcard

 Stan, a married man, father of two suffers from depression and questions his sexuality. We find him in his garage making the final preparations for his suicide. He writes "Having a wonderful time. Wish you were here," on the back of a postcard. Blanche, his wife, picks their children up from school and returns home to find Stan on ground amid the exhaust from his truck reaching for the button to his broken garage door opener. Should she let nature take its course, or should she unlock the door and save him?
