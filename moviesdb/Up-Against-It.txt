 Marc Wallice is the successful star of bad action movies, who is being blackmailed to keep a hush on his days as a "blue movie" performer. Wallice and his action movie producer Jonathan Morgan attempt to turn the tables on the crooks. They've done this type of thing dozens of times in their movies, and Wallice always comes out on top. But real life intrigue proves to be more difficult.
