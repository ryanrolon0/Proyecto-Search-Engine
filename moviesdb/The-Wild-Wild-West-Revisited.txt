West and Gordon must stop him before President Cleveland is replaced, but the job won't be easy as the mad scientist has at his disposal a wide assortment of advanced weapons-ranging from robots to atomic bombs. The intrepid team of 19th century government underground intelligence agents made famous on the 1965-69 television series are brought out of retirement to discover whether clone-like imposters may have been substituted for the crowned heads of Britain, Spain, Russia and President Cleveland. It's 1885. Super agent James West and Artemus Gordon have been in retirement for years. But Villain extraordinare Miguelito Lovless has somehow replaced the crowned heads of England, Spain and Russia with exact duplicates under his control. And President Cleveland could well be next.
