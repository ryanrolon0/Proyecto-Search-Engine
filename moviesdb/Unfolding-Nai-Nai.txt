Unfolding Nai Nai

 A 30-minute experimental documentary about a 96 year-old Chinese grandmother and her experience as a mother and political emigre. A combination of video montage with long-distance phone interviews, this quasi-narrative short film poetically unravels intimate snippets of her life told through the perspectives of her children and American grandchild/filmmaker, Joyce Lee. Grandma demonstrates strong spirit and craftiness despite having bound feet and an adulterous husband.
