StillLeben - Geordnete Leidenschaften IV

 Nakedbodies, faceless, a catalog of their gestures. Three-thousand photographies inbetween standstill and movement. That what is not captured, does not exist; that what is captured, is dead. What isn't caught, does not exist; what has been caught is dead. The film is a succession of thousands of still lives. StillLiving is composed of three thousand photographs. Each photograph has been separately elaborated, and it is the film camera which enables the construction of new movement - sequences from stills. The movements of the bodies originate in the movement of the images - in their transition from one standstill/still life to the next. (Institut für Evidenzwissenschaft)
