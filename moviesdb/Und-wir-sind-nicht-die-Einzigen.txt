Und wir sind nicht die Einzigen

 In 2010 a scandal at the Odenwaldschule, arguably the most renowned boarding school in Germany, created a media storm. Not only were there the revelations that generations of children had been systematically abused for over three decades but it also became clear that when two former victims came forward in 1999 saying that 'they were not the only ones', their claims were ignored. This film tries to explore how this shocking case of abuse could happen in the first place and then how the revelations were swept under the carpet in a conspiracy of silence. Director Christoph Roehl interviews teachers and former pupils but most importantly gives voice to several victims who tell their story with rarely seen honesty and candidness.
