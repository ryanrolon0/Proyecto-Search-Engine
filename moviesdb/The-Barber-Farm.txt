The Barber Farm

 The Barber Farm has been part of my family for more than 50 years. But as my grandmother approached 90 years old, none of her children or grandchildren were interested in farming and the land lay fallow. The Barber Farm explores my family's struggles to decide whether to conserve the farm or sell it for development.
