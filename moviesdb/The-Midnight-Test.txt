The Midnight Test

 Four Amish boys form a "good Samaritan club" and look for opportunities to help their community. To admit new friends into their club, prospective members must pass The Midnight Test, a test designed to weed out school mates who do not seem to exhibit Christian character and behavior. The boys most decide if it is appropriate to test schoolmates' behavior and performance or simply a prideful way to form an exclusive club.
