Que mi nombre no se borre de la historia

 On August 5th 1939, after the Spanish Civil War ended with Franco's victory, thirteen young women, seven of them underage, were executed. It was one of the most abominable incidents of the postwar period. Depite attempts to erase them from history, they pass into legend, known as "the thirteen roses". They were all members of the JSU (Unified Socialist Youth), an antifascist organization. Relatives of the victims, JSU survivors and the General Secretary of the organization, Santiago Carrillo, tell us their own story.
