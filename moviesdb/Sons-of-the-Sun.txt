Sons of the Sun

 Three young men have formed a cult based on the book Sons of The Sun. Now they are planning their next move before global domination. They decide to go on a pilgrimage to visit the author Torstein Raaber, the god Gulgamesh's voice on earth. But the meeting won't be as expected and the cult must once again try to find their way in life.
