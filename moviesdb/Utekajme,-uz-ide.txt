 A comedy about happiness, Indian magic and adultery. One day Mr and Mrs Sysel happen to solve the problem of lacking enough room in their tiny flat. They break through the wall into their neighbour's comfortable flat, from which they borrow not only additional square feets of space, but things of his personal property as well.
