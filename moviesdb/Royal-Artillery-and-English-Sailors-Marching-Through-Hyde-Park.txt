Royal Artillery and English Sailors Marching Through Hyde Park

 This film is taken from the same point of view as the preceding subject ['The Funeral Cortege Arriving at Trinity Pier' (1901) (q.v.)], and shows a number of the guns of the Royal Horse Artillery passing on the way to Paddington. They are followed by file after file of our "Bluejackets," who go marching past the camera with the swing and precision for which they are noted. A very interesting view of the crowds lining both sides of the road is also obtained, also a view of a number of individuals, who, at imminent risk to themselves, having clambered up the trees growing by the roadside and turned them from the time being into veritable human "rookeries."
