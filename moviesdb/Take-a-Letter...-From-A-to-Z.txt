Take a Letter... From A to Z

 The joys of secretarial work as a career for young women are illustrated in this classroom training film. Secretaries (all women) are shown to be the ones who transcribe the ideas of their bosses (all men) into "perfect and permanent form" via the training they get from Gregg Shorthand Books (which just happen to be published by McGraw-Hill, the producers of this film). In addition, this film shows how a good secretary, in addition to her office duties, also knows how to take care of her boss' personal needs, such as getting him coffee and reminding him when to get a haircut. At the end of the film, as a little "bait," the boss is shown with a well-dressed young woman in a mink stole--obviously his wife--who just happened at one time to be his secretary. As the "wife" winks at the secretary, the narratr asks, "Will you be the one that every bright young career man of tomorrow hopes to find?"
