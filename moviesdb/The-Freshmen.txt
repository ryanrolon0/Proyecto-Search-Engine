The Freshmen

 "The Freshman" focuses on the homosexual activities surrounding a new freshman at a California campus. And it all happens in the first few days. Hanson is that freshman, but he doesn't seem to meet anyone until he shows up to pledge a frat. In between, the guys next door, dormies in the bathroom, and jocks in the locker room all have sex. Even his new roommate gets off alone one night before he makes that decision. It's a surprise revelation who also is there to pledge with him.
