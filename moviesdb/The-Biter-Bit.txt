The Biter Bit

 Two men work in a large garden, one of them watering with a hose and wearing a boater. A young man in apron and cap sneaks into the scene, hides behind a bush, and kinks the hose. The man in the boater can't figure out what's going on, and before too long, he's soaked. He gives chase. Will he catch the prankster, and if he does, what punishment will he meet out?
