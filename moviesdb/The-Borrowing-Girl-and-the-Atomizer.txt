The Borrowing Girl and the Atomizer

 The action takes place in front of a set constructed of canvas painted to resemble the boudoir of a young woman. The first scene begins with one young woman sitting on a bed while another is sitting at a table. The door opens and a third young woman enters. She borrows something in a bottle and walks out. The two young girls take a bottle from a dressing table, fill it with ink and replace it. The door opens and the other girl returns, picks up the bottle and sprays it on herself. The ink squirts in her face and scene ends as she leaves the set in anger.
