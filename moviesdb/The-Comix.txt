The Comix

 The well-regarded creator of a highly successful comic strip, "Little Annie Often," actually has little to do with the strip--his staff does all the work and he takes the credit (and the money). He also cheats on his wife and treats everyone else like dirt. One day the artist who actually draws the strip dies, and "Little Annie Often" comes to life, determined to prove to the world what a fraud the supposed "creator" is.
