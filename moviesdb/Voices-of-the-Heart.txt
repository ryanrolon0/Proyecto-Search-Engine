Voices of the Heart

 Can learning how to speak your ancestral language change a community, liberate a nation? Voices Of The Heart looks at the new Arapaho native immersion school on the remote, Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, through the eyes of Tish Keahna, a Native Meskwaki/Ojibwe mother. She returns to Wind River after thirty years to see how education and growing up on the reservation has changed.
