Scream Queen

 B-movie Scream Queen Dana Lewis is tired of playing the helpless victim in straight-to-video movies and dreams of becoming a serious actress. After getting her "big break" as the lead in an independent film, the Scream Queen is forced to work on location in the Mojave Desert where she gets more than she bargained for - an obsessed fan as the director and a cast and crew of local weirdos. Under contract, Dana is forced to act in the movie and face her secret fear that she has no talent.
