The Hot Dog Cycle

 Hot Dog is a man in a hot dog suit who believes he is a real live tasty foot long. His life hasn't gone exactly as planned and he finds himself perched perilously on the edge of a bridge, torn between his tortured life as a hot dog and the painless relief of shedding it all. Before he can take that step his life crosses paths with a beautiful stranger - Daisy. Her simple act of kindness inspires Hot Dog not to jump. In fact, he becomes eerily, and comedically, obsessed with her. Hoping to win Daisy's heart, Hot Dog follows her to a local public access cable station where he finds himself thrust into the spotlight of his own show. Hot Dog's obsession is driven to extremes as he unintentionally stalks his young love. Despite all his efforts, Hot Dog finds himself perched, once again, on the edge. Has he learned enough to choose life? Or will the limitations of his hot dog life be his ultimate demise?
