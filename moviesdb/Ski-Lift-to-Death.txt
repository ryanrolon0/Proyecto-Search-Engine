Ski Lift to Death

 A sports promoter tries to matchmake for a pair of ski champions and as a result, they end up trapped in a derailed ski-lift car, along with a gangster and the hitman sent to kill him. A sports promoter tries to matchmake for a pair of ski champions and as a result, they end up trapped in a derailed ski-lift car, along with a gangster and the hit-man sent to kill him . All of the above is a crock. The promoter is trying to get the female champ away from the male champ, for business and (his) pleasure. The other male champ is on a different gondola with his 17 yr old girlfriend. The gondola w/ the promoter, the female champ, the gangster and his girlfriend (who was actually working for the mob, but was in love w/ the gangster) was bashed against a cable tower, by a gust of wind. The male (main) champ is a member of the ski patrol & rescues them. The gangster was injured and is taken down the mountain, by a member of the ski patrol, on a rescue sled. The hit-man, who has skied to the accident sit and claimed to be a doctor, overtakes the patroller, tells her she is needed at the aid station and offers to transport the gangster. Fortunately, the Judas/girlfriend sees the killer leaving and alerts the hero, who saves the gangster and he can proceed to testify against his bosses. The hero/champ sends the female champ off on the circuit, to "do her thing", while he works on their love-nest. I SAW the damn thing. What did Mr. Beaver see?????? Mack. ssg6mack@eznet2u.net
