The Silver Bullet

 Wild Bill Jones is saved from three toughs by "Silver Jim" Donovan, a newcomer to Winchester. They team up to campaign for Thad Morgan for state senate running against crooked incumbent Walter Kincaid. Morgan's campaign is headed by saloon owner Queenie Canfield. Jim visits Doc Winslow and asks him to keep on the lookout for a man with a jagged scar on his left arm, as a man so-marked had shot Jim's father in the back with a silver bullet which Jim now wears as a watch fob, with full intentions of returning it to the former owner. Kincaid has Morgan killed, and Jim, Nancy Lee and others now campaign for Morgan's widow, Emily. Jim Donovan arrives looking for the man that shot him with a silver bullet and also killed his father. Jim can recognize him by the scar on his arm. Kincaid is that man and learning of Jim's quest, goes to the Doctor to have the scar removed. After the operation he kills the Doctor, but Jim had already informed the Doctor and underneath the bandages the scar still remains.
