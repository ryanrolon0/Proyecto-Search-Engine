The Christmas Orange

 Seven-year-old Holly Stingley gives Santa Claus a sixteen-page wish list. When she wakes up to a measly orange under the Christmas tree, she takes Santa to court! Holly hires the meanest lawyer in town, Wiley Studpustle, to help her sue Santa for breach of promise. The courtroom fiasco drives Santa to quit, and leads Holly to a mysterious discovery... and the true spirit of Christmas.
