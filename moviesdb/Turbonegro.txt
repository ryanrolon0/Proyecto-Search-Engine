Turbonegro

 "The Movie" compiles nearly one hundred minutes of Turbonegro video footage culled from various sources and "Get it on", several band features that were broadcasted by German Viva TV during 1997/98, live recordings from the Darkness Forever tour and the farewell show in Oslo, plus lots of obscure on-the-road snippets from Turbo's private archives that were all recorded in Norway, Germany, Spain and USA between 1995 and 1998 at various locations.
