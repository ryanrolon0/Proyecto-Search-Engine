Spreadin' the Jam

 A young woman who is unable to pay her rent gets some unexpected help when the other tenants throw a last-minute rent party in her apartment. In the process, they all charm the landlady out of a year's rent. The entire story is told in song (swing music) and dance (Jitterbug, Lindy Hop etc.).
