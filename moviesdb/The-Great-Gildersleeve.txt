The Great Gildersleeve

 Small-town eccentric Throckmorton Gildersleeve (of radio fame) has a few problems Margie and nephew Leroy; the judge's predatory sister Amelia has matrimony in mind. When a misunderstanding gives Amelia the idea she's all but engaged, the kids form a wild scheme to get Gildersleeve out of trouble; slapstick results.
