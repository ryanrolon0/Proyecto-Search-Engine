The Sierra

 The air ain't all that's cold in the Sierra Nevada, especially just outside of 19th Century Virginia City, Nevada. For this is where the lives of a Native American couple collide with a ruthless gang. They seek revenge upon two brothers who interrupted their train robbery and escaped with the cash. The head outlaw leads his men into the snowy wilderness to finish off the already-wounded duo. There they encounter a helpless Native Woman in the middle of a hard-to-get game with her husband on their wedding day. After fighting off an attempted rape, the terrified beauty takes a bullet to the chest from the second in command. Conveyed through the eyes of a Native ancestor that alludes a new beginning to a familiar story, The Sierra demonstrates how two completely different cultures can come together and share the strongest of commonalities -- in this case, a callous enemy and the loss of a loved one.
