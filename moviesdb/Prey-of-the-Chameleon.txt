Prey of the Chameleon

 J.D. returns to his small Texas hometown where four years ago he left Carrie at the altar. She's now a deputy sheriff, and she's not happy to see him. He soon has a job offer in Bakersfield, so he's off to California with Carrie telling him not to come back. Late that night he stops to help a woman whose car has broken down, and soon he's both her protector and her lover, little realizing she's an escaped mental patient - a serial killer who adopts the name, dress, gestures, and mannerisms of her latest victim. As they head toward California, she leaves a trail of bodies. The FBI, with help from Carrie, is on the tail of the lovers. But is J.D. her next prey?
