The Gifted

 "The Gifted," based on Ian Parker's New Yorker article "The Gift," about the life of controversial philanthropist Zell Kravinsky. He made millions in real estate and over the past six years he has given it all-nearly 45 million dollars of assets-away. He kept for himself only a modest house. But this was not enough. In 2003 he donated his kidney to a stranger who needed it.
