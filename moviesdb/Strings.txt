 In the wake of his daughter's death, a troubled musician seeks out an experimental therapist to turn his life around. When the therapist calls for him to leave everything behind and take on a new identity, the musician realizes his new life isn't what it seems and his therapist is using patients to commit vigilante crimes. After eight years as a criminal, he sneaks back to visit the life he left behind.
