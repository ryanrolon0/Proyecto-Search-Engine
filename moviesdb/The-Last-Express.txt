The Last Express

 The year is 1914. Robert Cath, an American Doctor, becomes a fugitive from the law while in Ireland for a murder he did not commit. He flees to Paris, France, and at the invitation of an old friend, Tyler Whitney, arranges to board the famous Orient Express just days before World War I breaks out. Arriving late, boarding the train by jumping from a speeding motorcycle, he discovers Tyler brutally murdered in his compartment. As no one on board knows either of them, Cath assumes Tyler's identity and sets out to find the killer. What he discovers is that everyone on board has secrets that plunge him into a maelstrom of Treachery, Romance, and International Intrigue.
