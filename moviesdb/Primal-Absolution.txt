Primal Absolution

 Taking a summer break from visual arts..An experimental short film about a troubled individual. PRIMAL ABSOLUTION is about looking through ones self and not being afraid of experiencing the other side. It's a surreal/abstract insight into a dark world where you find terrible thoughts, mortality, fantasies of abuse and an indulgent love affair. Cassandra Dion reports on her inhibitions, dreams and (reality) where she wishes and dreams for a cloudy sky. Done more as an art film...it's about creating a personal cinema of fears and desires.
