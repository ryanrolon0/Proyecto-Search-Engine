Transient

 Abigail discovers an envelope in her mailbox, and upon opening it she finds a handwritten letter from Henry, a man she has known and loved for most of her life. In the letter, Henry simply writes Finding this letter sets off a series of events that leads Abigail's husband, Johnny, to find a shoe box filled to the brim with letters all addressed to Abigail, all from different men. Immediately, Johnny questions Abigail about the letters, and what they all mean. Through the letters, Abigail takes Johnny through the mind and travels of Henry, and piece by piece they begin to put together the jigsaw puzzle journey that lead them here in the first place. In this journey, the letters chronicle Henry's experiences as Taylor, a fencer working on a ranch struggling through financial woes, as Peter, an Iraq War veteran dealing with night terrors, and several of the other characters he becomes during the years he spends helping others while trying to find himself.
