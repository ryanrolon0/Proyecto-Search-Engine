The Adventures of the Crimson Angel

 Superheroine bondage film with four story lines. In the first, the Crimson Angel attempts to break up a white slavery ring and rescue two lovely victims only to be chloroformed and captured herself. In the second tale, the Crimson Angel is hot on the trail of a gang of diamond thieves. She manages to capture most of the thugs before being surprising, chloroformed and bound to a chair with a time bomb set to explode beneath her seat. In the third yarn, the Crimson Avenger infiltrates a gang of terrorists, but is surprised and captured. The bad guys spreadeagle her naked upon a table and aim a laser at her nether regions, which is designed to slowly increase in intensity and drive into a deadly orgasm. How can the super-heroine possibly escape this deadly trap if her body doesn't want to? In the last tale, a demented fan catches the buxom super-heroine off guard with his sugary compliments then chloroforms her when she drops her guard. What evil fate awaits our helpless heroine?
