The Hunger Artist

 A victim of a consumer obsessed society, indifferent to people's individual suffering; the Hunger Artists struggle becomes a statement about our society. Starving himself for the amusement of others until near death the Hunger Artist never had to think about his predicament too much. In a bizarre attempt to extort money from the Hunger Artists owner, 2 thieves kidnap him for a ransom. Nothing is paid and the thieves 'throw him away'. Lost and confused he becomes a source classic Freudian reflection and projection. Everyone he meets take a little something from him and cuts him loose again. Eventually the Hunger Artist is found dying by a group of new century clubbers who comfort and protect him like a messiah during his last moments, and are left empty with his passing.
