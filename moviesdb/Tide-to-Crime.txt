Tide to Crime

 Out on parole, recovering drug-addict Victor Rhodes needs work. His former cell-mate, Marvin, informs him of the "sweet" setup he currently has honest work on a ship, where the meals and rent are free, and labor is undemanding. Victor joins Marvin as a deckhand, but the conditions aren't all they were made out to be. To make matters worse, a crew member has suddenly disappeared (which causes both Victor and Marvin to suspect a surly deckhand, named Hacker), and mysterious noises echo from deep within the hull. Victor must discover the reason for the crew's secretive nature, overcome his addiction, and distance himself from any illegal activity, or be forever tied to a life of crime.
