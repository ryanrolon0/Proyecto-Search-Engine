This Is Twin

 See a city through the eyes of a faceless artist as he wrestles with what it means to be a part of the fabric of a city. Follow him as he paints architectural features onto the bland walls of the city while wrestling with what it means to create true beauty and how to leave a legacy his daughters can be proud of.
