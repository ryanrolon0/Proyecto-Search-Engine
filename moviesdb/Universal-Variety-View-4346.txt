 This short tell the success story of the 'Leslie Bell (III)' (qv) Singers from Ontario, Canada. The choir appeared on many radio and television stations, both in the U.S. and Canada. Under the tutelage of choir-director Dr. Leslie Bell, the choir voices match professionals in tone, color and blending, although all the members are stenographers and clerks who have their regular jobs to go to every morning, and sing for the pure pleasure of it. The short shows the choir working hard at rehearsal in preparation for an upcoming performance at NYC's Madison Square Garden.
