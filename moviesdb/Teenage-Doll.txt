Teenage Doll

 The Black Widows, a teenage girl gang, find one of their number killed; they suspect Barbara, sometime girlfriend of the leader of rival gang The Vandals. As the gangs prepare for a rumble, we glimpse the members' home lives, exaggerating every type of family dysfunction; but that of their "average American" quarry is no better. Full of shadowy urban night scenes. Barbara Bonney, a non-member, accidentally stabs a member of 'The Black Widows' gang to death over the attentions of Eddie Rand, leaders of 'The Vandals." Five of 'The Black Widows", led by Helen, track Barbara to her home intent on killing her in revenge. She escapes and makes her way to 'The Vandals" hideout on the city dump grounds, where she finds Eddie and his group engaged in a bit of 1950s' debauchery with their female counterpart, "The Vandalettes.' 'The Vandals' and 'The Vandalettes' prepare for a gang war just as soon as 'The Black Widows' show up with their male counterparts 'The Tarantulas.'
