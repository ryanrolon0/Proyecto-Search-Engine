Shattered Day

 A bank robbery is about to take place. We follow everyone involved in the robbery, the bank manager, the security guard, the robbers, the tellers, up to the moment when guns start blazing on the botched attempt. In the flurry of bullets we suddenly flash back and follow each of their twisted lives - everyone is jaded by greed and willing to betray their friends and lovers to keep from getting caught. In this fast paced action thriller we find every moment counts and nothing is what it seems on what will be a Shattered Day.
