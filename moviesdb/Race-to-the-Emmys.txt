Race to the Emmys

 Mary Lynn Rajskub, from the hit TV show "24", brings her unique style of comedy to conduct "person on the street" interviews with TV fans. With a love of television, and in the spirit of Jay Leno's "Jaywalking," Mary Lynn chatted with the public about what shows and stars should win Emmys this year - and why. Her host segments anchored the piece along with footage of past Emmy show moments, creating the Emmy statuettes, and a back stage preview of this year's telecast. The video was viewed by over 1.4 million people on United Airlines as part of their in-flight entertainment.
