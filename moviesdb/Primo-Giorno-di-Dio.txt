Primo Giorno di Dio

 In one of Rome's catholic schools the year is 2008, in a Jewish classroom it is 5768, and for Muslim students who take religious instruction at the Mosque it is 1428. Director Gualtiero Peirce filmed the first contact with religious teaching of all three groups of children, whose joyful spontaneity made the key concepts of all their faiths - the devil, respect for others, heaven and the creation of the earth - seem very much alike. The little stars of the film, first and foremost children, regardless of their beliefs, make a strong case for a future of dialogue and coexistence.
