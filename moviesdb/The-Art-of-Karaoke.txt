The Art of Karaoke

 In the twilight of his life, Art Himmel discovered he had a gift for song. Now this WWII veteran and cancer patient sings karaoke three nights a week at little bars around the city. He does it for health, he does it happiness. In this youth-obsessed world, Art is living singing proof that you're never too old to be as young as you feel.
