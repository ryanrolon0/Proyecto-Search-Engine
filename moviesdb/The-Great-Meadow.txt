The Great Meadow

 In a little Virginia village in 1777, Daniel Boone comes and talks about Kentucky. He describes it as the promised land, with ample game and lush fields. Due to this speech, a group of villagers, including Berk and his new wife Diony, decide to trek the 500 miles to Kentucky. However, the dream soon fades to reality as they endure Indians, hunger, death and bad weather. After six months they finally stagger into the fort. Most of the settlers build homes and plant fields outside the fort, and the Indians, led by Black Fox, are out to kill them.
