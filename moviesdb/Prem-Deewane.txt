Prem Deewane

 Radha (Pooja Bhatt) and Manohar (Vivek Mushran) love each other and want to get married, but Radha's dad (Ashok Saraf) does not approve of their marriage as Manohar comes from a poor family. He instructs Radha not to leave the house, but Radha finds a way to escape and goes to Manohar's house. Anticipating more obstacles, they run away, guided by Radha's uncle Natwarlal(Prem Chopra). Natwarlal convinces them that they must kidnap a wealthy person and demand a big ransom and take the money to appease Radha's dad. It is then they start to realize that their uncle has some other devious plans for them.
