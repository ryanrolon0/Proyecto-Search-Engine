Scenes of Horror 3

 A pov black and white journey into another dimension by an urban creek. The walker tries to enjoy the running waters and bird songs, only to be interrupted by disembodied laughter and mysterious sounds coming from all directions. A no-budget art/horror film with no dialog that is entertaining for all ages, appropriate for gallery shows or narrative screenings.
