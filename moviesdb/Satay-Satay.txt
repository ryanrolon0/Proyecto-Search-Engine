Satay Satay

 It is school holidays and the children are out playing in the Malaysian kampung. The bad tempered boy, Ah Sen, is spending the day with the elderly, Ah Gong, who is cutting down coconuts to try and please his grandson. Ah Sen is sick of coconuts, however, and things take a turn for the worst as his nagging leads Ah Gong to walk into an accident. Ah Sen's world is turned upside down, forcing him to consider losing a loved one he never appreciated.
