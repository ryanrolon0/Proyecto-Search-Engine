Smoky Mountain Wilderness Adventure

 Dolly's cousin Clovis has invented a brand new all terrain vehicle with you in mind. His wild and wacky tour of the Smokies is like no other, especially when he drafts Dolly to be his tour guide. But, no one is more surprised than Dolly to discover that she is also his co-pilot! Ride along with these two as you conquer land, air and water-not to mention a really big bear-as well as a train and one really steep waterfall. It's one hilarious adventure after another, but the breathtaking views of the Smokies and the surrounding countryside make for a trip that you won't soon forget.
