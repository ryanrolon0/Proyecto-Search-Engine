The Edifice

 Through a rich audio sound-scape and mise-en-scene of urban and natural environments, THE EDIFICE reveals the mysterious road-trip of a young man and woman set out to find a plot of land. In an ambience of sacred/profane tension, non linear narrative embraces magical realism as a mythic contemplation of the human condition.
