The School Trip

 While the bumbling, nature loving Mr George and a group of eager young students head of to the bird colony lookout, the less enthusiastic members of the class are left to keep up as best they can, under the supervision of the ever cable Miss Kentigan. A no-nonsense disciplinarian of Northern decent, she herds the group along till Jane's plans for a hit and run photo shoot drive her to distraction and the ever mischievous Kelly, Jenny and Sarah get ideas of their own. Join them all in this light-hearted romp through the gorgeous New Zealand bush, with the beautiful Waitakere Ranges as a back drop.
