Six Degrees of High Plains Drifter

 Six Degrees of High Plains Drifter is a short fiction interpretation of a mash up of the well-known films, Six Degrees of Separation (1993, directed by Fred Schepisi) and High Plains Drifter (1973, directed by Clint Eastwood). Elements of the eponymous films are loosely strung together in the few slow-moving, minimalist scenes in this film. The movie moves at the pace of old people in the desert.
