Septien

 Eighteen years after disappearing without a trace, Cornelius Rawlings (The Athlete) returns to his family's farm. While his parents are long deceased, Cornelius's brothers Ezra (The Matriarch) and Amos (The Artist) continue to live in isolation on this old, forgotten land. Wilbur, their farmhand, sleeps in a tractor tire out back. One day, the toilet breaks. A plumber is called. That man, Red 'Rooster' Rippington, shares his bed with a pretty, vaguely underage girl named Savannah. He also turns out to be a figure from Cornelius and Amos's past. It will take the efforts of a mysterious drifter, Jackson, to smother the Rawlings Brothers' demons once and for all.
