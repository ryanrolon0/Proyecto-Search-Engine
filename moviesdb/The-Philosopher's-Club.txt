The Philosopher's Club

 The Philosopher's Club investigates the views and motives of three different individuals. Sam Moussavi, Justin Kersey and Nikos Liddy star as conflicted young philosophers, sometimes good sometimes bad, trying to find some meaning to life. From religious debates to social gripes, The Philosopher's Club provides an abstract take on critical thinking.
