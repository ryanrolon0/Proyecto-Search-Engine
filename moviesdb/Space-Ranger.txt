Space Ranger waits patiently with his crew - Doug (The Robot) & Rocco (The Mechanic) - for a certain part to be invented so that their Space Vessel will be operational. The only man that has access to the part, so that this team of misfits can get back home, is arch nemesis, Racer. Fact or Fiction? Find out when TV personality, but now defunct Ted Bruce follows this supposed Space Ranger around with cameras at the ready. Get Ready, Get Set, Get Lost On Earth...
