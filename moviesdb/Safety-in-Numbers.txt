Safety in Numbers

 William Butler Reynolds is slated to inherit ten-million dollars on his 21st birthday, but his worldly uncle, F. Carstairs Reynolds, thinks the lad could use a bit of seasoning before that happens. He sends him to New York City with the purpose of the trip to acquaint him with the pitfalls and wicked ways of the big city, especially for young millionaires. The uncle, who believes there is safety in numbers, also assigns, and pays well, three Follies girls,Jacqueline, Maxine and Pauline, to oversee the lad's tutoring. In the interest of ensuring the boy is well-tutored, Alma McGRegor and Cleo Carewe volunteer their services. Nothing could possibly go wrong with that many experienced tutors on the job.
