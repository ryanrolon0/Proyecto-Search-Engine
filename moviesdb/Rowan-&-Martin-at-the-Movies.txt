Rowan & Martin at the Movies

 This public service short for U.S. Savings Bonds starts out with Rowan and Martin arriving at a TV studio, ostensibly to host a show. It turns out that trumpet player 'Herb Alpert' (qv) is the only other performer listed in the credits who is actually there in person. The others appear in clips, some from their own U.S. Savings Bonds spots, others from unidentified movie or TV appearances. Singer 'Barbara McNair' (qv) is shown entertaining U.S. troops in Viet Nam, and the youth group 'The Young Americans' (qv) also sings.
