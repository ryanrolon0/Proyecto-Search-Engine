Publicly Defended

 The year is 1985, Eddie Joe Lloyd is led out of a Wayne County courtroom in shackles sentenced to life in prison for the rape and murder of 16 year old Michelle Jackson. Mr. Lloyd did not commit the crime though. The only crime he was guilty of was being unable to afford adequate defense and being assigned an underpaid and overworked public defender. Publicly Defended takes one to the heart of the matter. From the people who protect the innocent to those trying to create change this film compels every Michigan resident to demand reform. It is a chilling and heart breaking look at what happens when money and politics in the Michigan justice system become more important than the lives it seeks to protect.
