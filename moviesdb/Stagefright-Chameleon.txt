Stagefright Chameleon

 A solitary figure in a bandanna walks across a railroad bridge on the edge of a city. Someone watches from a structure overhead; he hastens down stairs and chases bandanna man, cornering him, then handing him a card saying, "Don't give up hope." Bandanna man retaliates with a video camera, filming Mr. Hope. Is this a confrontation or a lark between friends? In the distance they see a woman and follow her into what seems to be, from the outside, a small building, but once inside they're in halls and tunnels that take them to the lair of the Mole King. Strange things happen there. Is there release to the open air? Can people connect? Is hope alive, or do isolation and despair rule?
