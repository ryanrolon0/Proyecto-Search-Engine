The Tango Dancer

 In "The Tango Dancer," Johnny Alonso (Joey D) of the WB's "One Tree Hill" plays the lead character, Sabatino Gardel, who is terrorized by a psychotic phone caller at 4 recollection of ever meeting it. One of the most disturbing and beautifully filmed thrillers of our time with a breakout performance from Irv Becker, an actor surely to look for. The Tango Dancer also stars the great Argentina tango dancers Angel Garcia Clemente and Ponti Del Mercado. "A film of questionable taste, but I loved it." Robert Duvall - actor, director
