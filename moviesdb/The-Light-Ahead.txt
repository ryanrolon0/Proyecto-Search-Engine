The Light Ahead

 Impoverished and disabled lovers Fishke nd Hodel dream of life in the big city of Odessa, free from the poverty and stifling old-world prejudices of the shtetl. Made on the eve of World War II, The Light Ahead is at once romantic, expressionist, and painfully conscious of the danger about to engulf European Jews. One of four Yiddish features directed by Edgar Ulmer.
