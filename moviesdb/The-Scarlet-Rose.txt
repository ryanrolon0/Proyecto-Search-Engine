The Scarlet Rose

 While watching an old World War II era movie about a beautiful damsel-in-distress, Natasha decides to try to reenact one of the scenes where the plucky heroine must escape from the ropes that hold her prisoner. Sammi, Natasha's roommate enters the living room unexpectedly, spies Natasha bound in a similar manner to the movie heroine and joins in the role-playing. The pair then imitate all of the tight bondage sequences that are depicted in the old black and white film.
