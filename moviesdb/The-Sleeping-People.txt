The Sleeping People

 One ordinary morning, Judith discovers a sleeping man in her front garden, next to the paper. After consultation with her co-workers, she decides to bring him inside. Before long, she's being pestered by town busybodies, and even the military - and her house plants aren't behaving the way they used to. An absurdist romance; a science-fiction fairy tale about love's limits, and its transformations.
