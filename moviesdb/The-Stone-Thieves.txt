The Stone Thieves

 Shot in Tuscany on a farm from the 1500's, about an Italian man who decides he must take back the land of his ancestors from the invading foreigners. With the help of his donkeys, a toad and some wild boar, the stone thief removes a wall from his neighbor's land, while his niece befriends the American children. When the American discovers that his stones are missing, he is furious. He reports it to the local policeman who claims it's an impossible case to prove. Meanwhile, the Italian girl teaches the American children her language and takes them to a magical spring. She takes them to meet her uncle in a deserted mining town. When the stone thief sees the girls together, he recognizes the friendship they've forged, and his feelings shift and he recants his desire to steal all the stones back from the foreigners.
