The Blazing Forest

 Kelly Hansen, the tough boss of a timber crew clearing property owned by Jessie Crain and her niece, Sharon Wilks, is, unknown to anybody else, working to pay back money stolen by his brother, Joe Roberts, who has a changed name, and no love for his brother. Just as the debt is about paid-off, Joe is killed in a truck accident, which starts a blazing forest fire. Jessie Crain's niece, Sharon, wants to escape from the ranch in Nevada to life in the city. To earn money for this move, Jessie decides to sell the timber on 200 acres of her land and she hires rough-tough Kelly Hansen to oversee the work. Kelly soon falls for Sharon but she's wooed by one of the timberjacks who seems to bear Kelly a grudge.
