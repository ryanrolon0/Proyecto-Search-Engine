The Swimming Man

 A short film abut dignity, forgiveness and acceptance. An old Man, Tam, goes about his daily ritual, clearing his lungs in the steam of the kettle before making his way across Liverpool's docklands to swim in the marine lake. As he enters the water, memories from his past wash up moments from his youth in depression era Glasgow, where Tam, known locally as the Swimming Man, is paid a few shillings to recover suicides from the Clyde. A beautifully shot, spare film, with a stunning central performance from Maurice Roeves. Inspired by the writer Esther Wilson's grandfather, who relocated to Liverpool from Glasgow, and took his memories with him.
