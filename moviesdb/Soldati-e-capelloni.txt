Soldati e capelloni

 An Italian music promoter has engaged an English rock band who wear their hair short and since it is the sixties people don't like them. The band and the promoter wait for the hair to grow but in the meantime the lads are called for military service and have their hair cut again. They decide to call themselves I Galeotti (the convicts).
