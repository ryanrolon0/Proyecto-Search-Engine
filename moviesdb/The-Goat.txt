The Goat

 Peter Morgan has it all. He's earned it. The home. The job. The wife. So it shouldn't bother him that his new assistant Dennis bested him in a poster drawing contest back in the fourth grade. That is, it shouldn't bother him. But it does. Oh, how it does. Especially since Dennis cheated. Slated for the promotion he's been after, Peter's about to get it -- if he just stays on track, if he can stop short of all out obsession over getting Dennis to admit that he really cheated thirty years ago. Can Peter keep his obsession under control? Will Dennis come clean? Watch the hilarious short film The Goat and find out!
