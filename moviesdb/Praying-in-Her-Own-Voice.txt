Praying in Her Own Voice

 This powerful film documents the courageous struggle of a religious female's group called Women of the Wall movement for equality next to the wailing wall, perhaps the holiest place on earth for Jews. The story of the Women of the Wall is a test case for the deprived status of women in Israeli public life. The film is an outcry protesting religious coercion and the violent silencing of women. It's a film that raises many questions about the battle of the sexes within the religious Jewish world.
