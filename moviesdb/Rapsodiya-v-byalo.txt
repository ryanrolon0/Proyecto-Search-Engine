Rapsodiya v byalo

 This is a story about a woman, but not completely a woman, because she is funny and plump, because she is a comedienne and being a female comedienne is very difficult work. During the whole time, the comedienne gets in the way of the woman and the woman # in the way of the comedienne. In fact, nothing in the life of this woman is 'completely'. She is an actress, but not completely. She is playing the role of her life, but not completely. In the end she dies, but not completely.
