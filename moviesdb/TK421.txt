TK421

 A rebel pilot, call sign Rogue Leader, is in the Mos Eisley Cantina and is surprised to learn that TIE pilot TK421 who is there to give him a parking ticket, is really an attractive female whom he now tries to get a date with. After numerous interruptions from various bar patrons, Rogue Leader is doing well, until the arrival of Darth Vader, the nefarious Sith Lord, who is also stalking TK421 trying to get a date with her as well. May the force be with them both.
