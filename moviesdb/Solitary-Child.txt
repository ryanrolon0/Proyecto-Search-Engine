Solitary Child

 Ricky, a high school baseball star on his way to the major leagues, looses his chance at glory when he gets into a drunk driving accident only weeks before his graduation. Unable to cope with the guilt of maiming and almost killing his girlfriend, he hastily leaves New Jersey for Boston to start a new life, never looking back, until he's forced to run home to save himself from a group of small time hit men. Ricky discovers it's not always possible to go home when he arrives to more problems than he had when he left and a lot of open wounds he can only try to mend.
