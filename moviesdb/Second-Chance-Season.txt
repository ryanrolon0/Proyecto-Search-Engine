Second Chance Season

 Second Chance Season explores the long-term, residual effects a senseless killing can have on a single family. This compelling documentary recounts one family's desperate attempt to triumph over tragedy by placing all of its hopes in the basketball aspirations of its youngest son. The centerpiece of the story is 17-year-old Nick, a two-time high school dropout who is given an eleventh hour reprieve by the school board and allowed to comeback for his senior year. Following the murder of his brother, Nick struggles to keep his family together, but his hoop dreams become a nearly unbearable burden as he realizes that only by succeeding both on and off the court will his family focus on the future and stop dwelling on its tragic past.
