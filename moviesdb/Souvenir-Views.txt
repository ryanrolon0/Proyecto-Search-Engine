 Marc Larre Miranda, a young man influenced by the Situationist Movement, travels from Barcelona to New York in order to experience a self-imposed "rite of passage" journey. Marc's family and best friend back home are only half aware of his challenge with survival and while the New York streets are filled with the exploitation of the tragic 9/11 event, Marc has turned to art; creating matchbooks with the cutout of the New York Skyline in homage to the city he has come to love.
