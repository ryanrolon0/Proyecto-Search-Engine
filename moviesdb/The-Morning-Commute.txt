The Morning Commute

 A man leave his house first thing in the morning and hails what one believes will be a taxi. But instead of a taxi, what arrives is a 2 meter diameter steel hoop, which he uses to travel through the street of Montreal by rolling inside the hoop. He is on the most part solitary in his travels, but makes the occasional stop along the way to do some acrobatic maneuvers with the hoop.
