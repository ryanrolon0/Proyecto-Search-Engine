Voices Between the Mountains-Coming of Age in the Siskiyous

 Voices is a film about Siskiyou Counties past and present as seen by Siskiyou youth filmmakers. The film highlights the rich cultural history of the Siskiyous and the challenges that youth face growing up in rural California. Voices shows us that California is not all beaches and malls. Karuk youth from Happy Camp, cowgirls from the town of Gazelle and rockers and environmentalists from Mt Shasta share with us in this film the cultural diversity, forgotten history and natural splendor of this tucked away region of California.
