The Air Mail Story

 This documentary charts the history of transporting mail by air, featuring much archival footage and pictures of rare stamps and covers. After early attempts to send mail via balloon, dirigible, and carrier pigeon, the air mail industry boomed after World War I. The early air mail pilots contended with primitive and dangerous equipment. After World War II, modern planes such as the DC-3, and later jets, took over. By the 1970s, "air mail" as such disappeared in the United States, as virtually all first-class mail now goes by air.
