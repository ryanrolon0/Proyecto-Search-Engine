Twine

 Francis Johnson was shaped by the Depression, when law prohibited postal workers from discarding twine on packages. A collector, Francis began saving and wrapping twine from hay bales onto a ball that grew to be 40 feet. Shortly after Francis began, Frank Stoeber, a Kansas farmer, got into the competition. Over the next 26 years their balls grew. Only one of them would emerge as the 'World's Largest Ball Of Twine'. Then, a Texas rancher, with ingenuity and capital, beat out both balls in less than a year, using a machine and plastic twine. For the two rural towns and thousands of visitors, it wasn't just about who 'won'. It was about what the balls came to represent -- values of commitment, community and conservation.
