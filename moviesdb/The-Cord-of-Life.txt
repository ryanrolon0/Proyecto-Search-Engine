The Cord of Life

 After being refused a loan by a friend, an angry Antonine vows revenge. Finding his friend's child at home alone, he ties the child to a rope suspended precariously over a five-story drop. Then he follows his friend and tries to stab him. When caught, he boasts about the child in danger, giving the father enough time to rush home and affect a rescue.
