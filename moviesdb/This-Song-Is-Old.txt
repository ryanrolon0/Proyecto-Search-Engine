This Song Is Old

 When octogenarian Chicagoan Sam Pfeffer heard about the Bnei Menashe, a people who claim descent from a lost tribe of Israel and practice the Jewish faith, he decided to obtain a Torah and deliver it to them in remote north-eastern India. So began a personal odyssey across half a world of geography and 3000 years of history. This Song Is Old follows Sam Pfeffer as he goes beyond forensic science and contemporary political intrigue to the heart of belief and belonging and fights to help the Bnei Menashe come 'home' to Israel.
