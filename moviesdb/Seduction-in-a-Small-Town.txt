Seduction in a Small Town

 Paul Jenks and his wife Sarah left California with their lovely son David and dumb daughter Ivy and started a farm in his native small town. Sarah is a short-tempered vegetarian, who doesn't really fit in the agricultural community. Sandy Barlow, a drifting accountant with shaky finances, envies their family happiness, worms her way in -as she does all over town-, fails to impress him with her female charms but pretends her aunt has the same hart disease as Sarah and asks the couple to spring her the money for an operation. When they answer they don't even have that much, everything is mortgaged, she swears revenge and takes it out on the whole family. Kristen Hadley, who didn't even finish her training in Social Services, buys the story Sandy gets five locals women to co-sign about child-abuse by Sarah, so the sheriff is send to take both young children away, and not just once for a day with Paul's parents... Little House on the Prairie star Melissa Gilbert plays Sarah Jenks, a small town mom falsely accused of abusing her children. Without any hard evidence, Sarah's children are taken from her and placed into foster care. She and her husband are forced to prove their innocence - not just to the government agencies, but also to the townspeople who are only too willing to believe the worst.
