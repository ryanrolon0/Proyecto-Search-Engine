The Monday Night Miracle

 In front of a sellout stadium with over 78,000 fans in attendance the New York Jets were getting hammered 30-7 with only 12 seconds left in the third quarter. New York Jet Vinny Testaverde had three INT's, Curtis Martin was also held in check, and the Jet defense could not stop the Dolphins. The once packed Meadowlands was almost empty as fans headed toward the gates with a glazed look upon their faces. Then it happened. The Jets stormed back from a 23 point deficit late in one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history.
