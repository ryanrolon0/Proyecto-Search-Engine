Property of Michael S. Fritchen

 On New Years Eve 2007, Michael S. Fritchen makes five resolutions in hopes of changing his life. In Matt Eastin's debut film, Fritchen chronicles the struggles of loneliness, ethical morality, personality disorder, and the cyclic fallibilities of his own making as he straddles the divide between childhood and adulthood. Searching for love, a career, and ultimately happiness, Fritchen offers an evocative glimpse into the isolated world of an adult who never quite came of age. His surprising account demonstrates the ability of Michael S. Fritchen to be one of the most honest, dishonest, funny, and disgusting individuals you will ever encounter.
