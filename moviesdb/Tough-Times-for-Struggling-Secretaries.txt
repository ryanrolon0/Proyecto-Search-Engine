Tough Times for Struggling Secretaries

 Five vignettes of secretaries and businesswomen who are captured, bound and gagged. In the first story, a secretary who quit who her job after being roped, muzzled and robbed at work is victimized by the same criminal at her new job. In other stories, a wealthy employer's faithful assistant can't warn her boss about the vixen taken him for a ride because she's a trussed up captive; a sacked employee gets her revenge by hogtying the supervisor who fired her; a teleworker has a daydream about being spreadeagled on her bed and fondled by her imaginary captor and finally a sexy secretary angrily tries to free herself from the cords that bind her and the duct tape that silences her when no one comes to her rescue.
