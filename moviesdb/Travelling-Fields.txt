Travelling Fields

 Travelling Fields focuses on a particular phenomenon occurring through a change of perspective and animated camera movements, as a way of redefining a place and its geography. Sections of the landscape are documented by moving the camera upside/down, one frame at the time, along a track. The film moves between different topographies and locations in the Kola Peninsula, Northern Russia
