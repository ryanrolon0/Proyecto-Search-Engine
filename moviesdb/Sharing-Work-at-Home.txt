Sharing Work at Home

 The Taylor family lives in a pretty sloppy home, and don't seem to really care very much about its condition. One day daughter Martha brings home some tips she has learned in her Home Economics class, and persuades the rest of the family to start picking up after themselves, to get organized and to make lists of things that need to be done and who should do them. Before they know it the Taylors are happy, well adjusted and just like every other family on their block--as, of course, all right-thinking American families should be--because they listened to tips from a high-school Home Ec class.
