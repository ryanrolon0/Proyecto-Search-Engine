Walt Disney Is Cryogenically Frozen

 On December 15th, 1966, Walter Elias Disney passed away. On October 3rd, 1995, Sean Patrick O'Brien was born. Sean Patrick O'Brien has been making movies since he was seven years old. Recently he made a film trilogy consisting of three movies. These movies were called Bambi & Thumper, Walt Disney Is Cryogenically Frozen, and Dawn of the Disney. Sean came up with the idea to edit them into one big 42 minuet film and send them to film festivals. The film uses familiar characters such as Bambi, Walt Disney, Goofy, Flower, and Thumper and it also introduces some unfamiliar faces such as Bipolar the rejected 8th dwarf and The Guy With the Goggles.
