The Great Bikini Off-Road Adventure

 An ancient American Indian burial ground is threatened by an evil real estate developer when the owner of the land (who runs a local off road jeep tour company) has trouble with his business. His beautiful neice and her crew of beautiful friends take over the jeep tours and attract business and save the day the old fashioned way, by taking their tops off during the tours they are leading.
