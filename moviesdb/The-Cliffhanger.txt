The Cliffhanger

 When the mysterious Iris Peterson arrives at a rundown motel in Chicago, she brings with her mementos of a perverse family secret that put into motion a series of nefarious events. Now, as Anthony fights to save his brother Darius from a life of indiscretions and a terrified Nellie attempts to exorcise the demons of her past, games are played by a cast of characters so twisted it is impossible to predict who will be left standing at the end of it all, and who among them will ultimately find the redemption that each of them so desperately seek.
