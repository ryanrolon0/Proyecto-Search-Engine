Shock! Shock! Shock!

 It begins with the most evil cry, deep from the twisted shadows of the night. Then, its laughter, like some insane dog ringing in your ears, it comes with the flaming jaws of hungry horror. Oh yes, it hungers...for you! Run! Run! But there is no escape for you who will see the terrible true story of a man caught in the icy fingers of Shock! Shock! SHOCK!
