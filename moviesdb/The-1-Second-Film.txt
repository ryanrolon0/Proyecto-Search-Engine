The 1 Second Film

 A collaborative non-profit epic that climaxes in one second of animation. The animation consists of 12 frames- each frame is a giant painting (5ft x 9ft) that was created by hundreds of people in one night. Each painting was then filmed twice (on 70mm) to create the 24 frames in one second of film. The 1 Second Film is being financed by thousands of people around the world, from some of Hollywoods biggest celebrities to great-grandmothers and gas-station attendants (credits are sold for as little as $1 and listed in order of the amount). A feature-length 'making of' documentary will play during the film's estimated 90 minutes of end-credits. After the film's premiere, the 12 giant frames will be on exhibit and auctioned off to raise money for the Global Fund for Women.
