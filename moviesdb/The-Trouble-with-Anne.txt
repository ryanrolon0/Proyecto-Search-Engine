The Trouble with Anne

 Anne is a young woman with trouble-many troubles, to be precise. Set over the course of a single day, Nicholas J. Hagen's nonlinear portrait of Anne (Elle Poindexter) becomes a disturbing glimpse into a life of self-destructive uncertainty and violence. Multiple story lines lay bare her interactions of the day, until all come together into a powerful conclusion. Anne Winter lives a life of depression, masochism and isolation in the small Oregon town in which she is a ballet teacher. Suicidal and unable to deal with her sexuality, she retreats deeper into her dark world of nightmares after having spent too much time with her eighteen-year-old ballet student with whom she cannot reconcile her feelings. Love could not be a possibility. Or is it? To make matters worse, she is having a loveless affair with Kate's father. Anne thought her life was as miserable as possible until her abusive ex-husband, James, unexpectedly arrives back in town. Will Anne be able to escape the town that will bring her down with it's misery, or will she endlessly continue into the downward spiral that is engulfing her?
