 Raja (Rabia Jawed) was quiet high school senior until 5 drunk guys from her school, led by Chet Baker (Chris Izzo), killed Raja's mother in a hit-and-run driving accident. Now Raja is out for revenge. Alongside her best friend Emma (Emily Siner), Raja hatches a plan to use her friends to lure the five guys into the woods and kill them. When the girls begin to die as well, Raja realizes something is amiss. Now everyone is in the same boat to figure out who the killer is before the Slaughter Massacre begins. Director A.
