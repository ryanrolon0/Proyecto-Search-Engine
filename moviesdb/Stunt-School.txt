Stunt School

 Stunt School is just the place for a group of misfits to find a job they might be great at, like falling off buildings, being set on fire or flipping a car over. It's a crazy and hilarious journey for everyone. This rag-tag group struggles to make it, almost killing themselves, but manage to surprise everyone.
