The Great Lester Boggs

 Malcolm's cross-country motorcycle odyssey - just for the experience - "boggs" down in Arkansas, where he acquires his sidekick, LeRoy; befriends moonshine-drinkin', bi-plane stunt pilot, Lester Boggs; falls in love with level-headed Susan; and, all the while, confounds Sheriff Billy Bob and his department.
