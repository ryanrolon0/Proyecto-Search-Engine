Undying

 Patrick Galloway is a former soldier turned writer and an authority on occult phenomena. In 1922 he recieves a plea for help from his old friend and former comrade in arms Jeremiah Covenant. It seems that something very strange and gruesome is happening at the Covenant estate. Believing his old friend to be exagerating, Galloway travels to the Covenant estate in Ireland. He soon realises that Jeremiah Covenant has not been exagerating at all -- quite the opposite. Ireland, 1923 A.D. You are Patrick Galloway, former veteran of World War 1. Forced to flee your native Ireland years ago after a set-up by your hated rival, the black magician Keisinger, you travelled the world and are now a recognized authority on the occult. Now, a letter has reached you, from your old friend and commander Jeremiah Covenant, who saved your life during World War 1 and earned a life-debt from you. Already dying of cancer, Jeremiah pleads with you to return to Ireland and help him, for it seems that something very strange and unnatural is taking place at the Covenant Estate. True to your debt, you break your long exile and return to Ireland, to the estate, where you discover that all is not what it seems. Jeremiah's four siblings have recently died and returned to dark unlife --- to claim their last, living brother and thus complete the dreadful Curse of the Undying King which they unwittingly unleashed decades ago as children. To save Jeremiah, you must embark on a lone quest to confront the four undead Covenant siblings and triumph over your old adversary Keisinger, before unearthing the final, darkest mystery of the Undying curse. You are Patrick Galloway. Live the horror, or die trying.
