Raising Cassidy

 Raising Cassidy is a dramatic, troubling, and at times heroic story of a woman's battle with addiction, when the stakes are the highest. Cheryl is a 33-year old stripper and crack addict who has had three children, but raised none of them. Her first child she gave up through private adoption, while the second and third were both taken before their first birthday by the Ontario Children's Aid Society (CAS). Now Cassidy, Cheryl's fourth child, has also been apprehended by CAS after Cheryl gave birth high on crack. This documentary records Cheryl's battle to regain custody and raise her fourth daughter, Cassidy. An inspirational and provocative story; it is a defining example of the struggle to break cycles of abuse and poverty. Narrated by the director, the film offers an intimate account of a woman torn between motherhood and addiction.
