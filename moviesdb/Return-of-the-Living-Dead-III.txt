Return of the Living Dead III

 Colonel Reynolds and his group of government scientists continue their work on re-animating the dead for military use. His son Curt and his girlfriend Julie use Dad's security pass to sneak in and watch the proceedings. Later when father and son have a disagreement, Curt and Julie take off on a motorcycle and Julie is killed in an accident. Grief-stricken, Curt takes her body to the lab and brings her back to life. Curt must help Julie deal with her new existence as military agents and local gang members try to find them. Curt loved Julie very much. So much so, when she asked Curt to break into his Father's top secret army test center he agrees. What they discover is that they are testing the zombie gas to see if it can become a usable bio-weapon against terrorist and communist countries. They escape after letting one of the monsters loose and while in the mist of a blind panic, Curt crashes his motorcycle. Killing Julie when she goes flying off the bike. Curt can't live without her and again sneaks on the base, (great security) and uses the gas on Julie. Now Julie starts to act strange and when she takes a bite out of a Latino gang member, they are chased and perhaps a new wave of zombies maybe unleashed on the unsuspecting city.
