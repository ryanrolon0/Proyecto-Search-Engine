Unveiling the Rochambeau Statue, Washington, D.C.

 The statue is shown in the immediate foreground, draped with the American and French flags. The Rochambeau party all appear in the immediate foreground of the picture, and the unveiling is plainly shown, the flags being hauled down by President Roosevelt amid the great cheering of the throng of officials and citizens assembled. Immediately after the unveiling a panoramic view of the crowd is made, which is very interesting.
