The Gift of All

 The Gift of All philanthropy. Our backdrop is the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The community's history, from a city in decline during the Great Depression in the 1930s to a place of great importance in the 21st century is a fascinating drama of pivotal moments of decision-making, courageous risk-taking, visionary thinking and just plain hard work all told in the lives and in the words of those who helped to make it happen.
