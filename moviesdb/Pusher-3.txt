Pusher 3

 In this third installment of the 'Pusher' trilogy, we follow Milo ('Zlatko Buric'(qv)), the drug lord from the two first films. He is aging, he is planning his daughter's 25th birthday and his shipment of heroin turns out to be 10.000 pills of ecstasy. When Milo tries to sell the pills anyway, all Hell breaks loose and his only chance is to ask for help from his ex-henchman and old friend Radovan ('Slavko Labovic'(qv)).
