Storm

 On a sunny Spring day, Tasha makes an unexpected visit to her estranged mother, Jill, an artist who lives in a beautiful but isolated cottage situated on the Cornish coast. Tasha hasn't forgiven her mother for dumping her father in favour of Nicky, a younger woman, but she needs money ... Jill agrees to write a cheque for £1,000 if Tasha will stay to dinner. However, when Nicky serves up rabbit stew, "something the dog's caught", Tasha takes it as a personal insult and decides to leave. She is furious when Jill consequently withdraws the offer of the cheque and storms out of the cottage. Angry and depressed, Jill starts drinking. Recognising all too familiar signs of trouble, Nicky takes Skipper, her beloved dog, out to the wood shed to wait out the storm.
