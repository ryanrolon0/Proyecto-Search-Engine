Rescue Dog

 The high mountains are a dangerous place for humans, so valiant rescue dogs mount the guard, keeping their casks of brandy at the ready. So does Pluto, too proud to play a single paw-move with a jolly polar seal-pup, who simply sees the wooden thing as a fun toy, but the bumbling beast soon discovers the perils of the ice-scape extend to canines who snootily stick their snout too high to see where they tread caught under it and passes out. The slick seal bravely dives in after him to pull his unwilling playmate out, already covered in a huge ice-block, and puts the cask to miraculously effective use on its carrier.
