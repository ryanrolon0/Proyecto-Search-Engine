The Legend

 In an unknown part of the Midwest, patrons discuss the current activity of crime happening around their small town. They get onto the story of The Legend, who was this mythical outlaw who did good deeds for the needy. After the story is told, a ruthless man named Giles comes into the diner demanding The Legend, threatening everyone's lives. The town drunk, who is cruel and vulgar and hates the story about The Legend, becomes the target and is thrown outside to be executed. The drunk outsmarts Giles, and shoots him, killing Giles. As the drunk and patrons go back inside so the drunk can clean himself up, one of the patrons named Ricky realizes that the drunk is actually The Legend. When he confronts the drunk, the drunk tells him that the original story was nothing more than a desperate man looking for easy money. As the drunk walks away from the diner and the town, Ricky asks another patron Sam if the drunk was The Legend. Sam simply replies, "No, that was just a man.", indicating that whether or not the stories that both the patrons and the drunk told are true is ambiguous.
