Real Stories of the Donut Men

 A spoof of the television series Cops. After being hassled and beat up by some LAPD officers, filmmaker Juan Pelotes decides to get revenge by creating a mockumentary that satirizes L.A.'s boys in blue. Enlisting the aid of two Latinos just released from police custody, Pelotes costumes his stars in police uniforms and follows them around the city with a camera, recording their staged antics of bullying citizens and propositioning beautiful women.
