Thrillkill

 Karlie Kendall's job is to write computer games - but in her spare time she hacks bank accounts. With 5 million dollars gathered, she wants to retire to Brazil - unaware that her secret partner Adrienne intends to keep all the money. Moreover, Karlie's boss Julien has got to know of her doing and has hired villains to get hold of the treasure. Only after Karlie's death they realize that she has hidden the money well inside the computer game "Thrillkill" - leaving the single clue to her sister, stewardess Bobbie.
