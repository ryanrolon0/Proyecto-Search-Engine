Utah Blaine

 When Utah Blaine rescues Joe Neal from being lynched by a pack of land-grabbing vigilantes, Joe hires Utah has his ranch foreman. Aided at first by only a fellow gunslinger, Utah gradually rallies the townsman to his cause for a climatic showdown with Russ Nevers, his murderous henchman Rink Witter and their pack of range-wolves.
