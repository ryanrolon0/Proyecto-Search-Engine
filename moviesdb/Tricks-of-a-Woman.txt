Tricks of a Woman

 Dessi, a down and out young woman, is wasting her life away. One day a fashion photographer, Rex, notices her on an outing with his rival, Albert. Rex reluctantly accepts a bet that he can transform Dessi into a super-model. Dessi transforms herself from ugly duckling to swan -- only to learn she was the object of a bet.
