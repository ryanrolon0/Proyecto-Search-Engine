 Visualize a painting on the wall, an intriguing abstract. You glance at it and turn away. The next time you look at it, you notice the painting has completely changed. You begin staring at it and discover that the painting is changing all the time. Images slowly morph, as do colors, shapes and even brush strokes. It's a living picture in the state of perpetual transformation. The pace of transformation is soothing, the colors are vibrant and the shapes conjure up positive emotional associations. In the background the sound of water, a bird chirping, ambient soundscapes that seem dynamically connected to the images. Is it art or is it therapy? Canadian artist San Base is a pioneer of a new kind of art that utilizes the classical elements of painting and music, while harnessing the power of computer technology to seamlessly integrate all three disciplines. He named this art Dynamic Painting. Dynamic Paintings are composed of abstract images and sound in a state of perpetual transformation. The basic idea of the composition remains unchanged, while the computer introduces infinite variations. The picture and sound lives its own life with objects moving and transforming but still following the artist's original concept. Dynamic Paintings can provide a form of stimulation that evokes changes in physiological activity to improve health and performance. It is a great outlet for relaxation, meditation and spiritual awareness and stimulates a variety of emotional and mental states that can help alleviate anxiety and treat stress.
