Tapja õllejogurti rünnak

 This lovely, super-low-budget "adventure movie" about the Killer Beer Yoghurt terrorizing the Estonian countryside features a group of university students known as the Õ-Fraktsioon in a multitude of roles. A true Estonian version of Monty Python's works, this film shows an intrepid knight trying in vain to save innocent virgins (he just can't seem to be able to find them). Instead, he finds that some curious monks have accidentally released the Killer Beer Yoghurt into the world and the insiduous white substance now inhabits host bodies and wreaks havoc in the community.
