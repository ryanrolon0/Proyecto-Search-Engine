Shaky Souls, Empty Chairs, Testing Times

 In Mumbai, Shobnath Yadhav, is tested for HIV, uninformed, by a private hospital and is refused an emergency operation. Although a second HIV test proves that the first test is a case of false negative, Yadhav has been fighting rampant discrimination. Dayanand Narvekar, the health minister of the western Indian tourism oriented state of Goa, is determined to initiate a law that makes pre-marital HIV testing compulsory, despite protests from the church and the local activists. In Mangalore, South India, a self declared HIV positive Seema Mathaiz counsels the virtues of adherence to medicines used in AIDS treatment. Although government provides the treatment free of costs to people who test themselves voluntarily, there is no provision for the second line drugs.
