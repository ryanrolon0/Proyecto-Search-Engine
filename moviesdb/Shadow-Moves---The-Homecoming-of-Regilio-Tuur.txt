Shadow Moves - The Homecoming of Regilio Tuur

 The documentary tells the story of Regilio Tuur, a former WBO lightweight champion who, after a five-year break, prepares himself for a comeback. The film starts in New York where he trains at Gleasons Gym in Brooklyn. It follows the Dutch fighter up to and including his first fight in the Netherlands. His so called "homecoming fight". In between his preparations he has to deal with a number of issues that have cumulated from the past. Tuur is a controversial person in the Netherlands due to a history of domestic violence of which he speaks in interviews in the film. Will his past catch up with him? By showing the ins and outs that will lead to his first "homecoming fight" in combination with the interviews as a counterpoint, the film has a dramatic unravelling effect, which not only reveals if Tuur wins or looses, but also shows an insight in his motivation and historic background. The film was selected for and had it's world premiere at the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) 2002. Out of almost 3000 entries only a 100 films were selected. The documentary was shown on Dutch television in January 2003.
