The Flew

 A mechanical man, within an elaborate shooting gallery at a Victorian carnival, lives beyond his monotonous existence. He falls in love with a broken down ride, The Wooden Embalmer, his only view outside his window. The afflicted beekeeper's role in the shooting gallery and his dreamy hallucinations vacillate until they are almost indistinguishable.
