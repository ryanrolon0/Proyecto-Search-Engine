Sons of New Mexico

 In addition to his duties as executor of an estate Gene must keep a juvenile delinquent from the clutches gambler Feeney who hopes to get at the money through the kid. Gene Autry, named as the executor of an estate belonging to Randy Pryor, enters his young, headstrong ward in New Mexico Military Institute, the famous military-prep school in Roswell, New Mexico, in an effort to get him away from the influence of gamblers led by Pat Feeney and Gig Jackson. When the gang frames Randy for a killing, Gene, Eileen McDonald, Randy's cousin, and the hard-riding cadets of NMMI swing into action to clear his name.
