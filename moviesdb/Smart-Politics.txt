Smart Politics

 The growth of juvenile crime in a small town starts a movement for the building of a youth center. The project leaders discuss with the town mayor Phineas Wharton Sr.('Donald MacBride' (qv)) about buying an old warehouse from the city, and rebuilding it as the Center. The mayor, however, has his own plans to buy it himself for another project which he would profit from. The Teen-Agers, now attending San Juan Junior College, Freddy Trimball ('Freddie Stewart' (qv)), Dodie Rogers ('June Preisser' (qv)), Lee Watson ('Warren Mills (I)' (qv)), Betty Rogers ('Noel Neill' (qv)), Roy Donne ('Frankie Darro' (qv)) and the rest of Monogram's non-delinquent juveniles, think otherwise and, while the mayor does buy the warehouse, he is forced to donate it to the Youth Center committee. Cappa Barra's Harmonica Boys are NOT in this film. Credited are 'The Harmonica Boys'---Breezie ('George Offerman Jr.' (qv)), Eddie ('George Fields' (qv)), Joe ('Don Ripps' (qv) and Johnny ('Dick Paxton' (qv)). They steal some fireworks, get chased by the police and barge into the gymnasium while Dodie is entertaining.
