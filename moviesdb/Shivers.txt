Shivers

 A scientist living in an apartment complex kills a girl and uses acid to destroy her internal organs, and then kills himself. While investigating, a doctor discovers that the scientist was doing experiments on the use of genetically engineered parasites as organ transplants. Soon, other people in the complex begin showing signs of carrying the parasites, spreading the things through wanton orgiastic abandon, and the complex begins suffering an attrition problem. In the fancy Starliner compound in an island near MontrEal, a mad scientist tests a parasite in the body of his mistress. He believes that human is an animal that thinks too much, and he develops a parasite to increase the violence and sexual desire of humankind. There is an outbreak in the condominium, with the dwellers becoming fierce zombies of sex.
