Tervitusi Nõukogude Eestist!

 Their story begins in a similar way - 20 years ago they were all persecuted by the Soviet system and were known dissidents among the people. Now they are in this film, and that is all that they still have in common - the eternal rebel Tiit, who has already attempted to overthrow the government in free Estonia, Tunne, a member of the European Parliament, and Lagle, who has found herself as one of the Order of Nuns of St. Bridget. Over 15 years have passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Estonia is richer than ever before. Nevertheless, sociologists describe an unexpected phenomenon over half of the formerly Soviet era people find that life was better back then. People did not work until they dropped, their neighbors did not live significantly better than they themselves, and people like Tunne, Tiit and Lagle were looked upon more as eccentrics...We observe these three, along with amusing archive films about how beautiful life was in the Soviet Union. We try to comprehend why they did not adapt, and whether the cause of their suffering has now been realized.
