This Girl

 At twenty eight years old Missy has everything going for her; great looks, great job, fabulous wardrobe and a cute little art deco apartment in the heart of the inner city. But for all those blessings there is one thing she can't quite seem to get Reaper, the Grim Reaper, and Missy's thoughts turn from love forever to life ever lasting.
