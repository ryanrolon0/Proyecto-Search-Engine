Tommy Atkins Bathing

 A fine picture, showing a company of English soldiers marching through a wood to their favorite bathing place. The scene then changes and shows a large body of Tommy Atkins' clad in bathing trunks, diving and jumping from a spring board in rapid succession. Beautiful water effects.
