Private Affairs

 Amos Bullerton, son of an old Boston family, has chosen for twenty years to remain a "black sheep" rather than submit to the dictation of his staid family. Jane Bullerton, his daughter, finds herself in the same quandary, ordered by her crotchety grandfather, Noble Bullerton, to marry a man she doesn't love.
