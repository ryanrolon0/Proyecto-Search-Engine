Une place dans mon coeur

 At the early morning, in the beginning of the winter, Paris wakes up. In the Olympia theatre, a small world is already swarming before the premiere of Mireille Mathieu's concert. Everything progressively finds its place in the red velour house of l'Olympia. Backstage, with the family of Mireille, we discover the technical team, close relations, friends, the OB van, and the magic lair of l'Olympia. A limousine arrives, a silhouette emerges from the crowd, furtive, it is rare, it is precious.
