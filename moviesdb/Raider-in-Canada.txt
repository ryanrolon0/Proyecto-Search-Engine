Raider in Canada

 For the past seven years, cartoonist Sean Martin has brought to life the characters of "Doc and Raider", two Gay men in a committed relationship who deal with AIDS, homophobia and everyday life in the nineties. The documentary, using the framework of a Calgary Gay rodeo that Sean Martin participates in each year, looks at the influences on Martin's work and the search for his own space within the Gay community.
