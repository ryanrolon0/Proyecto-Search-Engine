Raging Grannies

 A lively and thought-provoking portrait of The Action League of the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula. They are women over 50, some as old as 90, who are enraged by the conditions under which some people are forced to live their lives, by threats to our environment, by war and nuclear weapons, and by injustice wherever they find it. In ostrich feathers and crazy hats the Action League has been both booed and cheered, but they continue to protest with a sense of outrage, a sense of humor, and a commitment to non-violence.
