The Prisoner of Swing

 Mr. Razzenstill, a saxophonist and dancer who specializes in swing music, comes to the kingdom of Sulvania looking for a job. Unbeknownst to him, he looks exactly like King Rudolph. At a ball to celebrate his upcoming coronation, Rudolph declares that swing music will be outlawed once he is crowned. The king is kidnapped by swing music lovers, and the look-alike takes the king's place.
