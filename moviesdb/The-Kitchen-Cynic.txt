The Kitchen Cynic

 Edgar Kennedy's brother-in-law finds what he thinks is a missing boy, whose return carries a $500 reward, and takes him the Edgar's home. Once there, the kid turns into a brat and begins to make life miserable for Edgar, whose tolerance is running low, reward or no reward. Then they learn the kid is just playing hookey from school and hiding from the truant officer, and not the one carrying a reward for his return. On his way out, the kid gives Edgar an exploding cigar.
