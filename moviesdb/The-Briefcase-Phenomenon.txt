The Briefcase Phenomenon

 The film cuts back and forth between the past and present of the protagonist Hanlon. His ten year old dreams of being a ballet dancer where never realised, and now he works at an office job he hates. But all that changes thanks to the hosts of a tacky infomercial he sees one morning and the 'Briefcase Phenomenon' they are advertising.
