Sista ringen

 Eric and Clarence are friends from the same class in school - but from different social classes. Eric comes from the working class, Clarence from the upper class. Eric regards his studies as a way of getting somewhere, while Clarence is only interested for the drawing lessons. There are only a few months left until graduation. Clarence behaves very provocatively against the art teacher 'Sjasen'.
