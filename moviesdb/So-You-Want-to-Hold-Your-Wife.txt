So You Want to Hold Your Wife

 Joe McDoakes has been married to his wife Alice McDoakes for five years, but around year three, he began to feel dissatisfied with the marriage. Seeking help from an on-air marriage counselor named Mr. Agony whose tag line is "how to be happy tho married", Joe spills his heart out on the radio program. On the advice of Mr. Agony, Joe decides to make a concerted effort to live harmoniously with Alice. The one thing he may have troubles with, and which bothers him the most, is her snoring, which he can't tell her she does. So he goes to extreme measures to solve that most tricky problem, with unintended consequences. Joe McDoakes goes on "The Hour of Agony" radio and tells Dr. Agony of his marriage problems. His biggest problem is that his wife, Alice, snores. Joe has even more problems trying to follow Dr. Agony's instructions.
