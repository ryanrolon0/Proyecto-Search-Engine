Teenage Gang Debs

 A no-good Manhattan girl moves in on a Brooklyn gang. Using her obvious charms she gets the leader killed in a fight over her and then takes up with the victor and new head man. Then she starts pushing him to get out onto the streets to mix it with rival gangs. A girl from Manhattan moves into a neighborhood that is the turf of the Rebels, a female teenage gang. She quickly rises to the top of the gang, and sets her sights on the leader of the local neighborhood tough guys.
