The Black Diamond Express

 When Dick, an aeronaut [sic] is wrongly accused of shooting Dan, a trouble-making, quarrelsome cowboy, Helen aids his escape on the outgoing Black Diamond Express. The cowboy's friends pursue the train, Helen takes to the air, heads them off, rescues Dick in the nick of time, proves his innocence, and rescues him from a lynching mob. At the final fadeout, Helen refuses marriage proposals from both Dan and Dick, preferring to pursue further hazards of her own next week.
