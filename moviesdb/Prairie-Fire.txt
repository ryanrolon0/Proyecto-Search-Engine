Prairie Fire

 On May 15, 1919, the largest labour uprising in Canadian history saw 25,000 people, virtually every working man and woman in Canada's third largest city, walk off their jobs. Winnipeg was paralyzed. The country was in shock and in fear. The film combines eyewitness accounts with archival images to tell the story. Historians and labour leaders give their perspective on the impact of the strike then and how it has influenced Canada's labour movement to this day.
