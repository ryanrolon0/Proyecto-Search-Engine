The Gate

 In the tradition of the TWILIGHT ZONE, THE GATE is the story of two strangers, who seemingly have nothing in common, that meet in an airport terminal while waiting for their flights. Evan recently graduated law school. Aiya is a young actress. The friendly and energetic Aiya notices that something is troubling Evan, who's sitting lost in thought, and takes it upon herself to cheer him up. However, things are not as they seem. During their conversation Evan becomes aware that he has no idea what he's doing in the airport, and worse, is having difficulty remembering details of his own life. Can Aiya help him regain his memory, or is the happy-go-lucky actress not what she appears to be?
