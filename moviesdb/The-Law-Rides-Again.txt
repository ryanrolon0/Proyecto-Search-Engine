The Law Rides Again

 US government agents Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson, aka "The Trail Blazers", make a deal with captured outlaw Duke Dillon to catch crooked Indian agent John Hampton, who has been using his authority to steal from the local tribe. Dillon double-crosses the inept and lethargic heroes, making it difficult for them to carry out their mission. The Indians are on the warpath and Ken and Hoot have been sent to investigate. They catch an outlaw and he leads them to the Indian Agent Hampton. When Ken searches Hampton's office he finds evidence that Hampton has been cheating the Indians. Hampton learns his racket has been exposed and musters him men. Finding themselves greatly outnumbered, Hoot sends for the soldiers.
