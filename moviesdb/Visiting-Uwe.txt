Visiting Uwe

 Fabian Hübner (avant*garde) is visiting film director Uwe Boll (BloodRayne). During the 50-minutes- documentary he gets a guided tour of the house and talks with Boll about Arthouse and Trash movies as well as the controversy surrounding his person. "Visiting Uwe - The Uwe Boll Homestory" gives the viewer a special insight into the private life of the German born director and addresses topics, which one wouldn't normally link to Uwe Boll.
