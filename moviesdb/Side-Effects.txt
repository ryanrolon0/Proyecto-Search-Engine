Side Effects

 'Side Effects' is a darkly humorous tale of a healthy young man who gets seduced by the pharmaceutical industry, and finds himself embroiled in a catch 22 of side effects - popping one pill to get rid of the pernicious side effects of another. Ultimately Zubi (Csaba S. Lucas) finds himself recycled by the system both professionally and personally.
