The Relationship

 This film explores the relationship of Canada and the United States. It is a relationship that first began with hostility with the American Revolution through the War of 1812. Then it gradually changed to the point where Canada is now closely linked to the States militarily and economically. Furthermore, the film explores the ambivalent attitude most Canadians hold for America, in that while Canadians take advantage of the economic benefits and entertainment products of the States, there is always this underlying resentment of their powerful political and economic influence. Furthermore, there is the fear that they will be absorbed into the United States itself since at least the English speaking population can't seem to define their identity apart from the fact they are not American themselves.
