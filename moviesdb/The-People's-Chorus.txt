The People's Chorus

 The People's Chorus follows a unique choral event - a day in which 800 members of the public came together to rehearse and perform Thomas Tallis' 'Spem in Alium' in Manchester's Bridgewater Hall, lead by conductor David Lawrence. 'Spem in Alium' is one of the greatest musical compositions of all time - supremely beautiful and much-loved, but not often performed, as it was written for eight choirs of five parts each. The programme reveals the technique and complexity of Tallis' extraordinary work, as it discovers what happens when all the voices come together with only a single day of rehearsals. Participants travelled from all over the country, and even abroad, with many having no previous experience of singing in public, all culminating in the final performance of this marvellous and sublime piece of music.
