The Outskirts

 A dusty road twists and turns, yielding secrets and deception. Two men, hitchhiker Frank and Good Samaritan William, meet by chance one overcast, summer afternoon. The two men, seemingly strangers, have more in common than either of them knows. As they drive toward the Outskirts, a local bar, they learn about each other, about themselves, and about the line separating life and death ? and what happens when that line is crossed. ?The Outskirts? is, despite its short running time, a complex film, layered with interconnected characters and subplots. This first work from Southern independent filmmakers Rick Baldwin and Joshua Hollis will leave you craving more. Eagle-eyed viewers will want to sit through the end credits to have all their questions answered.
