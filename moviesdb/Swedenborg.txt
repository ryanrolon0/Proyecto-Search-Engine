Swedenborg

 This film looks at how the Swedeish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg's writing in the 1700s came to influence people in Western Canada and Southern Ontario, many of them becoming influential politicians, businessmen, law makers, and builders. We follow the story from when one person found a book in the mid-1800s in an old box to another who heard a new interpretation of an Old Testament story leading him to question his Mennonite background. Eventually we see his influence in everything from writers to sculptors to architects to Hollywood stories.
