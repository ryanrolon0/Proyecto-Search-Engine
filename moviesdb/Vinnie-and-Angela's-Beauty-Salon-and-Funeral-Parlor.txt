Vinnie and Angela's Beauty Salon and Funeral Parlor

 At Vinnie & Angela's neighborhood beauty salon in Rhode Island, frequented by local wise guys, they've added a sideline... funeral parlor. When "made" boss Big Tony informs them that his sister has died in a skiing accident, Vinnie and Angela proudly offer to prepare the body for funeral. Big Tony gives them a photo to help reconstruct his sister's face for the open casket. Vinnie and Angela, work through the night, knowing that if they screw up... they too will get a Mafia make over.
