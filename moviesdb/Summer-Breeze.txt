Summer Breeze

 Paul is a young, quiet man who spends time listening to music and reading on the river bank, but when Hannah suddenly appears his lazy summer afternoon is thrown out of sync for good and for bad. Hannah slowly chips away at Paul's defenses, and with a little female persuasion he eventually opens up to her. In the whirlwind of their summer romance they decide to run away together the following day.
