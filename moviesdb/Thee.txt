Thee

 Bombay-based Sita is compelled to live a near-destitute life, along with her two sons, Rajshekhar and Ravi, after her Union-leader husband is branded a thief, and disappears. Rajshekhar bears the brunt of the abuse poverty brings in, watches angrily as his mother slaves to bring home food for them. He drops studies, becomes a coolie with a badge No.786; eventually joins a gang of smugglers led by Madan, and quickly accumulates enough wealth to live a life of luxury. Problems arise after Ravi becomes a Police Inspector and finds out that his brother has obtained wealth through crime. After a labour leader is framed by a mill-owner and publicly dishonoured, he leaves his wife and children to face the wrath of angry mill workers. His elder son is badly affected by the hard childhood, drops out of school and grows up to be a violent mafia don (Rajnikant). The younger son, sheltered by his brother and mother, goes through school and college and ends up with a job in the police force.
