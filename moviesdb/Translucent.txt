Her roommate Martin, a pianist, waits on his wife returning before his risky operation. He feels hopeless. Being their sweet companion, Nancy, the freshman nurse, narrates a profound story of living and dying, "Death is not a sad end; no one is alone. Someone else will always be there watching, either in this life or the next."
