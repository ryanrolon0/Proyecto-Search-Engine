The Battle for Georgia

 'The Battle for Georgia' takes us on an eye-opening journey to the rural south in the final weeks of the 2008 Presidential election. Intimately exploring the politics of small town Georgia, the film follows a small team of local volunteers. They are fighting to elect an African-American Democrat in a state with a long legacy of racial unease and deep-rooted southern, conservative politics.
