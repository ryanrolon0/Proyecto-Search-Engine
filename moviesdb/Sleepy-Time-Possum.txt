Sleepy Time Possum

 Forest-dwelling possums, Ma and Pa O'Possum, are frustrated with their son, Junior, who is hanging from a tree by his tail, sleeping, instead of doing his chores. Pa dresses like a dog to suddenly awaken Junior and scare him, in the hope that this will teach the young possum a lesson. Even though the precocious Junior is not frightened in the least by Pa's disguise, he runs away and leads his dad on a chase through the forest.
