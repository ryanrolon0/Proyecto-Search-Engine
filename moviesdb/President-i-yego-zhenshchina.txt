President i yego zhenshchina

 During the 1996 Russian Presidential elections, the team of advisors for one of the candidates are disturbed by the fact that he seems to have concealed from them the existence of an ex-wife. In order to defuse what they perceive as a potentially damaging situation, they decide to invite her to join their team, thus showing the voters and the country a fine example of a civilised divorce.
