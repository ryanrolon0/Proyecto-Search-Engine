Queerft

 Twelve short films which defend subversive values in contemporary creation, and which aim at transgressing norms while contesting and deconstructing their power. The challenge of this politically uncorrect process represent the plurality of difference and the polymorphism of the identity mosaic by excluding all forms of censorship. The queer concept is, here, the expression of life itself as an artistic act.
