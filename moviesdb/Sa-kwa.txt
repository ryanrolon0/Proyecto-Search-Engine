Sa-kwa

 A woman must deal with the sudden, unexpected death of her husband in a car accident. During the traditional Confucian funeral, she feels suffocated by all the other people around her and this stress triggers a fantasy that is staged as a joyous musical. In this melange of reality and fantasy, a beautiful young boy comes up to her.
