Resan bort

 Bernt comes to a small town to rob the bank. But behind the counter stands his old friends Hjalmar, and he has to pretend it was all a joke. Hjalmar asks him to spend the night at their home. He meets Ellen, now Hjalmar's wife. Bernt is still attracted to her and it was only a coincidence that it was Hjalmar who married her and not Bernt. When Hjalmar goes on a business trip, Bernt stays with Ellen.
