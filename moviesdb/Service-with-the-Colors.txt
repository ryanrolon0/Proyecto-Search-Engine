Service with the Colors

 This Warner Bros. short film focuses on new army recruits prior to the U.S. entry into World War II. They are assigned to the Presidio in San Francisco and put under the command of Sgt. Clicker for their basic training. One of the recruits, Chuck Corbin, has something of a chip on his shoulder and doesn't seem to fit in. The Sergeant is patient and helpful and helps him along. As they improve their skills and enjoy their time off, Chuck ends up spending time in the guard house and decides to desert. When he puts his life on the line to save some of his friends, he's given a break and takes on a new more positive attitude. This drama is "dedicated to the soldiers of the United States Army." Men with diverse backgrounds enlist in the army and are all assigned to the same post. Some adapt easily to army life, while others have trouble making the adjustment.
