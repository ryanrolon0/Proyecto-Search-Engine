Shadowland

 The story is set in a place called Attic Town, where the Great Syndicate robs and kills anyone who stands in their way. A boy named Frank (Pidgeon) and his sister Caroline (Podbielska) find themselves in Attic Town after investigating strange noises coming from the house top. Scared and confused, Frank and Caroline must find their way back home, all the while avoiding danger at every turn. Frank and his sister Caroline arrive in mystical Attic Town where The Great Syndicate is ruling and robbing the citizens. An Army of Shadows kidnaps anyone who's out after dark and the Patrolling Thieves make the daylight miserable for everyone. If you go to Attic Town you'll find a place where the streets have no names and you can never turn back.
