Twisted Illusions

 Seven short stories are present in this anthology movie inspired by CREEPSHOW and TWILIGHT ZONE. Anything from an ear of corn to a vacuum cleaner are taken from their normal use and turned into a twisted illusion! And don't forget our resident psycho, who makes even Norman Bates look sane!
