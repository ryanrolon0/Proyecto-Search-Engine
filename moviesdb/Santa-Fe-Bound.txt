Santa Fe Bound

 When Crenshaw kills a bushwhacker he takes his letter of introduction. This letter saves him from hanging when Stanton thinks he is the outlaw he has hired. But Crenshaw is in more trouble when Denton arrives and exposes him as a fake. Riding toward Santa Fe, Tom Crenshaw shoots a bushwhacker who has killed Dad Bates from ambush. Discovering a money belt on Bates, Tom carries it to town, along with a letter he finds in the pocket of the killer, which offers him the means of identifying either of the dead men. In town, Tom has a run-in with gunman One-Shot Morgan and one of Morgan's henchmen sees Tom with the money belt. Tom poses as the renegade who did the killing and is accepted by Morgan and his gang. Tom's plan is working until one of the gang who knew the killer shows up and denounces him as an impostor.
