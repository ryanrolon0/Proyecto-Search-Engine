Steven and Anna

 A 27 year old man comes back to his home town and remembers the summer he spent with his first childhood friend who changed him from a socially awkward child into a mature young adult. What makes this different than a 'Stand by Me' rip off, is that the 8 year old child is played by the 27 year old man.
