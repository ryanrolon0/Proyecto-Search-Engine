Skogen är vår arvedel

 The farmer Per Jonsson doesn't think too well about the factory in the neighbourhood, since he thinks that it destroys the fishing and makes the young people leave the countryside. When the workers at the factory go on strike, they ask him to sell milk to them and let them work in his forest. But Jonsson is stubborn and refuses to give them any help at all.
