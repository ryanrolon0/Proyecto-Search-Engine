Some Kind of Crazy

 Glen was having a nice day...a normal day. Then a call from Lisa and suddenly he finds himself in a dark, disturbing and profoundly funny situation! In a somewhat unconventional scheme to re-ignite the passion between herself and Glen, Lisa has murdered her current boyfriend (Steve), and subsequently her nosey neighbor (Mrs McGillicutty). Now its up to Glen to clean up the situation and save the day!
