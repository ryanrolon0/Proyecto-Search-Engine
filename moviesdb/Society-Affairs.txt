Rick sneaks in the Austins' mansion to find the bride's married sister, Coreena Bushnell, with Tara the younger head maid. Alexis spikes Howard's drink and Rick hides him. Maid Tara offers herself S&M style to Rick in the attic. After the bridesmaids enjoy each other, Rick's "sister" Dorina Austin threatens to tell his bride they had sex unless they actually do it. Rick and Arthur have a bachelor party with musical strippers. Rick hopes the gifts are in the gym, but it's occupied by Arthur and Coreena Bushnell. They stop prematurely, and Rick steps in to learn she can't get orgasms. Atrributing it to drunkenness, Rick sprays Coreena with water and makes her climax. Finally, Rick accidentally enters bride Lillian Bushnell's room, and she decides not to wait for the honeymoon. Rick later learns the bride is a con artist and decides he has had enough with the upper class. He warns Howard in time and at least gets Howard's car in gratitude.
