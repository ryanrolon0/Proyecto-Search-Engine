Terror by Night

 Holmes is hired by Roland Carstairs to prevent the theft of the Star of Rhodesia, an enormous diamond owned by Carstairs' mother, Lady Margaret. Believing the diamond will be stolen on a train trip from London to Edinburgh, Holmes deftly switches diamonds with Lady Margaret while in her compartment. Soon after, Roland is murdered and the fake diamond is stolen. Red herrings abound as Holmes, aided by Dr. Watson and Inspector Lestrade, discover the murderer's hiding place and deduce that long-time foe Moriarty's henchman Colonel Sebastian Moran is somehow involved in the crime. Traveling on the overnight train from London to Edinburgh, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are accompanying Roland Carstairs and his mother. They are there to protect the famed Star of Rhodesia, a 400-plus carat diamond that Mrs Carstairs had received on her 25th wedding anniversary many years before. There had been an attempt to steal the diamond while in London but when young Carstairs is killed and the diamond stolen, Holmes realizes that it must be the work of the noted thief and criminal, Colonel Sebastian Moran.
