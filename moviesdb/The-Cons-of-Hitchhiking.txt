A friendly woman stops to pick up Serena, but Mara is really one of Mr. North's henchwomen, and soon Serena is chloroformed, hogtied and gagged in the backseat of Mara's car. The tables are soon turned and Malachai leads the search for the hitchhiking damsel leaving Mara bound and gagged as punishment for her lack of vigilance.
