Todd then meets Saskia, a daring gypsy girl, who takes him on a journey into a fantasy world of fairies and circus artists, all give him clues as to where he might find his false tooth. He discovers it is at the bottom of the canal. When Saskia distracts the singing boat people Todd is able to take Dan's magnet and the next day fish out his tooth. When it is back in his mouth Saskia says she preferred it before leaving Todd to think what is really important in life.
