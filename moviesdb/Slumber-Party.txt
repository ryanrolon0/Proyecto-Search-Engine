Slumber Party

 When Naomi, a fine, young sexy thing from South Central LA is invited to Palm Springs by her rich Uncle Bob to house sit for the weekend, she jumps at the chance to get out of the hood. But little Miss Naomi doesn't believe in traveling alone, so she has recruited three of her best friends to join her for the weekend for a Slumber Party; enter the hood's finest girls - there's the ultimate pepper spray packing, ghetto girl Neeci, the very snotty, Brittany and we can't forget about the biggest airhead of them all, Alicia. When these four girls get together, there's no telling what's about to happen. Rufus, Uncle Bob's neighbor spies on Naomi and her fly friends and is determined to be a part of their, "Bad Girl Party." He teams up with South Central's infamous twins, Gary and Cary who have a reputation for turning everything upside down wherever they go. Now all the three of them have to do is figure out how to find a way into a party where there are NO BOYS ALLOWED!
