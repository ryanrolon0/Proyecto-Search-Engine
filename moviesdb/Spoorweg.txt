Spoorweg

 The nightmare begins when you lose track of your daughter on a moving train, just when you're on your way to return her to your ex wife. Simultaneously the poetry fest you're setting up begins to fall apart. It all gets worse when you notice the train to be riding in circles... Is it the waking dream of a guilt-ridden father, or could it be the vengeance of his angry little daughter?
