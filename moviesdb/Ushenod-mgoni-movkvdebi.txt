 A film with parallel editing tells about two youngsters from Tbilisi. The action takes place on one frosty day in winter. Zaza is a writer, Mamula is a criminal. They do not know each other. One is driven by a wish to take revenge; the other is driven by love and chivalry... Both are mistaken, as their ambitious decisions resemble a game with fate... Will their roads cross?...
