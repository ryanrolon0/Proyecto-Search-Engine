Salakhain

 Salakhain tells the story of an innocent, hardworking student who comes from a lower middle class family and who is in love with an equally innocent and sweet young girl. A strange twist of events lands him in a dispute with the booty mafia (people facilitating cheating during exams), resulting in his arrest, his father's death and his mother going mad, one following the other in quick succession. In jail he meets a man who knows his enemies well and has his own issues to pick up with them. The rest is a story filled with love, action, revenge and closure.
