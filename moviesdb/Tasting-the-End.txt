Tasting the End

 A chef loses his sense of smell from a botched nose job, and soon gets fired. He then delivers pizzas, and arrives late one night for a delivery, finding a man has killed himself, and realizes that the pizza would've been his last meal. Following this, he gets an opportunity from a death row inmate and a dying uncle, to prepare last meals and redeem himself as a chef.
