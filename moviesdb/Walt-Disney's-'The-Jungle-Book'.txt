Walt Disney's 'The Jungle Book'

 Produced in time for the film's thirtieth anniversary, this made-for-video documentary treats animation fans to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of The Jungle Book, Disney's musical adaptation of Kipling's novel about a boy raised by animals, and one of the last Disney films that Walt Disney himself worked on personally. Narrated by Corey Burton, it includes archive footage of Walt and the teams of Disney animators and voice actors as they worked to bring this family favorite to life.
