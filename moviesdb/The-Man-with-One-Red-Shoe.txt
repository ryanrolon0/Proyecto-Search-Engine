The Man with One Red Shoe

 Cooper, the deputy director of the CIA, wants to be the director. So, he tries to smear the director into resigning or being removed. The director, who knows that Cooper has been bugging him, feeds him some false information--that there's a man who might be able to clear of the charges against him will be arriving at the airport, so he sends his man, Brown to meet him. Brown was just suppose to make contact with anyone at the airport thus making Cooper believe that he is the man who can help the director. Brown picks Richard cause he is wearing mismatched shoes, one of them being red. So Cooper sets up surveillance on Richard and sends his femme fatale, Maddy to come on to him and find out what he knows. While Maddy is playing, Richard actually falls for her. In order to send the CIA on a wild goose chase, Richard is picked out of an airport crowd because of his distinctive odd shoes (one red). With the CIA following every move he makes, the bad guys get some breathing space. One of his CIA followers is the beautiful Maddy. She uses all the tricks to try to get information out of him, but she doesn't count on falling for him. When Richard's practical joking friend Morris hides all but 2 mismatched shoes, he is forced to wear one red shoe back from a trip. A CIA man has to set his watchers on someone and seeing that one eye catcher, fingers Richard as a courier. This excessively complicates his life. Morris is especially hard hit by this as the sudden appearance and disappearance of people and things causes him to wonder about his sanity.
