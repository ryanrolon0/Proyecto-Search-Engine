 The residents of a poor neighbourhood in Piraeus are asked to leave as modernization will take place. The prostitutes of one of the many brothels are preparing to move on. The camera follows their individual stories, their misery, shattered dreams and hopes for a better future. Just a little time before the infamous brothels of Troumba (a slum of Peiraieus) are closed down, the story follows the lives of 5 prostitutes. Anna, in love with a gentle and wise sea captain, tries to hide the existence of her son. Marina is bullied by her good-for-nothing pimp, whom she loves to insanity. Mary falls in love with a teenage boy she deflowers. Myrsini, the youngest, deliberately becomes a prostitute and the madame's pet. But the story focuses most on Eleni, a sensitive refugee from Romania, who tries to hide her "dirty" profession from her beloved and to confront the sick passion of her pimp for her.
