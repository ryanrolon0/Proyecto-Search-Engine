The Tokyo Raiders

 This documentary tells the story of Jimmy Doolittle's daring 1942 air raid on Japan, in which U.S. Army Air Force B-25 medium bombers were launched from the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Hornet, in retaliation for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Included are interviews with surviving members of the group, and a 1992 reunion with some of their Chinese rescuers. The film begins and ends with footage of the 50th anniversary reunion of the Raiders in Columbia, South Carolina--most of the volunteers came from the 17th Bomber Group, which was stationed near Columbia in 1942.
