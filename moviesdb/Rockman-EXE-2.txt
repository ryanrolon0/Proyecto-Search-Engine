Rockman EXE 2

 A new group by the name of Gospel has risen to pick up where WWW left off, and they're seeking to create a 'SuperNavi' to conquer the net. Lan and all his allies must return to action, even traveling overseas in the process, and they've got some new aces in the hole. Use the new style system to change MegaMan's element and abilities, adapting him to whatever may come. Pack some sub-chips to restore his energy, repel enemies, and open certain mystery data that you couldn't before. And don't forget to stock up on plenty of battle-chips, this time over 250 in all. You'll be in for a long, hard journey to Gospel's headquarters, where you'll fight your way to the boss and discover their true motive...
