Rangle River

 Marion Hastings, absent from her Australian home, Rangle River Station, for many years while completing her education in Europe, receives a letter from Dick Drake, her father's ranch foreman, demanding she return home immediately. Marion, together with her chaperon, Aunt Abbie, flies home. While making flight connections at the Singapore Airport, they meet Flight-Lieutenant Reginald Mannister, an Englishman on his way to India. Attracted to Marion, however, he switches his tickets and embarks for Australia, receiving an invitation to stay at Rangle River Station. Upon arrival, Marion discovers Drake fighting with a rival ranch-foreman and, properly disgusted with his improper manners, she gives him a good dressing-down regarding his "brutal exhibition." Arriving at the old homestead, it is obvious to Marion why she has been called home; Rangle River Station is being beset by drought. Meanwhile, Lawton, a neighboring ranch-owner who has designs on the meat-contract held by Dan Hastings,endeavors to impoverish Rangle River Station further by secretly blocking off on his property, the river from which Hastings' cattle get their water. Meanwhile, Reggie flies over Lawton's property and confirms his suspicions that Lawton has dammed up the river. Lawton blows up the dam to free the water. But Marion is galloping up the dry river-bed and is trapped by the torrent of on-rushing water.
