Rollercoaster

 In a desperate hour, five teenagers choose a bankrupt amusement park to let loose and pursue a fantasy. Darrin, his girlfriend Chloe, his best friend Stick, the group clown Sanj and Darrin's tag-along kid brother Justin "borrow" their group home counselor's car for a day of escape at Wonder World. Fueled by booze, drugs and unspoken tensions between them, the friends revel aimlessly through the silent rides in search of Ben, a notorious and apparently teen-friendly security guard. Ben allows them to stay, but in return exacts the most private of fees. Soon the rides are alive, but the fantasy holds little solace for those facing demons. Darrin hatches an alternative plan, and by trapping Ben in the dizzying Zipper, they succeed in commandeering the rides. The blaring music, bright lights and bucketing machines of the midway are a futile escape, for in its midst a darker purpose lurks; after night has fallen, Darrin and Chloe intend to end their carnival in a tableau of sacrifice by leaping fom the top of the old rollercoaster. As their day draws to a close, each is confronted with the choice ­ between a life holding on, or a death letting go. Each path holds its terrors; whatever the choice, their lives will bear the mark forever.
