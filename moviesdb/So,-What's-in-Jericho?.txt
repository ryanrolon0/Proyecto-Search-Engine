So, What's in Jericho?

 Frank and Jes are best friends. Dissatisfied with their lives they stick a pin in a map and head for a town called Jericho to find jobs and start over. They happen upon a homeless hitch hiker who may or may not be a psychic, a psycho, an alien invader or even the devil himself.
