Vaada Raha... I Promise

 After receiving a generous grant from the American Medical Association to find a cure for cancer, Dr. Dyanesh Kripal Chawla, who always gives hope to his patients, proposes to his sweetheart, Pooja, and both arrange to get married soon. While returning home that night, he meets with an accident and wakes up in the East West Hospital paralyzed from the neck down with virtually no chance of recovery. Shattered and devastated, he is in for more trauma and shock when he finds out that Pooja will have nothing to do with him anymore. Upset, bitter and in despair, he loses his will to live, refuses to take medicine nor any treatment, and awaits death.
