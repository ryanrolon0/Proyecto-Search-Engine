 On March 17, 1930, a crowd assembled outside Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary to witness Al Capone's transfer to Chicago, where he would stand trial. Filmmaker Bill Morrison and composer Vijay Iyer worked with a single panning shot, and accompanying soundtrack, to create this 12-minute film on the nature of spectacle.
