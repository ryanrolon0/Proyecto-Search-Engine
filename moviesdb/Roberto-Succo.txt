Roberto Succo

 'Kurt' claims to be a sales rep. He also claims to be English in spite of his heavy Italian accent. Kurt is an habitual liar and a dangerous driver, at the very least. In the south of France he meets LEa, age 16. Between his increasingly strange dates with LEa, Kurt engages in a number of armed robberies, some successful, some not... The police are perplexed by a series of crimes including disappearances and a murder. They conclude that they are dealing with a madman... After he proposes, LEa breaks up with Kurt. The attempt to find a new girlfriend leads to a shooting by Kurt, now calling himself AndrE. LEa's information identifies Kurt/AndrE as Roberto Succo, psychiatric patient and parental murderer. The police hunt for Roberto covers three countries.
