The Great Kandinsky

 The once-reknowned escape-artist and magician, Kandinsky, is now reduced to confounding the staff and inmates of his retirement home. His one regret in life is never mastering an underwater escape. The death of a friend sends him out into the world to track down his old colleagues, particularly the Professor, his old teacher, to master the secret of the escape. But the Professor is an escapologist of no mean order, and Kandinsky has his work cut out for him to wrestle away the secret. Meanwhile, his fellow retirement home inmates prepare for Kandinsky's triumphant return.
