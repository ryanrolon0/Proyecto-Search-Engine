The Seven Kings

 As Civil War erupts within the kingdom of Crestlin, two brothers find themselves in the midst of a rebellion and at odds with each other. Draken is determined to destroy the uprising peasants of the kingdom, while his brother Telus, played by Geoffrey DeMarsh, sympathizes with the revolutionaries' cause. However they are both bound to the command of King Dereus, their surrogate father, a man whose cruelty is fed by his own secret remorse. The two must choose their destinies. But which is the more destructive, to defy the king or to follow? Zachary DeMarsh stars as Cerian, kin to the royal brothers, who after his wife is slain in the raids, swears vengeance on all Keltan peasants, man, woman or child. Jennifer Fitzpatrick plays Helena, the brazen romantic interest of Telus, contrasting the turmoil and ruin taking place all around them. But the two lovers soon learn that nothing escapes the devastation of war.
