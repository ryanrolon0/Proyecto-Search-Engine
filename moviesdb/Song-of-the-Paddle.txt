Song of the Paddle

 The Mason family - father 'Bill Mason (II)' (qv), mother 'Joyce Mason (I)' (qv), daughter 'Becky Mason (I)' (qv) and son 'Paul Mason (XIV)' (qv) - take a canoe and camping trip down a river in northwestern Ontario and along the shores of Lake Superior. This trip is only one of several such the family have done as Bill and Joyce took Becky and Paul on their first canoe experience when they were only infants. The parents want to expose their children to nature in all its good and bad and most importantly to respect it. They assess the more dangerous aspects of the river traverse before deciding to paddle or portage. And once they hit Lake Superior, they are forced to camp until the waves subside. Even then, the trek on the lake is only in areas where Bill is familiar, so that they can take refuge in a cove if the elements turn on them. Along the way, they encounter wildlife, some native rock paintings and spectacular scenery.
