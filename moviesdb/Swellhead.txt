 Baseball player Terry McCall is a very good baseball player, who doesn't mind bragging about his skills on the baseball-diamond and also his off-the-field skills at wooing and winning women. An accident cause his luck to turn bad, and results in him turning blind, but he later regains his sight after being instrumental in saving the life of Mickey Malone, the team's young mascot. He then promises Mary Malone, Mickey's sister, for whose affection he has been competing with a teammate, that he is through showing off and bragging. But, at the end, he is still blowing smoke.
