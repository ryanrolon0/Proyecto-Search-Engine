Rainbow Bridge

 There is not one god. There are many. Three of them, Thor, Loki, and Odin come down from Earth to try and stop the Ragnarok, also known as the apocalypse. Unfortunately, they get caught up in the equally mythical world of high school. They expected monsters, not gym class. In this episode, Thor and Loki have been in high school for a long time, and Odin is fed up. With no leads to the Ragnarok, Odin forces his sons to get more involved with the school, forcing them to join clubs. But what insanity will the gods bring to the Football and Quizbowl team, respectively?
