Watershed

 A watershed is an area constrained by slope and relief, reinforced through the attrition of water and time. In a natural environment sculpted over a duration measured not in years, or even eons, but in scales of geologic time, our existence is only a blink - a moment. Yet in our human moment we have shown the potential to drastically influence our environment, and watershed becomes the descriptor of a galvanizing moment when we decide to understand and protect a place. The Henry's Fork of the Snake River in Idaho is such a place.
