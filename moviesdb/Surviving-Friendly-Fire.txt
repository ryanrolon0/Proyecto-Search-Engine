Surviving Friendly Fire

 In the early 90's seventy youth from a Hollywood homeless shelter started a theatre project encouraging them to tell their stories.. The youth ran the gamut of racial, cultural and sexual identities. Only ten completed the project and became performers. This film documents the process. The resulting play, Friendly Fire, was performed at the prestigious Los Angeles Festival before going on to tour high schools throughout the city.
