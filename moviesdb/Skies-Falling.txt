Skies Falling

 A teen outcast named Elizabeth is caught in the midst of a series of terrible events that apparently only she has the answers to. While being interrogated by a police detective she fades in and out of present time, reliving past events and desperately trying to identify reality. Torn between the belief that she is being controlled by a higher power and the fear that she is losing her mind, Elizabeth struggles to piece together enough information to come to terms with her own moral dilemmas.
