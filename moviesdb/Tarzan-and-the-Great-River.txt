Tarzan and the Great River

 Tarzan is summoned to Brazil by an old friend to stop an evil tribal cult from destroying native villages and enslaving the survivors. The Lord of the Jungle is accompanied on his quest by a pretty blonde doctor, a boy and a grizzled sea captain. In Brazil, Dr. Ann Philips is trying to innoculate the superstitious natives against an epidemic. The murderous leopard cult opposes the intrusion. The natives take heart when the riverboat captain's young helper Pepe volunteers for the first shot.
