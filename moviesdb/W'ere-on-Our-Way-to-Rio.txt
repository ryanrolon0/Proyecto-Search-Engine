W'ere on Our Way to Rio

 Actually, Popeye and Bluto are already there. They visit a nightclub, where the featured singer/dancer is, of course, Olive Oyl. Both of the boys instantly fall for her, but she only has eyes for Popeye. Bluto figures he'll get his revenge by claiming the awkward Popeye is a champion samba dancer. He tries to fake it, and to hide from the spotlight, but no luck, until he breaks out the spinach. Bluto tries various other ways to sabotage his dancing, but the spinach-powered Popeye is too fleet of foot for Bluto to do any harm. In a final twirl with Olive, they end up with their clothes swapped.
