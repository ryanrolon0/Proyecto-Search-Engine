The Pretty Boy Project

 Is this your Mother's love story? No. Not really. Perhaps it's a story of hope? Let's hope not. Is it a story about achieving the impossible? HELL NO! It's a quirky, off centered tale of a nomadic mother and her three metro-sexual street-hustling sons. Welcome to Oakland. Home of hard scowls, hard gangsta rap, and even harder times. Armed with their pretty hair, pretty smiles, and a Pretty last name, Jermaine, Jerome, and Tracy Pretty lure Oakland's most flamboyant thug, and defender of all things "hard", into a duel TO THE DEATH! Okay... maybe it's not to the death, but it's for ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS! And a thousand bucks buys a shit load of beauty products. And we all know how every Pretty Boy needs his beauty products...
