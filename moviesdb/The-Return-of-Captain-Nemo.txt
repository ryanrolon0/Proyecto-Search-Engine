The Return of Captain Nemo

 Two US Navy divers discover the Nautilus trapped underwater, with Captain Nemo in suspended animation inside for the last century. Once Nemo is revived, the government makes a deal with him to refit his ship with a few modern technologies in exchange for his helping to defeat Professor Cunningham, a mad genius threatening to destroy Washington with a missile from his own submarine unless he is paid a billion dollars. Later, Nemo continues and completes his search for the sunken city of Atlantis, delayed 100 years by his long time in stasis.
