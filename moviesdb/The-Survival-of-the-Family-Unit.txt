The Survival of the Family Unit

 'The Survival of the Family Unit' is about a son who is so overwhelmed by his unhappy memories living with an overbearing father that he hatches a plan to murder him by poisoning his father's tea. At first all goes according to plan, but soon the son begins to have second thoughts as he, for the first time, begins to see his father as human being with flaws and weaknesses instead of just an authority figure.
