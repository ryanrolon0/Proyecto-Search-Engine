The Insomniacs

 Bell has insomnia. So one restless night, she decides to go to the local Insomniac's Anonymous 3 a.m. meeting, and there she meets Helena, the girl of her waking dreams. After the meeting, Bell and Helena explore their connection back at Bell's apartment, where they crawl into bed and sleep together as the sun begins to rise.
