Say a Little Prayer

 Seymour is a loner. A small, shy, introverted eleven year old whose parents are separated. By chance Seymour meets the beautiful, effervescent but drug-addicted Angie, who is also lonely and trapped in her own unhappy world. The relationship that develops offers strength to them both and through the highs and lows of a long hot summer they gradually learn to face the truth about each other and themselves.
