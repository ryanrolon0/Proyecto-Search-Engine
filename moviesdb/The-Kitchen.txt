The Kitchen

 The Kitchen is the space in the family home where everyone must pass through on a daily basis. The morning routine provides a constant backdrop against which current tensions and dynamics within the family unit emerge. These tensions are often unspoken, bubbling to the surface through the body language, eye contact, and gestures. In an environment where people know each other intuitively, we respond instinctively to each other's state of being.
