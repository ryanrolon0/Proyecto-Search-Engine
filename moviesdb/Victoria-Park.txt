Victoria Park

 Victoria Park is the story of a group of Italian-Canadian gentlemen who have gathered in Vancouver's Victoria Park to play bocce ball for the past fifty years. These lively and fiercely competitive old-timers are a beloved neighbourhood institution and an important part of the city's living history and culture. Located in what was once considered Vancouver's thriving Little Italy, Victoria Park, and the surrounding Commercial Drive area, is slowly losing its Italian roots as new immigration from Italy all but disappears. As a sign of the times, the park is slated for major re-construction, leaving the aging gentlemen without their familiar gathering place for months and possibly changing their community's landscape forever. The film also follows Rudy and Elsa, an endearing Italian-Canadian couple who are still playing competitive bocce ball well into their 70's. Through their love of the game, they hope to somehow attract the next generation of Italian-Canadians to carry on the bocce tradition. And meet Raymond Culos. Ray is a passionate second-generation Italian-Canadian and local community historian whose quest to retain his cultural traditions has led to him writing four books on the subject and building a traditional bocce court in his own backyard. Join these and a host of other neighbourhood regulars as they help to tell the story of what could be the last generation of Italian-Canadian bocce ball players in Vancouver.
