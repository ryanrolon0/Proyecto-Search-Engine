Stalking Rocco DeLuca

 In 2007 and 2008, Shakefire.com had the exclusive opportunity to follow Rocco DeLuca and the Burden from Atlanta to Los Angeles. We caught him in concert, in studio, acoustic, behind-the-scenes and Rocco even took on the camera work himself. This is an exclusive 18 minute documentary featuring exclusive performances of "Gift" and tracks from his newest CD, "Mercy".
