 Brooklyn, 1988. Crime is rife, especially drugs and drug violence. A Russian thug is building his heroin trade, while everyone laughs at the cops. Brothers have chosen different paths Bert into New York's Finest; he's a rising star. Bobby, who uses his mother's maiden name, manages a club. Bobby too is on the rise new girlfriend and a green-light to develop a Manhattan club. Joe and Bert ask him to help with intelligence gathering; he declines. Then, Joe raids Bobby's club to arrest the Russian. From there, things spiral out of control Bobby's loyalties face the test. During the New York 1984 drugs war, Bobby Grusinsky-Green manages El Caribe, Russian fur magnate Marat Buzhayev's Brooklyn nightclub. Bobby initially refuses when his brother, NYPD coming man Joseph Grusinsky, and their domineering father, Brooklyn commissioner Burt Grusinsky, expect him to be their spy in the club's secluded Russian (mob?) clientele as they suspect Marat's cousin Vadim Nezhinski to be the borough's major drug baron. Still suspicions rise, until the mob murders Joe. Now Bobby is out for personal revenge, even if that means changing his whole life.
