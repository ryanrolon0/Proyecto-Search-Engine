Temporária

 "Temporária" is a diptych consisting of different artistic objects - first, a woman cleaning a theater, then, the rapports between two fictional workers and a tyrannical diva who lives in the theater's attic. Both videos share one theme (the relationship between the individual and work) and focus on the problem of the individual's (in)visibility in the city and how it is affected by the tasks which he performs - being temporary as a way of being, a way of thinking, a way of finding a place. It is understood that this principle rather than an issue of precarious employment, is the ontological condition of our times.
