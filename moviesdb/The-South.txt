The South

 Two high school friends, Qing and Song, plan their escape from the city they're living in. However, Qing backs away from the decision and watches Song head toward their desired destination-a small southern town called Rivadavia. Ten years later, Qing receives a mysterious invitation to a funeral being held in Rivadavia. She musters the courage to head to the town she dared no to go to before. There, buried in the earth, she finds the dreams she was once too afraid to go after.
