The Dalton Gang

 Deputy Marshal Larry West arrives in Rincon to investigate the murders of several ranchers. Blackie Mullet, leader of a gang working for the local land-and-water company, tries to convince Larry that the Indians are responsible for the killings, while Larry's old friend newspaper editor Amos Boling and his assistant Polly Medford tell him they suspect the land company and that Blackie is actually head of the infamous Dalton gang. Sheriff Jeb Marvin locks Larry up after he kills Missouri Ganz in self defense. Friendly Indians, led by Chief Irahu, free Larry and he goes on the trail of Blackie and the gang.
