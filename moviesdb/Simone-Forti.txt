Simone Forti

 An ARTPIX release. In the spring of 1961 Simone Forti presented a program titled Five Dance Constructions and Some Other Things in a concert series organized by her friend, composer La Monte Young, at the New York loft studio of Yoko Ono. These radically new dances created circumstances for the performers' direct, non-stylistic actions. Each of the pieces was performed in a different place in the loft, with the audience moving from location to location to view them. Some of the pieces required elementary structures - a hanging rope, rectangular wooden boxes - which were placed throughout the loft like a sculptural installation. In 2004 the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles invited Forti to re-create these dance constructions at the Geffen Contemporary space, in conjunction with the exhibition A Minimalist Future Art as Object 1958 - 1986. This DVD documents that evening and includes Huddle, Slant Board, Platforms, See Saw, Roller Boxes and Accompaniment for La Monte's 2 sounds and La Monte's 2 sounds. The soundtrack of La Monte Young's 2 Sounds has been re-mastered and the composer's notes accompany the video. In addition, there is a question and answer session with Forti at the conclusion of the performances.
