Special Inspector

 Filmed in Canada as part of the UK-Quota System Evans is given the assignment of running down a smuggling ring which hijacks Canadian fur-shipper's trucks and sells the loot in the United States. He gets a job with the trucking firm that has been hijacked the most by the gang, and is a hijack victim his first night on the road. Several clues lead him to the thieve's trail, but he overplays his cards at the head-office of the fur shippers, and is identified as a Customs Agent. Rita Hayworth would go on and make a couple of films in which she had a little bit more to do than she has in this b-feature programmer.
