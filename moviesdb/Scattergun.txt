Scattergun

 Webb Wilder descends into a southern gothic underworld flush with casino cash, trailer trash, and raw-boned violence to rescue his congenitally misinformed nephew from rural mobsters. A full time roots rocker, part-time private eye, Webb Wilder receives an SOS from his nephew Abner when 'organized thugs' intent on collecting on mounting gambling debts kidnap Abner's girlfriend, Wanda. Accompanying Webb on his rescue mission is record company A & R (Artist and Repertory) man, Pippin Moss; an ethics-challenged entertainment industry manipulator intent on signing Webb to a new contract. Tracking down Abner leads Webb and Pippin to Pineopolis County, Mississippi, a contemporary miasma of roadside fruit stands, dirt track car racing and murky agrarian crime where "good and evil, black and white bleed into gray in a minute and darkness sometimes catches the angels nappin'."
