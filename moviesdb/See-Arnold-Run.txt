See Arnold Run

 This biographical docu-drama alternates between two parallel threads in the life of 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' (qv) repeat winner of the Mr. Olympia body-building championship; and his modern foray into the world of politics, hitting the campaign trail and competing in the frenzied atmosphere that accompanied California's chaotic recall election. This is the biopic about the muscleman who became a Hollywood superstar and then a superstar politician. The film follows Schwarzenegger's campaign for governor of California in the wacky recall election of 2003, looks back at Ah-nold's pursuit of an unprecedented 4th "Mr. Olympia" body building championship three decades ago, and reveals how Schwarzenegger's incredible ambition and personal charisma have brought him to the top..
