Self Help

 For Peter life is simply an act of going through the motions. He keeps an ad on the fridge door as a futile reminder of an age-old ambition, practically forgotten. For Rachel, the loss of someone close continues to adumbrate her life. They arrive at a poorly attended self help seminar, which promises to help them reclaim their 'impact' on life. However, with the rediscovery of a long-lost childhood dream (and a bit of Curtis Mayfield to boot) they soon realize the true meaning of self-help. This award-winning short film was selected into the Palm Springs International Short Film Festival, the Tampere Film Festival, the London Film Festival and the Manhattan Short Film Festival, among several others. It has also been selected as part of PBS' Image Union series and was broadcast on PBS Chicago.
