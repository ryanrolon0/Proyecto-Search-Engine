Terreur cannibale

 Two crooks (Mario and Roberto) kidnap a girl and hide out in the house of a friend who lives by trading with the natives in a nearby jungle. The friend's wife is raped by Mario; she exacts revenge by tying him to a tree and leaving him to the cannibals. She then informs the kidnapped girl's parents of their daughter's whereabouts, and the crooks flee through the jungle.
