Towed in a Hole

 Laurel and Hardy are in the fish business. They drive around town seeing if they can sell any. Stan suggests they catch their own fish and could keep all the profits when selling them to people. Ollie likes the idea so they buy a boat at the junk yard and try, sometimes unsuccessfully, to fix it up. When the boat is finally fixed up, the whole operation goes south.
