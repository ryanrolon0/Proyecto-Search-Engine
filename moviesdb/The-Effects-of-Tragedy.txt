The Effects of Tragedy

 Life is about participation. For Sydney Granger that was one thing she hardly did anymore. After the tragic death of her father as a young girl, Sydney retreated into herself becoming a wallflower; not one classmate noticed. But when her only confidante, a maintenance worker, is transferred and the new guy in school takes a liking to her, she begins to notice the importance of participation. Even when tragedy strikes, our actions and relationships keep us from falling apart.
