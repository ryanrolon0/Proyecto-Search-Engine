 In the safe confines of his apartment, Jonathon Finch, an odd kid who spends more time with his pet canary than other students, is finally able to connect to another introvert, Flora. Jonathon shares stories about his canary with Flora, but one story turns into a nightmarish memory and the two embark on a psychological journey where they struggle to connect through the remaking of their dark pasts and inner fears.
