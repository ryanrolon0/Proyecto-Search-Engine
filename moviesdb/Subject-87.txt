Subject 87

 SUBJECT 87 illustrates a world almost 200 years in the future, however one not too much unlike our own. Mankind had been wiped out by a chemical warfare mishap, and only a group of children had survived. The last five generations have been spent re-learning the technology and ways of the world and society. However, they were able to discover a few new interesting things of their own, such as the means to rebuild and reanimate those that had died before the man-made apocalypse.
