Transatlantic Coffee

 A classic tale of boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl....only the boy, is a 41 year old clown, the girl, an underage stripper from London. Haunted by the memory of a mysterious woman, titillated by the surroundings of 2001 New York City, and enthralled by the emergence of Mandie (Lewis) into his life, Alex (Pinassi) struggles to follow the advice of his best friend, Ronnie (Torres) and more importantly, his heart to yield his desires and do what is seemingly right. Written and directed by Erik Peter Carlson, Transatlantic Coffee is a story of lust, love, loss, yearning, and ultimately confusion amidst a city in the shadows of tragedy.
