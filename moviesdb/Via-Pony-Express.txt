Via Pony Express

 The Government has approved Betty Castelar's Spanish land grant and notification is sent via pony express. Porter is after her ranch and waylay's rider Buck Carson to get the letter. Left to die in the desert, he is saved by Castelar's horse and brought to her ranch. When Porter later arrives, a peculiar mannerism lets Buck identify him as the gang leader and he vows to get the letter back.
