The Fairly OddParents in School's Out! The Musical

 Ten year-old Timmy Turner and his friends are about to enjoy a summer filled with mess, mayhem, and music. But when the adults of Dimmsdale say enough is enough, they turn to Flappy Bob, former clown-turned-lawyer and owner of Flappy Bob's Peppy Happy Learn-A-Torium to help put a stop to the kids' behavior. What the adults -- and Flappy Bob -- don't know is that an evil force has been manipulating everything and everyone behind the scenes for the last thirty-seven years. Can Timmy and his fairy godparents Cosmo & Wanda sing their way through the show and put a stop to the Pixies' evil plans before its too late?
