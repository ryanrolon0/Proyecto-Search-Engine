The Money

 Angel and Sarah rob a bank and make off with a substantial amount of money. Once back at their hideout, Sarah chloroforms her partner and makes off with the dough, leaving her erstwhile friend bound and gagged. When Angel's boyfriend rescues her, the pair set off to re-steal the money and teach Sarah a lesson.
