The Goon and the Gamma Scout

 Asia steps out to a corner in her neighborhood to sell her Gamma Scout cookies. After some successful sales, she is then joined by drug-dealer and pimp, G-No. He sets up shop right across the street from her business which she sees as a threat. She does all she can to run the drug-dealer away until it turns to a full out confrontation.
