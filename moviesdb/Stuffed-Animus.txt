Stuffed Animus

 'Stuffed Animus' is the short story of a much beloved teddy bear at playtime. When Teddy's owner the Boy plays a little too roughly with Teddy, Teddy perceives it as mistreatment and embarks on a path of retaliation, turning against the toys in the nursery. Inspired by Margery William's classic tale "The Velveteen Rabbit."
