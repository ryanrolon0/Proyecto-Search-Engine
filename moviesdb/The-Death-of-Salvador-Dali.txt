The Death of Salvador Dali

 "The Death of Salvador Dali" brings the paranoiac, flamboyant Dali into the office and head-space of an unsuspecting Sigmund Freud. When Salvador seeks Freud's assistance to inject madness into his art, tables are turned, student becomes teacher, and doctor becomes patient. Unwittingly subjected to chaos, deception, and guns, Freud and madness itself become mere ingredients in Dali's grand, secret agenda.
