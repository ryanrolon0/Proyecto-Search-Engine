S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl

 It is the year 2012, 6 years after the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant suffers a second meltdown. It caused an environmental disaster that created bizarre anomalies, mutants and created valuable artifacts. You are a 'stalker' a man who comes to 'The Zone' to make money from the artifact trade, but you lose your memory in a crash on the way to the Zone, and when you wake up you find one message on your PDA - 'Kill Strelok'.
