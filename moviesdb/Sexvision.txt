 Sci-fi writer T.T. Boy and spouse Tonisha Mills are new tenants in a house that turns out to be haunted in all the best ways. T.T. discovers that whatever he writes comes to life before him. He thinks he has harnessed a power, not knowing that he is actually a pawn for the spirited spirits within the walls. As T.T. hammers out fantasies on his typewriter, he conjures up "Neutron Man" to keep his wife busy upstairs. Then he weaves a dream of his own, with two "nymphs from Neptune." T.T. is having a ball ... until he realizes that other forces are at play.
