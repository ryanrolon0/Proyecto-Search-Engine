Rihlat el saada

 Layla, a young Lebanese beauty, arrives in Tunisia, where she is to reclaim an inheritance which will make her a millionaire. Two impresarios, amazed to see that she is the lookalike of Effat Ibrahim, a popular singer who has just decided to give up her career, ask Layla to replace her for a gala night. As she refuses, the two businessmen give Abu Ali, a lady killer, the responsibility of seducing the young lady and persuading her to sing for them. Mission accomplished. But the two young people happen to really fall in love with each other. Whan Abu tells the truth to his beloved, Layla angrily rejects him.
