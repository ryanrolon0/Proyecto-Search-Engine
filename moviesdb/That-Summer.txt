That Summer

 Two girls travel to Torquay in Devon from the North of England to work as chamber maids for the summer. They meet two boys, also in Torquay for the summer, one of whom (winstone) is entered in the "round the bay" swimming race. They have a run in with a gang of Scottish lads, one of whom (morrison) is also entered into the swimming race. Various confrontations ensue with Morrison and his friends framing Winstone for a robbery in a chemists shop. Winstone is arrested just as he is about to start the race. He escapes from the police and follows Morrison into the water, catches him up, forces him to confess to framing him and then goes on to win the race.
