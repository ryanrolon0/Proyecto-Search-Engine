Unspooling Time

 UNSPOOLING TIME posits a form of cinematic storytelling that aligns disparate moments into larger patters of mood and tone. In both image and sound, anecdotal observations intermingle, adhering to a logic that is internal to the film itself. The film is set to selections from LES ANECDOTIQUES (2004), the magnificent final composition of the late French composer Luc Ferrari (1929-2005). The rich soundscape is a masterful aggregation of the found and the invented, seamlessly incorporating field recordings from various corners of Europe and the United States. Likewise, the images in the film are drawn from loosely linked documentary vignettes and unexplained incidents. Both sound and image heighten the sense of the literal passage of time, creating a sense of unresolved tension and drama.
