Tango Bar

 Antonio returns to Argentina from political exile and reunites with his old partner Ricardo at Ricardo's bar. With several talented dancers, the partners stage a cabaret. Ricardo narrates and Antonio sings, taking their audience through the history and meaning of the tango, a dance from the mean streets of the poor. Now that Antonio is back, there is also tension with Ricardo, because both have a history with Elena, and both love her. After the singing, the dancing, and the talking ends, with which man will she want to tango?
