The Judgement Book

 A story of the cattle barons of the past, who endeavored, by the violence of their hired killers, who knew no law other than the six-gun, to ruin the homesteaders who were trying to make a living raising sheep or farming their small land-grants. Steve Harper, who has inherited the newspaper, arrives in Milton to find the town and local countryside under a reign of terror.
