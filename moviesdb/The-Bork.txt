The Bork

 Stan likes things done his way; in fact he insists. Stan is the sadistic task master of a small family group which includes his bible quoting wife Ophy, his one eyed step son Teddy, and his coming of age beautiful step niece, Maddy. Stan learns how to increase the profits of this landscaping business by killing his workers instead of paying them. One at a time, day labors are mysteriously disappearing and the towns' people have a feeling Stan is to blame. For sociopath Stan everything is going fine until one day he unknowingly kills the wrong man. A man who has connections with Satan himself! The last 15 minutes of this suspense/horror movie will have you on the edge of your seat.
