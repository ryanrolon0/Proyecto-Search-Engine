Pudgy Takes a Bow-wow

 Betty leaves Pudgy in her dressing room while she goes to perform her stage show. Her show involves singing a song, then impersonating a Chinese man and an Italian organ grinder. While she's singing, a kitten comes to the dressing room and Pudgy gets out and begins chasing it. They get onto the stage, and in the orchestra pit, and become part of the act, upstaging Betty.
