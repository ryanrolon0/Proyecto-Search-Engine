To Beep or Not to Beep

 Wile E. Coyote hopes to stop and catch the Road Runner using a huge, boulder-throwing catapult. But no matter where Wile E. positions himself, the catapult drops the boulder on him. After the latest in a series of failed attempts to capture the Road Runner (by now, moreso for Coyote pride than dinner), Wile E. Coyote unveils the piece de la resistance of all of contraptions, the most foolproof way ever designed to capture the ever-elusive Road Runner designed to hurl a giant boulder his speedy prey and crush him beneath. Hmmm ... does it work? Well, after six attempts -- some of them comically defying the laws of physics and the last one springing the boulder only after it had apparently been hopelessly jammed -- you know the answer. Oh, by the way, what was the name of the company that designed and manufactured the catapult? Seems as though it was the Road Runner Manufacturing Co.
