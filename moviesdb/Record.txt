Record

 Record is the story of Olive's life in progress, glimpsed through the first tape of her new video camera. She struggles with a bewildering world, and fights to understand her connection to the people around her; all the while unknowingly careening towards her own clarity. She turns to the camera as a portal, through which to view, and be viewed.
