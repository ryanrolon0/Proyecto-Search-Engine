Sybille

 James, a professor in his fifties, shows up one night at the doorstep of an old flame, Manon, whom he has not seen for 25 years. She is not home, and her daughter, Sybille, answers the door. Confused, but drawn to this radiant 15-year old beauty, he enters. Together, they await Manon's return.
