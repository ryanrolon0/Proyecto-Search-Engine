Retrograde Premonition

 This is one short piece in a collection of 15 that will explore representations of consciousness. Retrograde Premonition looks and sounds like floating mind, the vicissitudes of thought, feeling, and the senses. Not limited by the portrayal of actual events, this video works to encourage a roaming consciousness through images and sounds that may or may not be present. Pierce shoots these videos with a digital still camera hand held at long exposures and then weaves the stills into video shots. Each individual image bears the mark of time from motion blur, a blur that may in fact contradict the apparent motion of the frame. He composes the entire sound scape once picture editing is complete.
