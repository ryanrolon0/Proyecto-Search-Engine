The Flirt and the Bandit

 Ione, a Spanish girl, is deemed and recognized among her circle of friends as a heartless flirt. One afternoon, while seated at the edge of a pond in her father's garden, she is startled by the reflection of a face in the water. It is the face of "Bandit Bob" in the woods, where she has just experienced the satisfaction of crushing another heart thrown at her feet. He displays the primitive instinct by carrying her off to his home on the hill, and there making her his wife, while she is still bewildered at having found a personality which expected submission instead of submitting. Later a love-making scene follows, and the story closes with the sheriff and "Bandit Bob" at peace and the little cabin blessed with a baby.
