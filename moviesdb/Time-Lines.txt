Time Lines

 The story of an aging woman who is disgruntled with her wrinkled face...until she looks at her wrinkles from a different perspective. 'Time Lines' was hand-drawn on 8 1/2 x 11 office paper, using a home-made light box, a felt pen and 2 crayons. 2000 pieces of office paper were used in the creation of 'Time Lines'.
