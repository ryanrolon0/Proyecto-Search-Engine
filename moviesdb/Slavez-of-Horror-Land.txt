Slavez of Horror Land

 Slavez of Horror Land is a loosely inspired spoof take on the classic Alice in Wonderland. John Blake works for a fetish magazine who has just granted him his own "Slavez" collomn. His wife Alexia is getting tired of his lifestyle and sick fetishes with adult themed storybook creations. One night she decides to murder him. However, she didn't plan on his creations coming to life. Now Alexia is trapped in a strange world of twisted creatures, and fetish vixens.
