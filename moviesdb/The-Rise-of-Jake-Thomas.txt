The Rise of Jake Thomas

 The town that J.W. (Joe Hammerstone) lives in is in chaos. A group of ex-football players and local felons called the Mob Crew are terrorizing the town. It seems there is no chance to bring them down. The only hope is the mysterious Jake Thomas (Matt Schmitt) and even he doesn't want to be part of this situation. Jake falls in a bind and has to rise up and band everyone together to get out of this mess.
