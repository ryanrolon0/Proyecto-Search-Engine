The Tao of Tom

 Sasha Gordon has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom by the maniacal Von Kruegg - a man with a penchant for the samurai arts. Refusing to pay his demands, Sasha's father decides to hire a mysterious assassin who goes by the name Queen Bee to rescue his daughter - and to teach Von Kruegg a lesson. Unfortunately, Mister Gordon approaches the wrong man, mistaking an average bar customer named Tom for the deadly Queen Bee. Gordon offers eighty thousand dollars for the "Queen Bee's" services - not believing the severity of the situation...Tom quickly agrees. As he prepares for his quest, Tom enlists the help of his friend and preacher, Paul Schwarz as well as Paul's uncle Bert, a former Black Ops leader trained in the deadliest art. Together the three prepare for a rescue mission that will lead Tom to face the evil Von Kruegg.
