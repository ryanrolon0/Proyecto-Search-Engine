The Gangsters

 Patrick O"Neal narrates this 'nostalgic' look back on the "Golden Age of the American Gangster" during the Prohibition Era (1919-1935) featuring such notorious public enemies as John Dilinger, Al Capone, and Ma Barker and her Boys. Archie footage, vintage newsreels, and artists' renderings help recreate the era.
