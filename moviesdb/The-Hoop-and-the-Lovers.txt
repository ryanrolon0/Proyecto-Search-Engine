The Hoop and the Lovers

 A young couple are seen swinging in a hammock, enjoying themselves thoroughly, when their tete-a-tete is interrupted by a small boy and girl who play a joke on the young couple by suddenly throwing a hoop over their heads. While the couple thus caught are struggling to escape, they tip over backward from the hammock, much to the delight of the little folks.
