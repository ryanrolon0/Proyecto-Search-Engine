Unreachable

 The Beautiful Side of Somewhere tells the story of a group of childhood and college friends who are reunited when one of them dies from cancer. Though seemingly distant and different, each of their lives are interwoven together, despite the different paths they have chosen for themselves. During the weekend of the funeral the group comes together one last time, and while some will find resolution to hidden longings and desires, some will have to confront their own inner demons and decide how best to deal with them.
