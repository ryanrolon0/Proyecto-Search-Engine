Slumber Party Slaughterhouse

 In SLUMBER PARTY SLAUGHTERHOUSE their horror movie trivia skills to the test while also helping a recently deceased high school geek take revenge on his former friends. The story follows Paul Tard, a geek on the eve of his high school graduation. Paul's friends are throwing a graduation party with hookers and drugs, but, when they come up one hooker short, Paul is uninvited to the party. Drowning his sorrows in wine stolen from a homeless man, Paul decides to take a bubble bath and bring along his laptop for some internet porn. Of course, the laptop falls in the bathtub and Paul electrocutes himself to death. None of this would have happened if he'd only been invited to the party, so Paul sells his soul to a demon in exchange for the power to take revenge on his former friends. Structurally, SLUMBER PARTY SLAUGHTERHOUSE trivia challenge. Whenever Paul wants to kill one of his friends, the demon asks a horror movie trivia question and the film dissolves to a multiple choice menu. If the audience chooses the correct answer, Paul gets the power to kill his ex-friend (and the friend's hooker, to tie up those pesky loose ends); but the wrong answer will send Paul to hell unavenged. Each "killscene" in the film is written and directed by a different Halo-8 filmmaker and stars actors from Halo-8 films.
