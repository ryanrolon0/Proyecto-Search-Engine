The Modern Buddhist Filmmaker

 Corey Alexander Crowley knows he will 'ultimately end up in a Buddhist monastery, but after a career in Hollywood first.' These two dreams of film and living as a monk intertwine as Corey tries to make it through film school. This short documentary explores the life and mind of a very unique individual; a young, lonely, depressed, mentally and physically challenged filmmaking Buddhist monk in the making.
