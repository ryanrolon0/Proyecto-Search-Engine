Ultra-Violence

 A young girl struggles through a volatile relationship with a drug dealer. Cold and distant, he keeps her attached to him with small, regimented doses of affection that mean everything to her. As the cruel cycle continues, she closes herself off and recoils from those around her, allowing herself only to enjoy his overbearing arms.
