Sagishi ippei

 Ippei and his two partners are professional swindlers, making their livings by conning the gullible and the greedy out of their money. Ippei's plan is to set up a phony investment scam, but he needs a large cash infusion to get started. For this, he turns to his female partner to use her seduction skills on an executive with more money than brains.
