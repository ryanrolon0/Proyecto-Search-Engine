 Over a couple of weeks, four friends in their early thirties reconnect with each other, further define themselves, and continue to make the transition to adulthood. Mike has just been fired from his job as a newspaper reporter and needs a place to stay. John and Carol try to smooth out their up-and-down marriage, while Suzanne looks for Mr. Right.
