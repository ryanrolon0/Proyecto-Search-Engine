 Gia attempts to unionize a nuclear power plant, but the owner's thugs have a list of pro-union workers and are bound, gagged and determined to kidnap the ringleaders and break up the pro-union elements among his workers. In the second segment, Justine is handcuffed, tied to a chair and blindfolded while forced to answer questions during a grueling interrogation.
