Rose's Brew

 When a vain and self conscious Rose moves to a new city and has a little accident that alters her appearance, she swears off the public life forever, until her best friend convinces her to visit a hot jazz club. Drawn to the Saxophone players charming charisma, she falls head over heels. After a short, yet invigorating relationship, he pulls her from her shell and she realizes that there is more to life than looks, there could possibly be love.
