Summon the Sun

 Summon The Sun is a lyrical film that evokes the feelings of transformation which occur when winter becomes spring. Life beckons the sun to assist with its awakening from a deep sleep. When the time is right, the dormant state of winter is broken and life bursts forth into activity. Sounds and images combine to praise and celebrate this moment in the cycle of seasons when the aliveness of the world is most visible.
