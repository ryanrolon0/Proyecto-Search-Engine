U kome je problem?

 This is a twisted play about love, drugs, and high school. Three disturbed musicians at high school bar get involved in a love triangle. Bojan (Bojan Stefanovic) is a womanizing tomboy who is in love with Elena (depressed girl whose family got killed during NATO aggression, played by Elena Tuksar). She is in conflict with slutty Mirjana (Mirjana Sesa), the conductor of the group. Now Mirjana has her eyes on Bojan who falls in love with her. Things get more complicated since all the side characters (including the mentioned trio) are deeply disturbed as well. Everybody is only looking out for themselves, which insures that nothing good can come from this.
