The Bramble Bush

 A handsome and successful young doctor returns to his home town in New England to see his dying friend for one last time. However, his friend wants to die because he is suffering so much from his illness, and he manages to convince the doctor to commit euthanasia (a mercy killing) on him. Haunted by what he has done, and troubled further still by other dark secrets from his past, the doctor seeks comfort in the arms of several of the town's lustful women. This leads to even more complications in his life...
