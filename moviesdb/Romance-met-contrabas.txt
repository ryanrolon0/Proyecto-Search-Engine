Romance met contrabas

 After unexpectedly meeting a princess on the way to a concert, a double bass player (Smytsjkov) completely loses the plot and fails to make it to his destination. The film is inspired by a short story by Chekhov. The accompanying music is performed live on stage by an ensemble of eight musicians that includes renowned bassist Quirijn van Regteren Altena.
