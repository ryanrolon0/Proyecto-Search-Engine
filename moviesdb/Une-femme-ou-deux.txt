Une femme ou deux

 An ad executive (Weaver) impersonates an archeology professor (Westheimer) to avoid a situation with an obsessed former lover. She enlists the help of a hapless archeologist (Depardieu) who is at the airport to pick the real archeology professor (Weaver sees her lover and needs to escape). What follows is a series of conflicting and comical situations involving the "switcheroo."
