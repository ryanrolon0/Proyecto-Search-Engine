The Medium

 Raven James can see ghosts, and one night when he and a friend are walking past the old downtown movie theater, he catches the glimpse of a woman inside the building. This inspires him to investigate the place and see just who is haunting the building. But the owner, Tom Geideman, is very uptight about him nosing around his building. What could Tom be hiding deep down in the caverns of this ancient building. THE MEDIUM is a twisted game of cat and mouse that leads to a tour deep into the bowels of a building and a quarter century old secret... After the tragic death of his wife, a scientist goes on an obsessive quest to make contact with her and bring her spirit back, using a high-tech invention called "THE MEDIUM." Little does he know, that by opening this door he has summoned up a literal Pandora's Box of evil entities, which culminates in a face-to-face confrontation with Death Himself.
