Treadmill

 Twenty-year-old Doug Zackerjazz has been forced to play man-of-the-house ever since his father died when he was younger. Cooking, cleaning, fixing stuff around the house, paying the bills, playing the family chauffeur, and the occasional trip to the store with orders to buy tampons for his uber-controlling mother are what fill up his life. Out of sympathy and a little bit of guilt, Doug has been unable to tear himself away, but a new woman coming into the scene might give him a powerful new incentive.
