The Dirty Dish

 SOUL FOOD meets OPRAH! The DIRTY DISH is a revealing and stimulating look into the lives of fifteen contemporary Black and White women between the ages of 22-50 who as strangers, share their personal experiences on topics such as Skin Color, Employment, Body Image, Abuse, Racism, Families, Media, Rape, Pop Culture and more. The DIRTY DISH centers specifically on Black and White women, who seem to be the closest in peers yet, they also seem to be the most distant from one another, based upon the reality that many Black and White women have a number of fixed ideas about each other. The filmmaker follows conversations between these women through a series of unscripted lunches and dinners, and adds a twist to the experiment at their final get together... SOUL FOOD meets OPRAH!
