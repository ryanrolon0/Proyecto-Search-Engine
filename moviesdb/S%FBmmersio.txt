Sûmmersio

 In Summersîo we meet a young man who is having the day of his life... The weather is perfect, he meets the girl of his dreams, everywhere he goes the birds sings lovely melodies to him. Though some things strike him as odd, he is experiencing a feeling of total relaxation and utter satisfaction. All is as it should be. Or is it?
