The Shadows Company

 An old and lonely man finds an ad in the classifieds and answers it. He goes to the date and rapidly finds himself surrounded by well intentioned members of his family he hadn't seen in a long time. It's only when the party is over that the spectator finds out the "family" was a recruited theatre cast the old man had rented through the ad.
