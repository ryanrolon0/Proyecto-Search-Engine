Survive the Savage Sea

 Jack and Claire Carpenter realize his life-long dream by selling the family farm and uprooting their four kids to buy the yacht Providence. Sons Gary, Brian and Timmy give it an honest try, daughter Susan decides to take a job in a port; her place is taken by Wally Hudson, who wanted a 'lift' to Tahiti and proves a spoiled brat, without the sailing experience he claimed. Shortly after sighting whales, they are hit by a whole group and sink, too fast to think of sending a radio message. Their inflatable raft is very small for six people, supplies for a day or three. To get 1,000 miles further, where sea-traffic is far more likely to find them, dad designs a sail. Everything proves hard, even the rain they desperately longed for, but the boys show great courage. Only after weeks Susan gets a search started.
