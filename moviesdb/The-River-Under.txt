 After 34 years, the filmmaker tries to search for her lineage and discover that she has two brothers who fought for opposite side of the Vietnam War, while one of the oldest sister marries to an American soldier.

With frustration the filmmaker is creating a documentary to explore family division and silence through personal interviews.
