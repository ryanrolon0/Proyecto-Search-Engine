The Farmer's Other Daughter

 Farmer Brown wants to sell his daughter, June, to the dastardly Cyrus P. Barksnapper in order to save his farm. But, Jim Huckleberry would like to to do some plowing with June himself. To help, he applies for financial aid, but the government screws up thinking he requested foreign aid.
