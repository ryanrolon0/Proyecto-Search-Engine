Roaring Guns

 Jarrod Whitney, sent to manage a hydraulic mining operation in 1870's California, becomes concerned for the plight of the farmers whose land is being systematically destroyed by the erosion caused by the mining. Another of the series of two-reel featurettes that Warners made in the early-to-mid-40's utilizing stock footage from their 1935-40 feature length westerns. This one uses stock footage from 1938's "Gold Is Where You Find It" and may actually be an improvement on the original, which is possibly the dullest Western carrying a WB logo from that period, because this version only runs 20 minutes. Staying true to the original, Warners cast Robert Shayne (the 2nd-dullest-leading-man in films) in the role played by George Brent (the 1st-dullest-leading-man in films) in the original feature. Since close to half of "Roaring Guns" is footage taken from "Gold Is Where You Find It", then most of the original crew should be shown on this one as uncredited, especially since the production vales of the first one were the best thing about the film.
