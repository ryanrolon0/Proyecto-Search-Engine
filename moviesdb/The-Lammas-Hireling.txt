The Lammas Hireling

 Ian Duhigs famous narrative poem The Lammas Hireling, deals with superstition in rural Ireland. Although set at the turn of the 19th Century, the poem still has relevance today. A farmer hires a labourer from a hiring fair and starts to become very wealthy very quickly. Little does he know that the hireling is in fact a witch, who changes into a hare at full moon to suckle on the blood of his cattle. He is awoken one night to the screams of the witch who has been caught in a fox trap. Ian Duhig's famous narrative poem The Lammas Hireling, deals with superstition in rural Ireland.
