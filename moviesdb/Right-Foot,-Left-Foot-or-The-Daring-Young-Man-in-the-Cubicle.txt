Right Foot, Left Foot or The Daring Young Man in the Cubicle

 A man in middle management at an insurance company is writing his performance evaluation, which brings on a crisis in identity life he's imagined for himself? Is he happy? Has he made the right choices? He plays scenes out in his mind equally chubby wife; of seeing his son turn into an unruly teen; of facing his younger, hipper, female boss, whom he imagines both threatening him and kissing him. All the while, he's aware of how he may appear to others - ridiculous - and that his wife may be unhappy. He's written a poem; does it hold the key to insight?
