The Angel and Rajapala

 The Angel and Rajapala is the story of Rajapala, a young hunter, who manages to capture and persuade an angel to marry him and stay on earth. Rajapala is a traditional Balinese fairytale and is a warning to any mortal who would attempt to control the divine for his or her own purposes. Rajapala and all its variations, like many fairy tales, are slowly being forgotten. Growing up in Bali, these fairy tales were the bedtime stories of our childhoods. Recently we returned to the women who told us these stories and asked that they tell them to us again. Unfortunately, we discovered that the storytellers themselves had forgotten. Bit by bit, with encouragement, the details returned and we heard the tales in all their glory. Narrated in Balinese, as it was told to us originally, the film is an effort to record the story of Rajapala and the voices of the storytellers before they disappear.
