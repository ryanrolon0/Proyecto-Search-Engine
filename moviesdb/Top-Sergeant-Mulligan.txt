Top Sergeant Mulligan

 Deadbeats Pat Dolan and Budd Doolittle are being harassed around the clock by Herman Mulligan, a no-excuses-accepted bill collector who has little use for people who don't pay their bills. In order to escape Mulligan, the two enlist in the army. Their good plan turns to bad results when they arrive at boot camp and meet the platoon's Top Sergeant...Herman Mulligan, who is standing next to the paymaster when they get their "21 Dollars a Day-Once a Month" earnings, and never runs short of providing them guard-duty and kitchen-police assignments.
