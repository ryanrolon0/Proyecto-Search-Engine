Reindeer Games

 After being imprisoned for six years on a grand theft auto charge, Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) and his cellmate Nick (James Frain) are finally going to be paroled. After hearing endless stories during his incarceration of Nick's romantic correspondence to a woman named Ashley he has never met (Charlize Theron), Rudy is looking forward to returning to his family and having a fresh cup of hot chocolate. When Nick is killed during a prison riot, Rudy decides to assume Nick's identity upon release from prison and meet up with the unknown woman. Burdened with a base knowledge of Nick's Indian casino employment past, Rudy finds himself in too deep with Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and is violently forced to cooperate with a casino robbery that Gabriel and his gang have been planning with Nick in mind. Rudy Duncan is a reformed car thief who's just a day away from being released from prison. His cellmate and best friend, Nick is on the way out with Rudy, whom he constantly brags about the female penpal he's constantly been writing to. But in an unlikely turn of events, Nick ends up out of the picture, and Rudy stupidly assumes Nick's identity and ends up spending time with Ashley, Nick's penpal after he's released. But Ashley's brutal sibling Gabriel and his crew of thugs knew Nick used to work for a casino. And now Rudy must keep his identity as Nick to save his life, but must reluctantly aid Gabriel and his thugs to rob the casino. But things aren't what they appear to seem.
