Triple Exposure

 'A strongly atmospheric piece of film noir and an impressive debut short.' Working Title films Patrick Mower (The Devil Rides Out, Emmerdale) stars in a story of revenge and murder set in the shadowy world of the 1940's photographic industry. Inspired by film noir classics such as 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Big Sleep'.
