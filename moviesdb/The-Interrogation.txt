The Interrogation

 What you don't know, the unknown, can be the greatest weapon to break you down, and the greatest shield to give you hope. Accused of harboring terrorists in Kabul, Afghanistan, Zachariah Al-Khatani, is at the whim of interrogator extraordinaire Mr. Dakota. Torture, role playing, even candy, all Dakota considers to break down his victims. When approaching Zachariah, he does like any other with pen, paper, and a smile. However, by the end the psychological effect of his alternative style on Zachariah seems to take a toll to large to remedy.
