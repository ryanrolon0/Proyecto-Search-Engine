Reverie Three

 Foster has known nothing of family. For seven years, he has called an orphanage home, social workers parents, and other discarded children brothers and sisters. They are eventually replaced by Hanley and Irene Wortzik, a husband and wife incapable of having children. For Foster, the dream of a family to call his own finally came true, a dream that lasted until the miraculous birth of Owen Wortzik.
