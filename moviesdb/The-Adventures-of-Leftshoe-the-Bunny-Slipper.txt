The Adventures of Leftshoe the Bunny Slipper

 The story of one slipper's search for meaning and companionship after the tragedy of losing her 'sole mate'. Along the way she meets a host of new friends, from evangelical followers of 'Jesus Christ, Sandal', and a pack of wolves, to scrappy homeless shoes, just trying to tie themselves together. 'Leftshoe' is a story filled with foot-loose characters and laced with irony and wit.
