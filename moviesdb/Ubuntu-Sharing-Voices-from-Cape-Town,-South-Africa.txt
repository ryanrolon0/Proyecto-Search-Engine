Ubuntu Sharing Voices from Cape Town, South Africa

 Recent films like Waiting for Superman and Race to Nowhere are indicative of the public concern for the US educational system. Parents and politicians are worried about the education their students receive in public schools. They ask whether US schools are providing the quality education the learners need to keep this country strong and competitive in a global society. In her classroom, filmmaker and teacher Judith Blake sees students both motivated and dulled by the educational system. Blake wondered if learners half way around the world are like her students. With a grant from Fund for Teachers, Blake traveled to Cape Town, South Africa in search of answers.
