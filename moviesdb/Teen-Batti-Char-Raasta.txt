Teen Batti Char Raasta

 Punjabi Lala Gulabchand marries a woman from Uttar Pradesh. They give birth to five sons. When the sons grow up, they marry a Sindhi, Maratha, Bengali, and Gujerati girls, while the fifth one, Suresh, is unmarried. Suresh is attracted to the melodious voice of a radio singer by the name of Kokila, and has drawn the portrait of a beautiful woman who matches her voice in every respect and manner. Little does Suresh know that Kokila is really a very plain-looking young woman, who he has already met, in the shape and form of his family's maidservant, Shyama, who he has never looked at twice.
