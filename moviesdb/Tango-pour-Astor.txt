Tango pour Astor

 A vivid tribute to the revolutionary master of the tango, from his friend and disciple Richard Galliano. An explicit, elaborate homage, perfect and enthusiastic. It's not only the memory of Piazzolla that vibrates in every breath of the bandoneon, but our own memories, our own emotions.
