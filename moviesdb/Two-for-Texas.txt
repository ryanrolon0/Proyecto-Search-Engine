Two for Texas

 In 1836, two prisoners escape from a Louisiana chain gang run by a vicious strong boss. In the process of the escape, the strong boss is killed which sets his brother, the ex-warden on a chase of the men. However, the two join up with Sam Houston's army to fight the Mexicans which also sets them free from previous charges. The ex-warden then sells guns to the Mexicans which leads to the Alamo massacre and the death of their friend, Jim Bowie. The two then lead the avenging charge at San Jacinto that settles the war.
