The Lone Rider Ambushed

 The Lone Rider Tom assumes a former outlaw's identity (Keno) to learn where the gold from his last big heist is hidden. He tries to get the info from Blackie Dawson, but Blackie gets suspicious. Tom Cameron, The Lone Rider is an exact double for the just-released outlaw, Keno Harris, who was responsible for a $100,000 robbery, in which the money was never recovered. Tom has the Sheriff re-jail Keno on a trumped-up charge, while he joins up with Keno's old gang in the hopes they will lead him to the money, but his plan has a couple of flaws; none of the gang knows where the money is and now expect the just-arrived "Keno" to lead them to it for their split; and Keno's girl, Linda, begins to grow suspicious of Cameron, as he is nowhere near as "friendly" as Keno used to be, and Linda is clearly a girl willing to be "friendly." Plus, this Keno can sing, which Keno couldn't do before he went to jail. Clearly, a situation the poet Burns had in mind when musing about mice and men. Then, the real Keno shows up and complicates things a bit, especially when he and Tom "swap" places to the extent that the gang eventually - it's complicated - get after the real Keno, thinking he is the fake Keno.
