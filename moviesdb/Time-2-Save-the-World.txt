Time 2 Save the World

 A stressed out single dad is forced to take calls as his daughter prepares for school before rushing her out the door with barely a kiss or a goodbye or any show of affection. However he cannot remain on the periphery of his daughter's life for very long when her two 'imaginary' friends take him to deserted woodland to do battle with a mysterious world threatening force.
