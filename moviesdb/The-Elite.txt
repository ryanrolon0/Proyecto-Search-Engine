The Elite

 Five kids survive a airplane terrorist attack. They are trained from childhood to become an elite team of anti-terrorist fighters. When they are assigned to find out what happened to a batch of chemical-containing land-mines they find themselves facing the same men that brought down the flight which killed their parents. The fight becomes personal and they disobey orders to stop a missile launch against a computer convention crowd in Athens. They board a hijacked war ship and, retaining minimal wounds, prevent the attack.
