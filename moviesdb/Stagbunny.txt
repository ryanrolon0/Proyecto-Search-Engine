Stagbunny

 Neurotic documentarian and cryptozoologist Garvis Thurston (Howe) sets out to find Wyoming?s elusive Jackalope. He calls together Noel Bowie (Anderson) and Logan Scottsdale (Miller), a pair of recent film grads. While on the search for the Jackalope, they encounter hunting guide Clinton Hughes (Bryson), a ghost hunter named Tre (Stellingwerf), and a slew of characters with their own take on the dangerous beast. All Garvis wants is to find a Jackalope, Tre wants a cappuccino without foam, Noel wants Garvis to quit calling her David, Clinton wants Noel, and Logan wants a hug. Stagbunny explores the legend of the Jackalope with reckless abandon. With heart-pounding action, non-stop excitement, and more electrifying action, view the adrenaline-powered endorphin-releasing motion picture event that Ebert never bothered to see.
