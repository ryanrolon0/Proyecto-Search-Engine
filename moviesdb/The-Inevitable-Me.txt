The Inevitable Me

 Based on real events, the stories the troubled life of one-time successful, now homeless, dramatist Hamish Ian (introducing Choggys West), as he struggles to live in peace with the chaotic, unrecognizable world that surrounds him. Unable, or unwilling, to address his clinically-diagnosed mental illness (Dissociative Disorder), Hamish is forced to accept the world around him only in the spirit of good faith, though is no longer able to make sense of the basic day-to-day, or discern the faces of those that claim to know him. As his condition worsens, reality and fantasy assume a near superposable nature. When one morning, he wakes up to the sudden conviction that, somewhere, a forgotten wife and family await him, hope re-emerges, and a relentless journey of self-discovery begins, which ultimately leads Hamish, however painfully, to confront the truth of his past.
