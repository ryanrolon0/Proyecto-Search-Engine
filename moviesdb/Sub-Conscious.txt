Sub Conscious

 Clocks show time moving quickly. A man, looking somewhat bewildered, drives a city street. Someone stares at him. He finds himself in dark places. A phone rings, he answers it, a woman's voice reassures him. He's chased down stairs in an anonymous old hotel. In a bedroom, an alarm clock goes off, waking a woman sleeping next to him; he's staring at the ceiling. Disorientations continue. Where is reality?
