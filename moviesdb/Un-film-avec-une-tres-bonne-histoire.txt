Un film avec une tres bonne histoire

 Two bunglers introduce themselves in the shooting of a horror movie, pretending to be members of the film crew; they try to create an horrific imaginary world to scare the others to death. The make-up artist of this show spots them and will force them in a journey they will never forget (and might not get alive from).
