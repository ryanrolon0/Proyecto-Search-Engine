The Mortal Storm

 The Roth family lead a quiet life in a small village in the German Alps during the early 1930's. When the Nazi's come to power, the family is divided and Martin Brietner, a family friend is caught up in the turmoil. University professor Victor Roth leads a contented life with family and friends in the south German Alps of 1933. This changes quickly and dramatically once Adolf Hitler comes to power. Most of the town embraces the new creed while a few friends such as Martin Breitner do not. Victor himself is "non-Aryan" and his two step-sons soon leave his house, while his loyal daughter Freya breaks her engagement from Nazi-inclined Fritz. Against increasing difficulties an attachment between Freya and Martin starts to grow.
