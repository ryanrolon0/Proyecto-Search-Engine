Tom Sawyer Aeronaut

 Years before the Wright Brothers achieved controlled flight, Mark Twain wrote a Jules Verne type short story called "Tom Sawyer, Aeronaut." It was strange tale of two of literature's best know trouble making best friends -- Tom and Huck -- making their way around the world on a small airship that could move under its own power, as well as using an early concept of the "Jet Stream." From the story by Mark Twain Missouri, 1850. Out of the sky soars the mad PROFESSOR PARSONS in his experimental airship. TOM SAWYER climbs aboard eagerly, HUCK FINN and his pal freed slave JIM end up reluctant passengers. Parson's on the run from creditors and the law. His insane plan is a non-stop flight across the Atlantic. Pistols cocked, he offers his guests a choice - join him or jump! Over New York City, they hit a terrifying electrical storm. In a blinding lightening flash, the Professor is blown into the night. Our heroes are alone in the dark sky. Their wild flight leads to Morocco, where the boys outrun a pride of lions...the sands of the Sahara, where Huck rescues AICHA, a young Arab princess...on to the Great Pyramid, where Tom outwits Tomb Robbers and saves the lost treasures of Pharaoh. They head East, toward the dawn. Next stop...India? China?
