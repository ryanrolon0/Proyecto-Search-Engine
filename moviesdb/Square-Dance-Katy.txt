Square Dance Katy

 Bob Carson, a talent-scout for a soap-company that sponsors a television program, and his entertainer-friend, Vicky Doran, go hunting for television talent in a rural community, and are met by Katy O'Connor, who wants her boyfriend, Dodo Dixon, and his hillbilly band to break into television. Bob is more impressed with Katy's singing, however, and brings her to New York to star in the company's show. There, she finds a job for Dodo in a Greenwich Village nightclub. Katy becomes successful but Dodo bombs, and thinks he can do better if he gives a big concert, bombs again and gets bad reviews. Can he make it big on the New Jersey seashore?. Maybe.
