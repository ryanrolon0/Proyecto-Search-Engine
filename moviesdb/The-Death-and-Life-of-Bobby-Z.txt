The Death and Life of Bobby Z

 A DEA agent provides former Marine Tim Kearney with a way out of his prison sentence hostage switch with a crime lord. When the negotiations go awry, Kearney flees, with Z's son in tow. Tim Kearney is an incarcerated former Marine who is offered freedom by DEA agent Tad Gruzsa in exchange for impersonating recently-late drug lord Bobby Z. Things don't go as planned, however, and Kearney ends up on the run with Bobby Z's 12-year-old son.
