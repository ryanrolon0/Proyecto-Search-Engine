The Educated Chimpanzee

 This chimpanzee was brought here from Western Africa, and is the most manlike animal in the ape family. In disposition it is lively and intelligent, and has always been considered as the missing link. The picture starts in with the Chimpanzee ringing a call bell for something to eat, and then in the act of eating, next changing to an Irishman smoking a pipe, then taking a drink from a bottle, after which Carrie Nation and her little hatchet is portrayed to perfection; he then represents an Irish sport, and is without doubt one of the most expert typewriters in the country. He then takes a turn at reading, and takes the part of a judge, with a wise look that would do credit to a person who has held that position for a quarter of a century, and ends his little exhibition by representing Paderewski to perfection. A gem of photography and action.
