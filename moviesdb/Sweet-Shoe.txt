Sweet Shoe

 Dona Drake (as Rita Rio) and her all-girl band work in a ritzy setting, and perform some hot melodies, with Rita singing and dancing. Several feature acts are introduced; the first---The Four Norsemen---is a singing male quartet. Then come the Four Specs, a colored aggregation who do some amazing stepping. The finales has Rita in combination with Anita Jacobi, an acrobatic tap dancer.
