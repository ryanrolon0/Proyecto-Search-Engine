Tough Business

 Norah Addison has just been elected mayor of Chicago. She has won an overwhelming victory on a reform platform, promising the voters a cleanup of crime and corruption; funding for schools and improving the city. Less than 2 years ago she met and married Victor Charles, a very successful and well-respected businessman. He is also a very loving partner to Norah and an adoring father to Norah's 13-year-old daughter, whose father was killed in Iraq. Soon after the election Victor begins to reveal a side Norah did not know. When bidding starts on several different construction contracts, Victor insists that Norah manipulates the offer of some high bidders. Norah protests what makes Victor reveal that she must repay the supporters who contributed to her election. Norah is horrified. This surely goes against all her principles and the promises she made to the citizens. Norah standing up for her principles pushes Victor into a rage of craziness. Norah investigates. She discovers that he is the boss of all the organized crime in the city! She finds that the sickness she promised to cure as mayor is living in her house and sleeping in her own bed.
