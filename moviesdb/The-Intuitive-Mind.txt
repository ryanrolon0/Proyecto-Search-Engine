The Intuitive Mind

 The Intuitive Mind takes you on a journey through the belly of the mundane advertising machine. Ideas are rejected because they are processed rather than fostered. It is via a bold move that the system is halted and the creative no longer suffers. The artists are brought together to celebrate the creative experience.
