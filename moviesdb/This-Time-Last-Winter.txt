This Time Last Winter

 A young woman cannot remember a violent incident she recently suffered. When her mother tells her it was inflicted by Iona's indie rock musician boyfriend, Wes, Iona refuses to believe it. To find out for herself, Iona returns to the location of her last memory, his funky warehouse apartment. Through interracial relationships and the healing potential of a talking circle, the film explores violence in young relationships and the moment of choice we face when the urge to be violent surfaces.
