The Journalist and the Jihadi

 A documentary look at the life and kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl - "Danny" to his family, friends, and colleagues. Through interviews and home movies, a portrait of a talented young man emerges - a musician, a recently married husband about to become a father, and a tough-minded investigative journalist. One of his kidnappers, Omar Sheikh, is also profiled by the desire to embarrass Pakistan's president, who was cooperating with the United States in the aftermath of 9/11. We visit the cafE in Karachi where Pearl was kidnapped. We see the site of his assassination. Loss colors all.
