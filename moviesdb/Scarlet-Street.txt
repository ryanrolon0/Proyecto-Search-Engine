Scarlet Street

 Chris Cross, 25 years a cashier, has a gold watch and little else. That rainy night, he rescues delectable Kitty from her abusive boyfriend Johnny. Smitten, amateur painter Chris lets Kitty think he's a wealthy artist. At Johnny's urging, she lets Chris establish her in an apartment (with his shrewish wife's money). There, Chris paints masterpieces; but Johnny sells them under Kitty's name, with disastrous and ironic results. Chris Cross is a mousy, but trusted bank teller married to a relentless nag. His only joy is the painting he does on weekends - until he accidentally meets beautiful "Kitty". Her boyfriend Johnny convinces her to take him for everything he's got when they mistakenly believe that he is a rich and successful artist. In order to keep her in the style to which she is rapidly becoming accustomed he has to come up with ways to put his hands on ever larger amounts of money. But no matter what he does, it's not enough for Kitty and Johnny, who keep pushing until even they are in over their heads. In New York, Christopher Cross is celebrating his twenty-fifth years as a cashier of a company where he receives a golden watch at a dinner party. A middle-aged amateurish painter, Christopher, protects a young woman, Katharine March, from an assault on the street by a young man, Johnny Prince, without knowing that he is her lover. Chris invites Kitty for a drink at a bar, and presents himself as a successful and wealthy painter. The small time crook, Johnny, sees the chance to raise easy money and convinces the manipulative Kitty to take as much money as possible from Chris. He embezzles his company and steals his wife, and Kitty moves to a huge studio. Chris brings his paintings to the new address, and Johnny takes them for evaluation. He finds out they are considered masterpieces by an arts critic and by the owner of a gallery. Kitty pretends to be the painter, becomes famous, and leads them to a tragic conclusion.
