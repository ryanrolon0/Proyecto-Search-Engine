Tischtennis

 A table tennis ball hit with a racket can reach a speed up to 105 mph. For a single stroke a player has a reaction time from 0.07 to 0.25 seconds only. Two international top-class contestants, Stellan Bengtsson of Sweden (winner of three world titles) and Peter Stellwag of West Germany (winner of four West German men's singles titles) demonstrate an exciting game of table tennis played to perfection. Overcoming the referential quality by organizing movements, the film not only reveals the fascinating speed of the game, but also its suspense and its aesthetic beauty. The filming was done with eight cameras simultaneously, and there is high-speed footage with rates up to 5,000 pictures per second.
