That Marino Thing

 Two made mafioso of the gang of Carmine talk their problems with eachother out a the shrink. Vincent despises Paul because he is always late and because he dislikes his endive salad, always prepared with loving care. Paul has a big problem with Vincent, because he whacked his childhood menace Marino early, without having the chance to severely torture. The two are enemies for life it seems, but the psychiatrist knows her trade.
