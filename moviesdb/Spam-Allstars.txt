Spam Allstars

 Spam Allstars originators of the 'Miami Sound', a unique band which blends improvisational electronic elements and turntables with latin, funk, hip hop and dub. It attracts many types of people. But as they look out and see people dancing salsa, next to break-dancers, and festival-goers driving for hours to catch a show; they know something very special is going on.
