Removal Notes

 Two high school students, Terry and Robert, causally talk about life, personal views on humankind, and bullies after they had just attacked their school with automatic weapons. Now the school belongs to the gunmen as they hide out and periodically roam the school in search of more students. The few survivors left in the school; mainly three female students and one male student hide out in the ravaged classrooms hoping to devise a way to get out of the school alive.
