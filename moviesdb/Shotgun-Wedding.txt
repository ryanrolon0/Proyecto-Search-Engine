Shotgun Wedding

 After her latest hit goes south, leaving a child orphaned, hired-gun JESSE decides she's had it with the whole bloody business. Trouble is her boss, ruthless East Indian gangster, PATEL, wants her to keep pluggin' away. So does her trigger-happy, jacked-up Irish partner, RAY, who embraces the lifestyle with way too much enthusiasm. Making matters worse, Jesse's longtime lover - dancer MICKI FINN - shares Ray's fixation with firearms. She's fetishized the firepower, taken it into the bedroom, and even incorporated it into her burlesque act - a wild stage show in which she rescues a young girl by pistol-whipping thugs and firing into the audience! When a pumped-up Micki offers to take on gun-shy Jesse's final hit, all goes south. Now, Jesse and Micki are on the run to San Fran, unaware that a bleeding target, his crazed nephew and an emotionally-torn ex-partner/lover are all speeding toward them, guns drawn, ready to rain a hail of bullets all over Jesse & Micki's war-torn Wedding!
