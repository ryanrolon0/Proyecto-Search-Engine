The Jumper

 There are moments in life where you feel stuck, backed up, no way out. This is where Jumper, a dark comedy about a wannabe suicide jumper, comes along. With ruthless bluntness the film shows the painfully unsuccessful attempts transforming the seriousness of the situation into a mere comedic adventure.
