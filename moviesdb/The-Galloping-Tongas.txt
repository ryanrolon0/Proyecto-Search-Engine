The Galloping Tongas

 In the absence of a railway there is no way of reaching the capital of Cashmere, India except by a system of mail carts which travel over the highway at a gallop. These are drawn by sturdy ponies at full speed and are changed at every three or four miles of the trip. The journey is one of the wildest, most exciting and dramatic in the world and this film is a splendid picture of it. This is the kind of picture in which the untraveled public will take the greatest delight.
