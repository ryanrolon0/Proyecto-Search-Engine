Simple Extraction

 Just another typical day in the office for two scientists, SIMPLE EXTRACTION is a music video done in an emerging new style called "instrumental video". With an instrumental video, every instrument, every note, and every tiny nuance of the music is represented visually. Different animations for each of instruments are shown as the sound is being generating creating a one-to-one mapping of everything happening visually with everything happening musically.
