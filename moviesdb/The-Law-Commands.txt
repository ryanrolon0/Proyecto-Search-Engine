The Law Commands

 Night riders are terrorizing homesteaders, and the town doctor tries to keep the locals from forming a vigilante group. After more towns people are killed, however, the rest of the town makes the doctor the town sheriff and tells him to clean up the gang. It's 1862 in Johnson County, Iowa and the Homestead Act is about to be passed. Abbott plans to own the entire County and has his men driving the farmers away. To fight Dr. Kenton's Association which intends to settle matters legally, he has an Association leader murdered. The irate farmers wanting action then join his protective Association and unknowingly sigh their farms over to him. Kenton returns from the state Capitol with a Judge and again legally seeks justice.
