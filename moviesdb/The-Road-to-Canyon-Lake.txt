The Road to Canyon Lake

 When Roach, promises the Italian Mafia a pair of stolen computer chips, the only thing that he forgot was that they originally belonged to the Russian Mafia. After Roach hides the chips in the trunk of his friends car, the chase is on to get them back. A chase that involves not only the Mafia, but also a pair of wacky bounty hunters, an escaped convict, and a 'little white rapper.'
