Victor Nobel

 The short film "Victor Nobel" with the length of 22 minutes, tells the story of Victor Nobel, a young man against his thirties. Because he's unable to make any choice in life, he decides to stay in bed. A total apathy has made control over him. Nobel chooses his dreamworld before his daily reality. He takes himself further and further in an impossible position and gets a feeling of guilt over his laziness. He ignores all influences from the outside. When his telephone rings, he covers it with pillows. He is a dreamer, endlessly escaping from daily business. Rediscovering reality is a central point in this film. The main character is dwelling off so far that his dreamworld becomes his reality. Eventualy his indifference and pent-up feelings breaks loose into tears. Realising that every second that ticks is an utter new and unique experience, he learns just like a child to watch with astonishment at his own environment. The agony he is experiencing in daily life is replaced by a new view in the art of living.
