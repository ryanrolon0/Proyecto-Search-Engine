The Rusty Bucket Kids

 Grandpa Peakssen, owner of The Rusty Bucket store, shares a very special gift with Roxanna and John Coleman through time on a magic steam train! The Conductor guides them as they travel to Gentryville, Indiana in 1824, where they meet Abraham Lincoln, a 15-year-old boy who loves books and wants to go to school. Back at home in Peak City, the police chief is out of town, so Town Manager Nate Weever and his foster son, Miles, keep an eye on Carlina and Rodolfo, two mysterious strangers who have come to steal the secrets!
