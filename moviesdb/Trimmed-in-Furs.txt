Trimmed in Furs

 Bill's wife insists that he get her a fur coat, and since he cannot afford to buy one, he goes on a hunting trip, hoping to capture some furs himself. Meanwhile, a temperamental actress, needing a rest for her nerves, has made plans to visit the same hunting lodge where Bill will be staying. They and several others meet at the lodge, resulting in chaos and confusion.
