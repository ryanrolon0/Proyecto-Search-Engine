The Lost Scenes of Julie Van Buren & Other Tales

 Four bondage vignettes from the Harmony archives. In the first, Julie Van Buren reminisces about bondage scenes from her TV movies which wound up on the cutting room floor. In the second, a buxom brunette is victimized by a burglar; in compensation for the loss of her goodies, she demands that he grant her fantasy - to leave her tightly bound and gagged. In the third, government agents borrow a beautiful redhead's apartment for a stakeout; when she won't stop pestering them, the men are forced to tie and muzzle her. In the fourth, a victimized game-show contestant kidnaps the show's hostess and forces the show's host to play a different kind of game in order to rescue his chair-tied partner.
