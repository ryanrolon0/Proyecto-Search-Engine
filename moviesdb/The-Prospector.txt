The Prospector

 The year is 1850... A gold prospector, seeking his fortune, finds more than he bargained for when he befriends a stranded woman on his journey through the California Sierras. When their water supply dwindles to almost nothing, he discovers he can perform an extraordinary act that will permit the woman he's met by chance to reach her baby and husband.
