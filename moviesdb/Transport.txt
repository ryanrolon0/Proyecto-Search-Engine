Transport

 TRANSPORT posits public transport as a third space, a space that is neither home nor work, via a series of very short narrative video clips of stories that happened on public transport - "found" stories that happened to us, or stories we witnessed - illuminating the quick insight that people have into each other when they travel or wait together. The stories tell of encounters on trains, streetcars, or buses, aiming to make public transport romantic and give it a grunge glamor does not happen in your car! The video-clips are delivered on interactive screens that literally put the viewer into the picture, and are made available for broadcasts and pod-casts. All video clips will be available on the project web-site.
