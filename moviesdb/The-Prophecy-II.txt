The Prophecy II

 Gabriel returns to Earth to prevent the birth of a child conceived by one of his kind (the Angel Daniel) and one of God's "monkeys" (a human woman - Valerie). The coming of this child has been prophecised by a monk, Thomas. When the Angel Daniel kills members of Gabriel's army of angels, Gabriel instead employs the assistance of a teenage girl (Izzy) who has just committed suicide. Gabriel keeps her alive to assist him in his war against Daniel and the other angels which climaxes in a battle in Eden.
