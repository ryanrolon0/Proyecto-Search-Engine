Tenshi no rakuen

 Takachi, a young porno star from a small town in Japan is found dead. His death provides the opportunity to show us his true emotions, and how his two best friends in Tokyo remember him. These two travel back to Takachi's town, Kochi, which Takachi himself had visited just prior to dying. In Kochi, all boys seem to be angels.
