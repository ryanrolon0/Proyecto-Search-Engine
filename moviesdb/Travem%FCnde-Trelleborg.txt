Travemünde Trelleborg

 David is a drummer supported by unemployment benefit, disappointed that life didn't turn out the way he planned. Now he's on the night ferry from Germany with three thousand ecstasy tablets taped onto his torso. The plan is to sell the pills in Sweden in order to get enough money to start all over somewhere else. But when David meets his first love Sara in the all you can eat buffet, he starts to question the course his life is taking.
