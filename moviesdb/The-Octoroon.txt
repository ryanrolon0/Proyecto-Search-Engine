The Octoroon

 In the period before the Civil War, a young man returns to his hometown of New Orleans after having been gone for a long time. He soon meets and falls in love with an "octoroon", a young woman who is one-eighth black. However, since the "one-drop" laws--anyone having as little as one drop of "Negro" blood in them is still considered black, and therefore subject to be sold as a slave--are still in effect, the girl is sold at auction and purchased by an evil and murderous overseer. The young man sets out to free his love from the clutches of the evil slaver.
