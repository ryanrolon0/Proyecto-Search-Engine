Tesoro mío

 Based on a true crime, "Treasure of Mine" follows a week in the life of Carlos Dietrich, a dark bank officer for the past 22 years at the Bank of Argentina. At 40, Dietrich faces an end to his illusions at all levels emotionally, with his wife and lover, professionally (stagnant), personally (unfulfilled) and financially. He places himself on the fence between his daily life and the limits of the law, challenging his status quo, in order to finally attain his dreams.
