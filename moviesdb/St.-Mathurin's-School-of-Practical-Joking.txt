St. Mathurin's School of Practical Joking

 Monty Python meets Roald Dahl in this short comic film set in a school where pranks are not only allowed, they're on the curriculum. Pupils attend classes in the art of peashooting, learn about the chemistry of the stink bomb and conduct experiments on the correct use of the whoopee cushion. Unfortunately, young Stanley Robertson's practical jokes aren't up to school standards. However, when a humourless government official, Ms. McManners, arrives at the riotous school intent on closing it down, young Stanley gets the opportunity to prove himself and Ms. McManners gets more than she bargained for.
