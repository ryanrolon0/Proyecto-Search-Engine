Razor Wire Rodeo

 June 16th, 1995, Jerry Brown killed for a small bag of marijuana. He was sentenced to life in prison and sent to Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, America's most infamous and largest maximum-security prison. 5000 prisoners, mostly African Americans, are serving their time there. Most of them won't ever get out. Jerry Brown is the star of a brutal and unique rodeo call it. The participants are volunteers but are not allowed to train. This spectacular event allows them to make some money and earn a few seconds of fame in front of 10,000 spectators. For Burl Cain, Angola's warden, it is the occasion to make large profits and to develop with impunity his religious programs. By training certain prisoners to become missionaries, he wants to spread religion throughout the prison. Razor Wire Rodeo is the story of Jerry and these thousands of inmates, whose lives have been defined by violence in the poorest neighborhoods. In the arena, the fight against the bull becomes symbolic crushing legal system. In 1995, Jerry Brown, 18, was sentenced to life without parole for murder at Angola (Louisiana), America's most infamous maximum-security prison. He is now the star of the Angola Prison Rodeo. Each Sunday in October, inmates battle bulls without training for a few seconds of fame and some money. For Angola's warden, the proceeds of the rodeo fund the religious education of his inmates. "Razor Wire Rodeo" tells the unflinching story of lives defined by violence and crushed by the pitiless corrections practices in Louisiana. Jerry Brown believes his fame will help him to get out of Angola. But in a state, that hardly ever grants clemencies, his battle against the bull is symbolic of a fight for freedom lost a long time ago.
