Vacant Sky Vol. I

 Raised in the small town of East Naven, Auria Edith always dreamed of something more in life. Ironically, her opportunity finally came when she was murdered. After making a pact with a blond-haired man, she is brought back to the land of the living and finds herself lost on the other side of the world. As she seeks to find a way home, a cult called the Virad begins to follow her and brings suffering down upon all those who offer her shelter.
