The Hurling Stick

 Danny returns from short vacation in Ireland with a gift, a Hurler used in Ireland's national sport, for his associate Mick. Danny and Mick have been working together for ten years and it's kind of a anniversary present. It's also a going away present because Danny no longer wants to do contract work for the Irish Mob, in particular their most recent assignment. Mick is outraged and a bit nervous over the idea of walking out on a job that's already been assigned and insists that Danny go through with it. That way when he disappears the Mob bosses won't think Mick was in on it and come looking for him. Danny is adamant about not doing the hit but Mick won't let him off the hook, forcing Danny into a choice he is trying not to make.
