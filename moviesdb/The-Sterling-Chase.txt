The Sterling Chase

 48 hours until graduation 1999 at Chadley University. Three students are competing for the most prestigious achievement, the Stirling Chase Award. Jenna (Alanna Ubach) is having trouble coming to terms with her deep-seated fear of intimacy, in particular the advances of one 'Bunz' Berstein.Alexis is the budding senator whose lesbian relationship and deaf roommate are conveniently used in her quest for 'open mindedness'. As the graduation ceremony approaches the third nominee, Darren, is forced to make a choice between forwarding his career or staying true to his friends and himself. Nice ending where each character parts with at least a bit of their ignorance.
