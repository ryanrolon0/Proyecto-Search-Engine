The Flower Rule

 Blake's big sister Molly, 35, died before he could be the brother she deserved. To make peace, he did what came naturally - he broke the rules and picked flowers for her from the cemetery grounds where she was buried. Blake is oblivious to the disturbance he's caused the resident spirits on "the other side." When Molly is directed to make her brother stop the offensive behavior, she scoffs at the idea of the dead having any power to influence the living. Then, through a chance encounter with a sketch artist, Blake and Molly find their way back to each other and breathe new life into their unrealized deep affection for each other. Only now can he heal and she rest in peace.
