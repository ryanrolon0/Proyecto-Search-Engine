Svefnrof

 Svafnir roams the hallways of a large shopping mall, normally occupied by thousands, sweeping and mopping up the mess of others. But at night Svafnir is alone with himself. Alone with his thoughts and his dreams.. or at least , that's what he thought. Confronting the creatures of sleep can proof perilous and Svafnir needs to step lightly if he doesn't want to 'lose a head'.
