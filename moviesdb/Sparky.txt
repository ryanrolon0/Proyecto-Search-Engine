Sparky

 Sparky, whimsically and artistically, explores the concept of 'possibility'. Seminal paper cut-out pieces--that playfully re-configure themselves, create surprising new images, then come together to form a work of art--symbolize our potential for creativity, growth and transformation. Full of color and imagination, Sparky affirms our inner urges to grow 'toward the light.'
