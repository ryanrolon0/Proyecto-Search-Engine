Triple Trap

 Who is Alex Viso? What does he want out of life? To be rich? It seems so, and his plan is to rob a jewelery shop and to use Francois, one of his childhood friends and Laura, Francois' wife, to do it. But is it really so? Mystery, twists, surreal characters and grotesque situations reveal the players' real motivations and goals, because what it seems is not always what it is.
