Samaa

 Samaa' has spent her childhood learning dance. Belonging to the Palestinian minority in Israel, she encountered a rejecting cultural environment in the dance academies. Her father insisted that she gains an academic education. She turns to learn psychology at the Haifa University. But the passion for dance does not die in her and she tries to find a way to fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a professional dancer. An independent short fiction film, partially based on a true story that addresses the issue of intellectual dependence, directed in a realist style inspired by humanitarian cinema. The majority of the cast are non-professional actors playing their own characters with a semi-improvised dialogue. The film provides snapshots to the daily insecurities and hopes of the young Palestinian generation.
