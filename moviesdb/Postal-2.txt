Postal 2

 You are the infamous postal dude, and you are pissed. You wake up sick of your nagging wife, crappy car, run-down trailer, and just generally mad at everything about the corrupt little city you live in. All you have to do in the next week is menial chores and tasks. Armed with your trademark trenchcoat and shades, as well as an arsenal of readily available weaponry, you set out to complete your tasks in the most gloriously violent fasion possible.
