The Crossroad

 Mary stands at an intersection where she is confronted by three different roads. She needs make the right decision; each road leading to a different story. She chooses to make all three decisions. Using a non-linear narrative structure, this film confronts a number of different issues, including those relating to family values, Internet dating, and what really matters in life. Each road Mary takes will face each of these issues. When she isn't happy with the outcome, she uses the power of the intersection to rewind time and make a new decision. The title of the film 'The Crossroad' isn't referring to the setting, but is symbolic. It suggests that the centre of the film is the middle road that crosses between the three presented.
