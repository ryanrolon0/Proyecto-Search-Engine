Tribe

 Bellydance carries with it a burden of sexual connotations, sullying a dance form created by women for women to celebrate conception and birth. 'Tribe' explores the impact this has had on the dance in a visual poem following a woman's explorations of bellydance as spirituality, bellydance as objectification, and finally, bellydance as women's community.
