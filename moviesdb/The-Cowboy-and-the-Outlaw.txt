The Cowboy and the Outlaw

 The spring round-up is in progress, and the boys have been absent from the ranch for five weeks. Jack Dunton asks for a day off in order to visit his sweetheart at the ranch. He wishes to spend as much time as possible with her, so he takes a short cut over the mountains. The trail is seldom used, and he is in doubt as to the right direction, so he proceeds slowly. He is held up by a gang of outlaws and robbed of his horse. The outlaws have recently been active and the sheriff organizes a posse to trail and capture them, if possible. Jack meets the posse on the trail as he is slowly making his way to the ranch, and informs the sheriff where he encountered the outlaws, and that they have stolen his horse. Following the direction he has given them, the sheriff and his posse surprise the outlaws, but the leader escapes on Jack's horse. He is hotly pursued, but manages to elude them, and leaving the horse on the trail, makes good his escape up the side of the mountain. Traveling along the unfamiliar trail, Jack loses his footing and falls down a steep wall of rock and is severely injured. He is found by the outlaw, who nurses him back to health at the risk of his own life, for capture would mean death. When Jack is able to travel, the outlaw escorts him to the ranch and there meets Jack's sweetheart. They are both visibly impressed with one another. Jack is very weak, as they assist him to a couch in the ranch house. When he is alone with Jack's sweetheart, the outlaw makes love to her, which the hero-worshiping, romantic girl reciprocates; Jack comes upon them in fond embrace and a passion of anger surges through him. He pushes them apart, and then a revulsion of feeling comes to him. After all, he owes his life to this desperado. Taking the girl's hand, he places it in that of the outlaw and turns his back on his own happiness. At the gate, he meets the sheriff and realizes he is after the outlaw...
