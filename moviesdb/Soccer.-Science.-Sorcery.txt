Soccer. Science. Sorcery

 Rhythmic drumbeats can be heard at soccer stadiums the world over as fans support and encourage their team but in West Africa the drummer has been poet, priest, news bringer, historian and linguist over the ages. The film explores West African cultural and social traditions by using the drum as a symbol of the link between soccer, science and 'sorcery'. In the role as priest the drummer(and the drum) assist and enable people to be overcome by spirits or go into trance as part of ancient indigenous religions rituals(or voodoo). The film goes on to examine the place of these ancient traditions in modern West African society by picking up on similarities in religious expression between voodoo and more modern religions like Christianity and Islam.
