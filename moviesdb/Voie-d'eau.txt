Voie d'eau

 Sarah won't answer the phone anymore. She lost her unborn child. Lying next to the cradle, she is drifting... until she puts her finger in a glass of water and discovers that she can travel to some unknown underwater world. Even if no one but her believes in this strange gift, she decides to explore it.
