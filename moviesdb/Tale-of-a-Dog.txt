Tale of a Dog

 When Bigshot Jones gives his dog to the All-For-One Club, Buckwheat names it 'Smallpox'. Froggy and Janet mistakenly think that Bigshot has given Buckwheat the disease of the same name. Froggy, Janet, and Mickey proceed to incite a panic in the town of Greenpoint by spreading rumors of a smallpox epidemic.
