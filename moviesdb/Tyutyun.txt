He leaves his girlfriend Irina and marries the daughter of a wealthy owner of cigarette factory. Profitting from the death of his father-in-law and the mental illness of his wife, he assumes control of the factory and begins exploiting the workers even more mercilessly. He takes advantage of Irina's continuing affection and makes her first his mistress and later his wife. Boris plans a big business deal with a Greek tobacco magnate. The deal depends on the approval of the director of the German tobacco concern for Eastern Europe, von Geier.
