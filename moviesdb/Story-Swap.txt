Story Swap

 Story Swap brought together high school students from New Orleans and Haiti as partners to share an important story from their lives that has transformed or changed them. Each pair shared their stories via video conference and most of them spoke about their experiences with Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti Earthquake. The students were then asked to rewrite their partner's story and create an art piece that reflected the story they had heard. By receiving the story of another, making it their own and, then exchanging the recreated stories and visual art piece, participants experienced the transformative process of walking in another's shoes and sharing the view they saw from another's eyes. The documentary provides an inspirational overview of the Story Swap experience.
