U.S.S. 'Castine'

 "Shows the gunboat 'Castine,' assembled with the fleet in the Dry Tortugas. The view is taken from a steam launch, which approaches and passes the vessel. The decks are filled with sailors and marines, while the gunners are shown leaning over the guns from the various port-holes. The flag which is trailing from the stern is very large, and as it waves in the breezes produces a fine effect. In the background is seen the sidewheeler 'Whitney.' The picture is sharp and clear."
