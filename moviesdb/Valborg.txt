Valborg

 Valborg - The rite of spring It's Valborg - Walpurgis Night. The annual celebration of spring. The doctors' choir is rehearsing for tonight's celebrations. The only ones left at the hospital are the nurse, the medical intern and the patient care technician. The doctors trust them to give the patient the proper care. It is, after all, Valborg - Walpurgis Night.
