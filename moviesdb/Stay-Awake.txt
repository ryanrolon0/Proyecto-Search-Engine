Stay Awake

 The war in Yugoslavia serves as backdrop to an ethnic clash between a Serbian and Kosovar family in the Bronx. Once best friends, fathers Gregor and Mirosh now battle over the war abroad and their nationalistic obsessions, leading both to neglect their own families. Meanwhile, their children, Kosta and Lily, are secretly caught up in a romance. But before the two can successfully run away together, Mirosh discovers them and challenges Gregor to a street fight. In this final confrontation, the fate of both families becomes inextricably tied together by the very violence they fled in former Yugoslavia.
