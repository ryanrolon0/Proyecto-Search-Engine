The Linscott Case

 With a nod to the classic noir film Laura, legendary writer James Ellroy focuses on the rarely-filmed, California-dream-gone-bust, high-density sprawl of LA's San Gabriel Valley. A large-scale crime drama about a burned-out cop with an astounding artist's acuity, the horrible deed he perpetrates to assure his own survival, the opportunity he reaps from it, and the murder case that looms as his only vehicle of redemption. The Linscott Case is personal saga set against the backdrop of a corrupt elite, determined to keep society numb.
