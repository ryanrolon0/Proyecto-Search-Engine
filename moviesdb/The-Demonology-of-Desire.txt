The Demonology of Desire

 Late one night, Ramona makes a powerful wish. The following day, her prayer is miraculously answered when she meets Eric, a boy with no idea of the dark, fantastical depths that a boyhood crush can lead him. Equal parts fatal fable, romantic thriller and art-core horror, THE DEMONOLOGY OF DESIRE is a love story... with a caustic heart.
