The Switch

 On board a ship, somewhere in the Aegean , two young women meet accidentally.A young nun, on her way back to her monastery on one of Cycladic Greek islands, and a stripper, in between 'jobs'. Both have led lives directed by others, unable and unwilling to speak their minds and make decisions for themselves. But it only takes a second to change a lifetime! All they need is someone to handle the switch! And everything falls into place!
