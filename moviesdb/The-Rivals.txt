The Rivals

 Based on Sheridan's stage play - The Rivals - this is a circus of lusty, bodice-ripping liaisons, dueling, rapiers at dawn, back street tavern brawls, deceit, double deceit and double double deceit and all in the name of love! During the balmy summer of 1775 when best friends, Captain Jack Absolute, Sir Lucius O'Trigger and Bob Acres, all unwittingly fall in love with the same girl - the ravishing and very particular Lydia Languish. The sewage swirling cobbled streets and squalid cesspits of fashionable London town gets stirred to high heaven - and an awful lot more than love is in the air! The Rivals - could love's web be more tangled?
