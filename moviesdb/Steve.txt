Steve

 Four women all move into an apartment on the first of the month to live with their boyfriend. The problem is that it's the same apartment and the same boyfriend money so the women are stuck together in the apartment. Over the course of four days, as they await the return of Steve, they struggle to get along and find some kind of solace in their situation.
