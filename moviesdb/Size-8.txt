Size 8

 Size 8 is the story of Shelly, a young woman stuck in a dead-end job at the local dry cleaning service. Finding her job monotonous and looking for a way to escape from the doldrums of her everyday life, Shelly begins secretly borrowing garments from her customers. Each Saturday she chooses one garment from the dry cleaners to take home for the weekend, only to return it cleaned and pressed to her customer on Monday morning. Wearing the borrowed clothes, she imagines her life under much different circumstances. When a household accident forces her to abandon the privacy of her inner world, fantasy and reality are forced to collide.
