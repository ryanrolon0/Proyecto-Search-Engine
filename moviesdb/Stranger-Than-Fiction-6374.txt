Stranger Than Fiction 6374

 This edition takes a look at Billy Arthur, the world's tiniest editor, who edits "News and Views"; the building of exact replicas of famous battle ships; a sixteen-year-old boy who designs hats when not in school; a couple who tour in a strange home-made trailer made of spruce log; and a visit to Philadelphia for a tour of the only thimble manufacturing plant in the United States.
