Street Justice

 The Hood Ain't Pretty............ Hashim Garrett, a 15-year old victim of senseless gang violence, was shot 6 times, partially paralyzed with 12 holes in his young body, and left for dead on a Brooklyn, New York street corner. As he lay on the cold pavement Hashim begged God ' Please don't let me die'.
