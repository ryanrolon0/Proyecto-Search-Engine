The Curse of Griffith Park

 This is based on a true tale. A large ranch, now known as Griffith Park in Los Angeles, belonged to Don Antonio Feliz in 1861. The Don's best friend and a greedy attorney stole the property by orchestrating an illegal will at the Don's deathbed. After unsuccessfully contesting the will in court, the Don's blind neice, Petranilla, invokes a curse that remains to the present day. Angelina Feliz, a descendant of the Don, finds a map showing a hidden treasure underneath Griffith Park. A terrifying creature guards the treasure deep in a cave. Those who come close to the cave meet an untimely, bloody death.
