The Dakota Kid

 The Dakota Kid (Danny Morton as Dann Morton) is a young outlaw who joins a gang headed by Ace Crandall (Robert Shayne). Crandall's aim is to unseat Sheriff Tom White (James Bell) and then use his power to enrich himself at the community's expense. Dakota impersonates a long-lost nephew of the sheriff, and is made a marshal. Through his association with the sheriff's grandson, Red White (Michael Chapin) and his friend Judy (Eilene Janssen), plus falling in love with Mary Lewis (Margaret Field), the Kid gradually reforms.
