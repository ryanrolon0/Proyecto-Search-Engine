The Lady Has Plans

 Some dastardly criminals have stolen some top secret plans and tattoo them on the back of a woman so she can sell them to the highest bidder in Lisbon. This woman plans to take the place of a 'Sidney Royce', a legitimate traveler going to Lisbon as a reporter. Crossed signals allows the real Sidney to reach Portugal first, where she is pursued by those trying to obtain the plans and US government agents trying to prevent the sale. Paul Baker, in New York City, have stolen the plans for a radio-controlled torpedo, and has them tattooed in invisible ink on the back of his companion, Rita Lenox. They cold-bloodedly shoot the artist, and their plan is to have Rita impersonate newspaperwoman Sidney Royce, take her seat on the Clipper to Lisbon and sell the plans to the highest bidder. Things go awry and Sidney takes her own seat enroute to Lisbon, assigned to join the paper's Lisbon correspondent, Kenneth Harper. Sidney blissfully arrives in Lisbon unaware that her arrival as 'the lady with the plans' is being awaited by the Nazis, led by Baron von Kemp, and also by the English faction headed by Ronnie Dean.
