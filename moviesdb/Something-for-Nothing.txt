Something for Nothing

 Twenty eight year old Maynard Lassiter will die from a rare kidney disease, unless he receives a kidney transplant. Upon learning that his older brother, Jojo, the family bad boy, is a matching blood type, Maynard asks him to donate a kidney. But Jojo, who has a lifelong resentment towards Maynard, scoffs at the idea. As a child, Jojo believed that Maynard, who was adopted at birth, took all of his parents' love and attention. Therefore, Jojo now views asking for a kidney as another example of Maynard taking something from him. Eventually, after mounting financial woes and being pressured by their mother, Jojo reluctantly agrees to the donation. However, he attaches a list of demands so that he doesn't feel like Maynard is getting something for nothing. Tragically, Jojo's demands grow more sinister. SOMETHING FOR NOTHING is about what happens when resentment goes unchecked, and is allowed to fester throughout the hearts and minds of even the most well-intentioned human beings, making them seekers of revenge.
