The Real McCain

 Concerned that the real John McCain story was not being told, Robert Greenwald and his team at Brave New Films decided to do something about it and did extensive research about his flip-flopping. This DVD combines viral videos and interviews with people like activists Eli Pariser, Jim Dean and Greenwald himself.
