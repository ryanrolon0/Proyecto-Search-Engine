 The Government lays waste to Thailand's Golden Triangle poppyfields' production, and the Drug Lord seeks vengeance on the police forces involved. For 10 million Swiss Francs, he even buys the services of Madame Sue, a ruthless killer, to dispose of the Iron Angels, a trio of highly trained agents in martial arts and gunfighting... After a deadly opium bust, the police officers involved are murdered one-by-one. The Angels are called in to investigate, and must fight their way through the opium cartel to find the evil woman responsible.
