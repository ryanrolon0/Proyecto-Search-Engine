The Man Who Collected Food

 Miguel Appet is a serious collector. He must have the color variants, the rarities, the 1950s originals condition. No one but his overbearing mother knows that his home, tucked in the quiet suburb of Cibuston, has become a massive museum to comestibles. His neighbors to the right, dad Horace and son Eustice, don't notice a thing as they plot their next deer hunt (in matching lumberjack plaid). His neighbor to the left, Kelvin Green, is too busy searching for the alien he's sure attacked him once. And Miguel eats...people. He has to, since eating his precious food is not an option. However, being a cannibal is not as easy as it seems, especially when you have a collection of food to take care of.
