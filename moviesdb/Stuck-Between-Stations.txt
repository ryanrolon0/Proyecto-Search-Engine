Stuck Between Stations

 Stuck Between Stations tells a coming-of-age/came-and-went story about Casper, a soldier haunted by the horrors of war, and Rebecca, a whip-smart grad student with a shaky future. A decade after they graduated from high school and went their separate ways, they reunite by chance and get to know each other over the course of an accidental tour of the little-known underbelly of Minneapolis. The evening's odyssey includes a bar fight, a house party, a punk-rock circus, a spontaneous burglary, a home Casper didn't know he had, and a cast of strange characters, unexpected allies and disappointing friends.
