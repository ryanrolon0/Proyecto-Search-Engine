 The moving story of eight-year-old Daniel, who witnesses a quarrel between his parents. He is on his own at home, busy drawing, when the silence is suddenly shattered by his parents as they argue fiercely, paying no attention whatsoever to Daniel. Daniel withdraws inside himself and the real life where the quarrel takes place disappears. Daniel recalls an idyllic scene with his parents on his birthday last summer. He experiences a rude awakening from his dream when his mother notices his presence. Ridden by guilt, she says she is on her way out of the door as she sets off to the airport again. Daniel is left on his own, with his crayons and drawings, once again. The whole film is made - with flashbacks - in one single 11 minutes plan-sequence.
