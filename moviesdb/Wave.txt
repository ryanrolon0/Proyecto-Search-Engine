Wave

 A mother and young daughter are coerced into joining her ex-husband on a stolen yacht bound for the west coast of Africa. Five days into the journey a raging storm engulfs them, forcing the family to abandon the yacht. Trapped in a tiny life raft with little food or water they find themselves pitted not only against the elements but also against each other. Based on a true story.
