Si at alt går bra

 Smith is searching for his guiding star. For centuries his expeditions have been in vain. But then one night, just as he's about to give up, the star emerges - on the night sky above his bed. But the festivities are cut short, when Smith discovers the star is just a reflection in his window. Reason tells Smith that the star doesn't really exist, but in his heart, Smith knows he's found what he was looking for.
