 Laci Peterson is a pregnant mother to-be. On the eve of Christmas, she dissapears. Her husband, Scott Peterson, and her whole family searches for Laci. There are no signs of Laci anywhere. Months go on and on and the media and public, starts to think that Scott murdered his wife. The Rocha family support Scott, and defend him, until Scott's mistress Amber Frey holds a press conference admitting that she was having an affair with Scott, while he was married. This makes the Rocha family start to doubt Scott's innocence. Laci's mother, Sharon Rocha always believed Scott to be a PERFECT HUSBAND, but now she doubt's that. Finally the Rocha family publicly announce they are against Scott. In 2003, Laci's body and baby wash up on shore and she is officially declared to be murdered. The police arrest Scott and the movie ends here.
