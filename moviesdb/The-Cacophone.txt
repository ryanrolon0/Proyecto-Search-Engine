The Cacophone

 The Erfinder family is full of great musicians - except for Suzy. Seemingly bereft of her family's musical skills, she labors as a librarian, yearning for the excitement and adventures found in the books that surround her. Things take a turn for the bizarre when she is approached by a strange old man who offers to teach her to play the Cacophone, a mysterious and ungainly instrument with a long and sordid history. Her playing leads to a series of strange events that ultimately force her to confront her family's destiny and solve the mystery of the peculiar instrument.
