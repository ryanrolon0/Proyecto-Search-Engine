Richard III

 "Now is the winter of our discontent..." With these timeless words, Duke Richard - lounging on his sun deck - sets his murderous plans in motion. His goal undisputed king. Standing between him and the throne are his brothers Clarence and King Edward, his nephews the Princes, his bitter adversary Queen Elizabeth, and a host of enemies, rivals, and dubious allies. In the Los Angeles of "Shakespeare's Richard III", violence is the norm member of the nobility expects to kill or be killed, according to the code duel lo. They prefer death before dishonor. The women in this society are just as dangerous, courageous, and brutal as the men. The York and Lancaster families - rival branches of the former England Studios - exert a mafia-like control of the city and local politics/law enforcement. Aided by his sinister counselor Buckingham, Richard will stop at nothing - seduction, bribery, conspiracy, and wholesale slaughter - in his bloodthirsty quest, until finally just one adversary remains arch-rival Lord Richmond. But why, as the opposing forces join battle, is Richard smiling? What does he know that Richmond doesn't...?
