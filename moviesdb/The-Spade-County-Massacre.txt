It was through the brave leadership of Sheriff Stone Williams (Rex Sikes) that eventually brought the end to the order. It was the end to a terrifying era in Spade County. Recently, several teenagers were found dead with no leads and nothing other than several bizarre pieces of evidence. The sole survivor and prime suspect Doug Porter (Mark Mundt) had suffered psychological damage and could not give an account of what happened. The Spade County Massacre, as it came to be called remained a mystery.
