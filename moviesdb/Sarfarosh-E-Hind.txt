Sarfarosh-E-Hind

 55 years after attaining independence from the British, India still continues to struggle against issues such as crime, poverty, malnourishment, and corruption. A honest businessman Ranjit Singh, who is forced to bribe the State Chief Minister, Bandrekar, and a Pakistani ISI Agent, Ansari, so that he can open an arms factory; Megha, a press reporter, who witnesses the death of 3 terrorists at the hands of Raj, the son of the Chief Minister; D.C.P. Arun Bedi, who at one time was known as the Sarfaresh-E-Hind, is now a mere tool in the hands of his politically-motivated superiors and politicians; Ranjit's son, Amar, who is a college student, gets killed by terrorists; Pappu, the Chief Minister's married son, carries on with a number of prostitutes in his residence; and a crippled soldier sings and bemoans the regression everywhere. Amidst this background, Raj recalls that his father had killed his mother during his childhood, and has him arrested - knowing fully well that his father is a man who had not hesitated to kill his wife, will not surely spare him. The question remains the father? And who will even attempt to stop Ansari from inflicting sectarian and religious violence?
