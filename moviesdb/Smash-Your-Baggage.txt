Smash Your Baggage

 When a porter is hospitalized with a berth mark (putting his head in the wrong berth), the Benevolent Protective Society calls on the Black Knights of the Red Cap to do a show to raise money. A grand dress rehearsal in the high-ceilinged station starts at 4 a.m. An 11-piece band plays an up-tempo piece, followed by two tap dancing numbers dancing red caps, then the men dance an even faster one with athleticism and acrobatics. A woman seated with her luggage sings the blues, followed by a male dancer who uses a jump rope, and a finale with a chorus line of maids in uniform and couples dancing. Board the Tropical Express and the Sunshine Limited.
