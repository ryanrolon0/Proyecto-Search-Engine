The Seven Sages of Antiquity

 The Seven Wise Men of antiquity, or the Seven Sages as they are also commonly known, reflect one of the most brilliant aspects of the ancient Greek spirit. This documentary revives the period, 26 centuries ago, when the Seven flourished and enlightened humanity through their wisdom. On her return voyage to Sparta from Troy, Helen carried a golden tripod, which she dropped into the sea in order to prevent an old prophecy would become a cause to battle. That battle would then lead to the most unusual competition to determine the Wisest. The Seven Sages, of 6th Century BC Greece, are exceptional personalities distinguished for their extraordinary wisdom and knowledge as scientists, philosophers, statesmen and lawmakers. However, even the Seven would emulate only ONE!
