Strata

 A girl discovers a world through a puddle that seems to mirror her own. The boy she meets from this upside-down world finds her in a hole at the bottom of his well. But, just as the two begin to understand one another's worlds, they are torn apart by their ignorant parents. Yet, when they return to the portal, although the puddle has dried up and the well has been destroyed, an enormous tree grows in its place.
