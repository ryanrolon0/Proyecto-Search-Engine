The Mystery of the Million Dollar Hockey Puck

 Young teen Pierre Boulet and his pre-teen sister Catou Boulet are orphans who live in a Catholic orphanage in Chicoutimi, QuEbec. While in a florist shop one winter day, Pierre overhears Belletete and Napoleon, the shop proprietors, talking about a plot to smuggle $1 million worth of stolen diamonds out of the country, the diamonds hidden inside a hollowed out hockey puck. The plot involves retrieving the diamonds and the hockey puck from QuEbec City, where an unknown accomplice is constructing the hockey puck, and taking the puck to MontrEal to place in the MontrEal Canadien's equipment. The Canadien's will unwittingly smuggle the diamonds into the U.S. on their upcoming road trip. Sister Margaret, one of the orphanage administrators, does not believe Pierre's fantastical story due to his history of mischievous behavior. Despite knowing that Belletete and Napoleon know he overheard them, Pierre, with Catou at his side, decides to try and thwart the plan by recovering the diamonds himself. It is a race between Pierre & Catou and Belletete & Napoleon to get to the diamonds first, the latter two who concurrently are after the young pair. But what Pierre and Catou don't know is the identity of the smuggling plot's Big Boss, who will stop at nothing to protect the $1 million dollar cache.
