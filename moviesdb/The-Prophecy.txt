The Prophecy

 There exists an ancient manuscript still writing itself called the Lexicon. It supposedly tells of the coming of the Anti-Christ, and happens to fall into the hands of an unsuspecting woman. Now, she is being pursued by angels intent on obtaining the information from the book. In Bucharest, the tormented detective Dani Simionescu is investigating bizarre deaths with the heart removed from the victims. The Interpol agent John Riegert is assigned to be his partner in the case. Meanwhile, the clerk of the church Allison finds the local priest dead and a mysterious bible, "The Prophet Lexicon", where the last chapter about the apocalypse, called Revelations, is being somehow written. The voice of an angel, called Simon, advises her that she must protect the bible against a demon called Belial that wants to read this final chapter to have advantages in the war of angels.
