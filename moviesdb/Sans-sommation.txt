Sans sommation

 A discredited police inspector is given a second chance, in the form of a dangerous assignment. Chosen because of his uncanny resemblance to a Lt. Revere, the inspector impersonates him in order to penetrate a jungle camp belonging to a soldier of fortune friendly with Revere. He is then to assassinate Revere's friend.
