The Dying Light

 An unflinching look at the struggles of a father and his two sons as they attempt to salvage their long estranged relationships. When a man, who has "come home to die," appears on their doorstep, the tension between the men reaches a boiling point and without fully realizing it they find themselves standing on the threshold of life and death, struggling to find their relation to it... and each other. Inspired by life and set in the hauntingly beautiful desolation of a New Jersey shore-town in the off- season.
