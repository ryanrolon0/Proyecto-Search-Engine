Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2

 The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set out on their mission to defeat The Shredder and shut down the Foot Clan. Baxter Stockman's Mousers add madness to mayhem, but with the help of Master Splinter and Casey Jones, the turtles stomp the Foot and mangle the Mousers. In addition, the turtles must also return to the underground to help their mutant friends, as well as investigate the TCRI compound. There, they meet an ancient alien race known as Utroms. They have built a transmat device that can teleport matter from one place to another. The Utroms teleport the turtles into deep space right into a fierce battle between the Triceraton Republic, and a greedy Federation run by General Blanque. Not only that, but the turtles must show their true colors in a Battle Nexus tournament where they are pitted against highly dangerous adversaries, both human and inhuman. Will our heroes in green defeat the enemy, snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, and make it home in time for pizza and "Baywatch"? Play this 11-levels-of-fury, fast-paced game to find out, dudes!
