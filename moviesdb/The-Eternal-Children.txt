The Eternal Children

 At the beginning of this century they became friends in New York, a group of musicians that in the first place share a feeling of spirituality with each other. They never suspected it, mainly because their music seemed too obscure, but slowly but surely Antony & The Johnsons, CocoRosie and Devendra Banhart are now conquering the world. They achieve that completely on their own conditions and in their own liberated style. The Eternal Children offers a broad view on the colorful world of this group and their friends. The documentary includes a lot of unreleased music, rare live footage and crazy as well as illuminating interviews.
