Tombant

 Set in the boundaries of a nightmare, a young woman makes her journey up the aisle of a church, toward her waiting groom. This scene is broken by a series of non-linear scenes, each encompassing the young woman's thoughts and fears of things that have yet to come. As the scenes intensify with both speed and content, it all comes down to the front alter when the groom suddenly turns to her and asks if she is ready. Credits roll and the audience is left to question what of the film is real, what is imaginary and what the concept of love and relationship is all about.
