The Funeral

 A dark comedy about a young woman in her early thirties becomes aware of her own mortality and reacts by meticulously planning her own funeral. Possibly due to a lack of other big days in her life so far, such as a wedding, this becomes her moment to shine. A young woman meticulously plans for the funeral of Annie Ross. She spares no expense and leaves no aspect of the funeral to chance. Beyond the already unusual requests she makes in the preparation, the most unusual aspect is the subject of the funeral.
