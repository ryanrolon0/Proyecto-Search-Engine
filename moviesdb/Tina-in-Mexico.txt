Tina in Mexico

 Using reenactments, newsreel footage, and photographs, Longfellow tells the story of Tina Modotti (1896-1942), from 1920 when she's living in LA with artist Robo Richey to the assassination of her lover Julio Metta in 1929. She goes to Mexico in 1921 as Weston's companion, gets her first camera in 1924, and becomes an artistic photographer and a photojournalist, later a member of the Communist Party. Her beauty, liaisons, politics, and friendships with Rivera and other Mexican intellectuals are part of the story. But it is her observations, her journals, and her photographs - as well as those Weston took of her - that are the focus of the story.
