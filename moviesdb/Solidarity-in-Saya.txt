Solidarity in Saya

 This documentary examines the traditional Afro-Bolivian Saya music and the recent movement that uses this music to pursue their social and political needs. For centuries, Afro-Bolivians have remained isolated in rural poverty as subsistence farmers since the abolition of slavery. In recent decades, there has been a wave of urban migration, as new generations seek opportunity. While these youths face alienation and discrimination in their new urban environment, they build a supportive community around the Saya music group, which serves as a refuge from marginalization in mainstream Bolivian society. The social cohesion and unity cultivated within the Saya group has become a platform for political activism to confront the invisibility of the Afro-Bolivian minority. Rather than standing idle while the colonial hegemonic system of racial hierarchy defines them, the Afro-Bolivian Saya group members empower themselves by defining their own history and identity through these music performances.
