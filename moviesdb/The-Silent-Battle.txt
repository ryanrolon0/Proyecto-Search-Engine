The Silent Battle

 Aboard a continental express train, Draguisha is the instrument of a terrorist revolutionary party which seeks to kill the prime minister of Bosnia, free its political prisoners, among whom is Draguisha's father, and thusly precipitate a war in Europe. Jacques Salvin, a member of the French secret police, foils the plot and returns Draguisha to the protective arms of Bordier, her fiancEe and a French newspaperman.
