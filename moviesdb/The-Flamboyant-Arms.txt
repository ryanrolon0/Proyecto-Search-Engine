The Flamboyant Arms

 After receiving a call stating that Mr. Flamboyant will be arriving at the apartment for inspection, Clint tries to clean the place up. During the process, he goes through clogged up garbage chutes, broken trash cans, faulty electricity, and a leaking ceiling, all of which makes the place worse for the inspection.
