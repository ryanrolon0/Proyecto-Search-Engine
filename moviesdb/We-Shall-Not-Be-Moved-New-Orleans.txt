We Shall Not Be Moved New Orleans

 More than 100 New Orleans musicians and vocalists came together over nine months to create a "mega-" music video that would reach into the hearts of every New Orleanian, blast off this new arrangement of an old spiritual-and lift up an entire city. In the process, they hope to help both themselves and the people they love find, once again, the poignant, joyful harmony in which those afloat in this fragile bowl of land have always coexisted with nature's fury ... and with the ever-present waters that at once imperil and sustain them. This "powerful new anthem for New Orleans" seizes viewers by the heart at the crossroads of art film, anthem for social change and pop culture music video.
