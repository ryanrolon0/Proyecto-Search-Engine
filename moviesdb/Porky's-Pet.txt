Porky's Pet

 Porky and his pet ostrich, Lulu, get invited to perform on Broadway for $75/week. But first they have to get there, and the train conductor won't let the ostrich board. Porky sneaks her on. She gets loose and eats a sleeping woman's wig, a boy's toy airplane, and a concertina. Porky hides her in a guitar case, but she gets out as the conductor comes by, and they are both thrown off. They enlist a hand cart and a cow to outrun the train.
