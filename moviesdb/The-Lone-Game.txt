The Lone Game

 After Grace is hit by a streetcar, she is visited in the hospital by Dean, a friend of her brother Phil. They talk about Phil, who has contracted tuberculosis and has gone west to try to recover. Soon afterward, Dean's persistent cough is diagnosed as tuberculosis, and he also goes west. Then Grace herself contracts the disease. Lacking money for expenses, she goes to an open-air sanatorium near home. Now all three must play the 'lone game' of battling against the deadly disease.
