The Devil's Tower

 Outlaw "Dutch" Haynes is extorting money from the ranchers by threatening to blow up the dam that keeps the valley from flooding. To get to that point, Haynes, and his henchmen, have also practiced a little kidnapping, highway robbery, and all-around general connivery. But cowhand James Murdock has been on hand to stop the anti-social behavior, and looks to do so again regarding blowing up the dam.
