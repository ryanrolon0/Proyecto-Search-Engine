Rough and Rugged

 Originally conceived by the three stars as an audition submission for a major upcoming WWII feature, Rough and Rugged begins as a WWII newsreel, briefly documenting the lives of three strange small town American men before they enlist and head overseas to fight. In the second half we see them confronted by the horrible reality of warfare.
