This Guy Is Falling

 Alison buys a used car without consulting any men, including her boyfriend Bob and their friend Warren. On the dash is a switch marked "Gravity." Bob flips the switch, and all gravity, at least in L.A., disappears. They begin to float. Warren thinks about his girlfriend Laura who's over at the mall and may be in trouble. He grabs a fire extinguisher that's floating by and uses it to power himself toward Laura who has floated into the path of a jet airplane carrying plutonium. Can Warren save Laura? And what about the plutonium? Yipes!
