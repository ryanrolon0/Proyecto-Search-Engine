The Still Alarm

 An exciting run of the New York Fire Department's first battalion coming down Broadway, opposite City Hall Park, after emerging from the Chambers Street Fire Engine House. The horses come toward our camera at full speed, and the smoke and steam effects from the engines' smokestacks and whistles are excellent.
