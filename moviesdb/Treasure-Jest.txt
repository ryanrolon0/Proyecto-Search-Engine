Treasure Jest

 The fox is sailing the high seas looking for buried treasure. The crow, eyeing the fox as a sucker, passes his island home off as "Treasure Island", assuring the fox it is loaded with gold (which he proves by showing the fox phoney gold bricks which are really construction bricks painted yellow). However, there is a $2.00 fee for digging on his island which the fox refuses to pay. He tries to extract the "gold" by himself but the crow sabotages his efforts. First, he removes the blade from the fox's pickax. Then, the fox uses a steamshovel which the crow hammers in place causing the fox to swing from side to side when he operates it. Finally, the fox uses a jackhammer which the crow loads with fruit and explosives. The battered fox finally pays the $2.00 and is rewarded with gold. Alas, the paint washes off the bricks when the fox's boat sinks and the fox then wreaks his customary revenge on the hapless crow!
