Waiting for Sunrise

 Waiting for Sunrise explores extreme poverty in Lahore, Pakistan. Children without parents live in slums, cold and unloved, begging in order to stay alive as they endure verbal and physical abuse to earn enough money to live each day. These issues are rarely dealt with on such a personal and emotional level. Lahore and its collection of people becomes a character for this short documentary.
