Song of the Birds

 Little Audrey causes too much havoc indoors with her toy gun, so Mammy sends her outside. A little bird just learning to fly is her first victim, but when the bird's mother mourns over it, Audrey feels remorse. The animals stage an elaborate funeral for the little bird. But during the funeral, some rain falls on it, and revives it we discover it was only stunned. Audrey smashes her gun and tries to befriend the birds.
