The Planets

 Based on the famous Gustav Holst musical suite, this musical film takes watchers on a magnificent journey of the planets of the Solar System. Having nothing to do with outer space but everything to do with social and political consciousness, director Ken Russell and editor Xavier Russell construct a succession of montages to accompany the movements of Gustav Holst's symphonic tone poem. Imagery is drawn from war, sports, silent film, ethnographic movies, and stock shots. Music is played by Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Aired on Melvyn Bragg's LWT (London Weekend Television), 1983.
