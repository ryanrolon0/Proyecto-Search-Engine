Saleslady

 Department store employees Mary Dakin and Bob Spencer are married, with Bob not knowing Mary is the granddaughter of millionaire mattress-king Miles Cannon. Mary is content to live on Bob's salary but Bob loses his job and takes Mary to live with her grandfather and then finds out she is heir to a fortune. Bob, furious because Mary deceived him, is determined to make it on his own and goes into business with Crane, a competitor of Cannon. Eventually, Cannon, Crane and Bob decide to merge, and when Mary announces she is to have a child (the 1938 term for being pregnant), the Spencer family's future is assured.
