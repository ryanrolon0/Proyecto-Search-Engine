Socrates Draws a Circle

 Allured by the monotone resonating quietly from deep within her, a woman in kimono dives deeper and deeper into the unexplored areas of her internal world. In that depth, the logic of our world is collapsed while the monotone is echoing as if it called her and showed her the way to pierce through the chaotic inner space. Does this tone lead her to some sort of truth? Suddenly, at a certain point she realizes that the tone is bringing her into a forbidden area where the chaos of it all undermines her. Is the tone something really worthwhile to keep pursuing with that kind of sacrifice? Regardless of her discomposure, the monotone resonates more intensely inside her.
