The Notebooks of Cornelius Crow

 A man has worked out the meaning of London, a discovery that has put his life in danger. He leaves his findings, preserved in a series of hidden notebooks, to his protegee, Jack Cade, who must uncover their meaning, before a threatening and dangerous secret organization find Cade and exact their vengeance.
