The 4th Wall

 One fatal morning, John's door is left ajar. A strange woman slips through the crack in his orderly life. Is she a squatter, a wanderer or a woman from his past? As John's tidy flat is rapidly invaded, his inner space is also besieged. What started as a comic encounter changes his life forever. John, a lawyer, leads a comfortable life - drafting legal contracts by day, playing Don Juan by night. His romantic encounters are carefully recorded in a little black book... One morning his routine is disturbed by the appearance of an unknown woman in his apartment, who has walked through the door left open by a departing paramour. The woman is lost and looking for a Mr Ferry. John already late for work, wants to cut short this intrusion, but the woman never leaves the place, taking possession of it like a parasite. In the course of a few days, John will experience and encounter events which will shatter his ordered life... From the innocuous initial meeting, when the woman asks for a cup of coffee, it doesn't take her long to kick off her shoes and make herself completely at home, even hanging her clothes in his wardrobe. John's life takes on a surreal quality as he struggles to reconcile the demands of his daily routine and the presence of the woman.
