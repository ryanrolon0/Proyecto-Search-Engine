Texas Buddies

 Kincade and Blake cause a mail plane carrying a payroll to make a forced landing in the desert. When they try to get the money, prospectors Ted and Si drive them away. With the pilot shot, Ted takes over as pilot figuring another attempt will be made and this time the Sheriff will be there. Ted Garner, becomes an ace as an aviator in World War I, and then returns to Texas, replaces his helmet-and-goggles and airplane for a Stetson and his old horse-pal, Boy, and becomes a prospector with his friend Si Haller. Ken Kincaid and Blake have sabotaged and forced a U. S. Mail airplane to make a forced landing in the desert, with intentions of robbing the payroll it is carrying. Ted and Si come upon the scene and drive off the outlaws. The pilot has been wounded, but Ted takes over as the pilot and performs a different version of the old Pony Express term of "carrying the mail."
