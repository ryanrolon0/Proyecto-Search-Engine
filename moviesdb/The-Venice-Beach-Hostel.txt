The Venice Beach Hostel

 The hostel caters to young travelers moving through the Los Angeles area on their way to countries around the world. Some guests stay only a day or two, most times just overnight. The owner is a former world traveler herself, but at her age, she's now content to have the world come to her doorstep The transient aspect of The Venice Beach Hostel gives it the opportunity to swap out characters every week. This revolving door of characters keeps the show fresh with new personalities, new conflicts, and up-to-the-moment issues that affect young people around the world - religion, nationalism, fanaticism, love, sex, responsibility, politics... lost luggage. It's all rolled into one fast-paced show, packed with sharp dialog and characters. The young workers who manage The Venice Beach Hostel are themselves from various countries like England, Japan, Mexico, America, etc. Each character brings with them the baggage of their civilization. Though not deliberately metaphorical, The Venice Beach Hostel does seem like a microcosm of the world, albeit a comical one.
