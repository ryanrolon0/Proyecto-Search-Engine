The Fighting Marines

 Corporal Larry Grant and Sergeant "Mac" McGowan, of the Uniteed States Marine Corps, are rival for the love of Frances Schiller, but team up to hunt down "The Tiger Shark," a mad, scientific wizard who is holding Sergeant William Schiller, Frances' brother, a prisoner on a wild, jungle island in the Pacific. U.S. Marines, attempting to build a landing field on Halfway Island in the Pacific, unwittingly endanger the secret hideout of a mysterious figure known as The Tiger Shark. The Tiger Shark therefore begins a program of sabotage and murder against the Marines.
