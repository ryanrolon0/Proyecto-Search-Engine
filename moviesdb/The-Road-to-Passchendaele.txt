The Road to Passchendaele

 THE ROAD TO PASSCHENDAELE is a provocative and comprehensive documentary film which goes behind-the-scenes of the feature film. The documentary includes extensive interviews with many of Paul Gross and many others of the creative team behind the largest Canadian film ever made. The film also features unprecedented on-set access to the massive and muddy Passchendaele battlefield, and the means to recreating hell on earth. The documentary follows Paul and the Passchendaele team through the making-of the film, from the boot camp training session with the cast, to the Canadian Armed Force's involvement in the film, through to the challenges of accurately depicting one of the most brutal battles in our military history.
