River of Love

 While growing up, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi seemed to have so much going against her. Born in a poor country with a condition known as temporal lobe epilepsy (T.L.E) (see PBS NOVA _Secrets of the Mind_ for details on T.L.E.) and parents who did not understand her she went on to gain their love, conquer T.L.E., and progress to a living saint, the embodyment of love, a Bohdisattva.
