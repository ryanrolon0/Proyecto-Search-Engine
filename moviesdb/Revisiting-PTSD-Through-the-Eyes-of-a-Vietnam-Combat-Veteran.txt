Revisiting PTSD Through the Eyes of a Vietnam Combat Veteran

 This video captures the conversation between a Vietnam combat veteran and a Vietnamese American doctoral psychology student at the Santa Rosa VA Clinic. The Vietnam veteran attended an anger management group that the Vietnamese American student co-led. The veteran experienced a significant increase in his Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms when he joined the group due to her presence. As the group progressed, the veteran revealed that, during his combat tour in Vietnam, he had killed a young Vietnamese woman who closely resembled the Vietnamese American doctoral student. The veteran talks about the process of healing and his on-going recovery from the event as well as other traumatic events in Vietnam. Themes include combat-related trauma, PTSD, anger and guilt, and identity and meaning.
