The Queen, My Lord, Is Much, Much Better

 A 15-minute romp based on a comic essay of the '50s that imagines theatrical sabotage by bit-part actors in British productions of Shakespeare plays. Presented with theatrical photographs, largely taken in Massachusetts, and narration by a Boston-area artist.
