The Ghost of Sam Peckinpah

 The western is dead, or so says Hollywood. The cowboys are gone, turned into businessmen and real estate agents. In the town of Deep Sands lies Sam Peckinpah's ghost, waiting for someone with enough heart to bring back the western to the forefront of American cinema. Hollywood knows it's coming. Threatened by the resurgence of the western genre, action star Vin Diesel has already sent out an assassin to stop Sam and newcomer Jack Yeager in their tracks. But the drive of the western is too strong, and Jack and Sam begin their quest. Joined by Steven Seagal, the crew rides into Hollywood, doing whatever it takes to put the capital W back in Western.
