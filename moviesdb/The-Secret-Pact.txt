The Secret Pact

 Greg Sherman watches as two men assassinate his parents. He makes a lucky escape and enters a police protection scheme. His new identity, Steven Spencer (Spence), takes him to a prestigious private high school in Montreal. His parents' killers, however, know his whereabouts, though they do not know what he looks like. The tough but misunderstood son (Lenny Dalton) of a ex-crook is sent into the school under fake papers to find out the identity of Greg Sherman. Spence and Dalton become close after Spence saves Dalton from drowning. Dalton teaches Spence to fight, to stick up for himself against the older boys. They make a pact to always watch each other's backs. As their time progresses, Dalton's list of possible 'Greg Shermans' wears thin and he finally realizes it is his new best friend, Spence. Dalton must make the choice of whether to follow the orders of the men who killed both his father and Spence's parents, and kill the only witness, Spence himself. Interesting story about friendship, loyalty, and differences in upbringing.
