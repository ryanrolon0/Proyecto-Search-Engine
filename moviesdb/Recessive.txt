Recessive

 Shay is conflicted about whether to have a child with her wife, Norah. She struggles with her desire to be genetically connected to her own child--and with the knowledge that she may carry the marker for a serious genetic disorder. As Shay and Norah head off to the family home for the funeral of Shay's aunt, they must grapple with the nature of family, legacy, and parenthood. Recessive weaves experimental and personal documentary elements artfully into subtle acting to create a very modern, deeply emotional, narrative film.
