Springtime in the Rockies

 Buxom Sandra leaves the burden of work for a hiking trip. She soon thanks fellow hiker Derek for rescuing her from a an uncomfortable fall. Meanwhile, campers Linda and Tina catch Ranger Jim peeping on them and invite him to just join in. Later on, Tina gets lost in the woods while Ranger Jim offers Sandra a special cure against blisters. Tina stumbles into Derek and thanks him for saving her. As both Sandra and Tina told Derek not to use a condom, a future alien is shown finding it as a leftover by mankind. It seems to fit right in the alien's special tongue.
