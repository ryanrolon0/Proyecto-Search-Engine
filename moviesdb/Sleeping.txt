Sleeping

 Based on the short story by acclaimed author Katharine Weber, "Sleeping" is a coming-of-age tale about a young girl named Harriet who accepts a babysitting job, where the parents instruct her not to check on the baby. As the night unfolds, and Harriet fights her growing temptation to look in on the baby, she is brought to a cathartic moment of self-discovery.
