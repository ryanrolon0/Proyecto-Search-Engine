The Tramp and the Dictator

 Explores the making of 'Charles Chaplin' (qv)'s first "talkie" _The Great Dictator (1940)_ (qv) and draws many things that between Chaplin and Hitler had in common. The film contains colour home movie footage of the film's production which where shot by Charles' brother Sydney. These never before seen films were discovered by his daughter Victoria while looking though an old suitcase she found in the basement. The raw footage gives us an alternate insight to Chaplin's classic film which started production years before Adolf Hitler was seen as a major threat in the western world.
