The Universal

 The Universal is an experimental narrative that uses the idea of the time traveling motorcycle to fulfill the part of me that can never go back and warn my father. Each piece is a small piece of the bigger puzzle and it is up to the audience to fill in those gaps of space and time with their own experiences.
