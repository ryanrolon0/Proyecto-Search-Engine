The Reality Trap

 This satirical caper-comedy starts when a repentant ex-adulteress/sociology professor goes on a talk show to promote her book on adultery and is surprised by the host, who confronts her with the wives of her ex-lovers. Humiliated, she hatches a brilliant plot that will culminate in the host's humiliation. He realizes she is after him and starts his own counter-plot,raising the stakes in this cat and mouse game and leaving the winner very much in question.
