Post War Inventions

 Gandy Goose is reading a book about Post-War Inventions. Sourpuss doesn't like it one bit, and that night he dreams that he has come to a hall of new inventions. At first he's impressed, but things begin to go wrong with the inventions, and when he finally wakes up, he promptly smashes the book over Goose's head. Gandy Goose stays up one night reading a book called "Post War Inventions". His roommate, Sourpuss the Cat, is annoyed by the light and demands that Gandy come to bed. As they sleep, Sourpuss has the title of the book on his mind, and so does Gandy. They dream of being up in the clouds where Sourpuss finds Gandy outside an enormous gleaming building. Gandy informs him that inside is the Post War World. Gandy shows Sourpuss a rocket ship, dehydrated food, a robot waiter, a modern kitchen, a modern bathroom and an enormous television with images that are all too real.
