Swallow the Leader

 Migrating swallows are making their annual spring return to San Juan Capistrano, and a hungry cat awaits them with a radar scope and with his mouth and head disguised as a bird's nest. The clever advance scout for the flock of swallows tricks the cat into ingesting a metallic statue of a swallow, then uses a magnet to pull the cat through pipes and the prongs of a ladder. Hundreds of swallows then dive-bomb the cat with light bulbs and thumb tacks.
