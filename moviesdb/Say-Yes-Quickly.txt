Say Yes Quickly

 Hannah has spent the last year living in her bedroom writing a novel with the help of a mysterious person who communicates only over the internet. Calling himself @lien, Hannah's mentor has come to dominate her mentally and emotionally. After meeting Henry on a rare trip outside, Hannah starts to re-engage with life. When Henry decides to go on a trip, Hannah tags along, secretly planning to meet @lien. @lien, however, is upset with Hannah's 'abandonment' and also decides to go in search of the person who means so much to him.
