Rambling 'Round Radio Row #6

 A radio salesman is trying to sell some gypsies a radio. But they have their easy to operate crystal ball, that even works as a TV. They show him how easy it works by listening to the doings of the Rhythm Boys, Tito Guizar, the Picken Sisters and Ann Lee, and let him try to receive a Frank Hazard program.
