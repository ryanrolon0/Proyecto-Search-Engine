That World is Gone

 Revealing the nearly-forgotten history of Charlottesville's largest African American neighborhood, Vinegar Hill, this documentary explores black property ownership and the area's federally-funded destruction in 1965. Surviving residents describe the neighborhood they knew and loved, and consider future prospects for black residence and success in the city.
