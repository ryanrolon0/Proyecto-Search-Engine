Two Thousand Maniacs!

 The citizens of the southern town Pleasant Valley lure six Yankee tourists into town where they are to be the reluctant guests for the centennial celebration of the day a band of renegade Union troops decimated the town. The town then participates in events, a different event for each of the tourists, in which the tourist is dispatched. One couple begins to suspect something and seeks a way to escape. It's 1965 and the residents of Pleasant Valley, Georgia are celebrating their centennial and they divert six tourists to their town. There, the unsuspecting six are treated as guests of honor but in fact will soon be the victims. The centennial the town is celebrating is its own destruction at the hands by a group of Union soldiers during the Civil War and their goal is revenge. One by one, they kill their guests of honor until only two remain. They flee but can't quite convince the police to help them.
