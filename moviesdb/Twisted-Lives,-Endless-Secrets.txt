 A once leading soap opera writer, Bill on a once hot show, with now declining ratings, overhears a plan to have him fired. In retaliation he writes into his script a series of twists, not realizing that God is having the same difficulty writing his life story. As the soap descends into melodramatic nonsense and the leads are killed off, we step into the heavens to see what is in store for Bill...a happy ending? Expect more twists!
