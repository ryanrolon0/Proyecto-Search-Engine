The Bunk Witch Project

 Tracy Donner, Jack Earwell, Matt Anderson, and Eric Duboix disappeared in the woods while documenting The Bunk Witch of Gnaw Bone. A year later, their footage is found by a group of rednecks. After trying to eat it, and deciding it wasn't edible, the rednecks turned it over to the police how threw it in a corner where it rested for a few months. Then an amateur filmmaker put together their footage to find out what really happened to them... and maybe even make a quick buck on the side. This film is a chronicle of their last days, as they have to put up with hunger, fear, fatigue... and each other.
