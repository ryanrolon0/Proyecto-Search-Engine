Super Lulu

 Little Lulu is reading comic books when her father finds her. He instructs her to read something of value and sends her to her room with a copy of "Jack and the Beanstalk." Lulu reads the story, but still prefers her comic books and superheroes. She falls asleep and dreams that her father has gone up a magic beanstalk. Lulu follows her father to a giant's castle in the clouds, where he is trapped. Lulu uses her superhero alter-ego to fight the giant and save her father. When Lulu wakes up, she discovers that her father has been tied up by a burglar and must use her superhero knowledge to really save the day.
