 Nature collides with industry as a delicate spider balances on a silken web, metallic automobiles speed through a concrete maze, and majestic birds take flight over lush forests. This cinematic symphony of images builds into a powerful reminder of mankind's relationship to Mother Earth. A stunning celebration of life in all its many forms.
