The Making of 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'

 Comprehensive, non-narrated made-for-LaserDisc documentary about the making of the 1982 blockbuster classic. The story is told through interviews with director Steven Spielberg, co-producer Kathleen Kennedy, sound designer Ben Burtt, composer John Williams, and other key cast and crew members. It also includes rare, behind-the-scenes footage taken at the time of the original production, and deleted scenes not seen in the final cut (including the legendary "Principal Scene" with Harrison Ford).
