Song Demo for a Helen Keller World

 SONG DEMO FOR A HELEN KELLER WORLD is a privileged peak inside the brilliant mind of John Trubee, artist, musician, composer, misanthropologist, cultural terrorist, underground legend and creator of the infamous anthem, "A Blind Man's Penis". See and hear seven new songs being rehearsed and recorded by mastermind John Trubee and his band, The Ugly Janitors of America. These malignant melodies savagely attack the puny humans who over-populate this vast graveyard we call Earth. Trubee's targets include parasitical greedy women who lust only for money, brainless infantile consumers who slovenly suck on the cold glass tit of television and all of the liars, cheaters, dummies and morons who run the world. Abandon hope all ye ninnies who enter here!!
