Tale of a Wolf

 Loopy de Loop's sole mission in life is to convince the world that wolves are really gentle, honest, law-abiding citizens but first he must teach the wolves that they are really gentle, honest, law-abiding citizens. And he is having a problem in that arena. A wolf-cub steals a chicken to take home for dinner---for dinner not to dinner---and Loopy returns it to the barnyard hen-house and runs afoul of the cynical watchdog who is convinced that Loppy is taking instead of returning said chicken. Then the cub steals a little baby pig and when Loopy returns it, the dog isn't buying his story the second time around. But Loopy is big on being a martyr...and gets to be one.
