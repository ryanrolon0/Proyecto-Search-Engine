The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight

 This legendary fight was filmed on March 17, 1897, using 63mm film that produced an aspect ratio of about 1.75 Enoch Rector recorded the entire fight, simultaneously creating the world's first known feature film, as the resulting footage lasted over 90 minutes in length. About a quarter of the film survives today.
