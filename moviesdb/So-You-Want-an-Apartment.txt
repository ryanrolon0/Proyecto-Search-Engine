So You Want an Apartment

 Joe McDoakes and his wife, Alice, are at the mercy of their landlord. He has done everything he can think of to get them to move out of their apartment, so he can renovate the place and charge more rent. The McDoakeses are the last ones remaining in the building. They finally start looking for an apartment, but their search search is filled with frustrations. Made during the post-war period of pressing apartment shortages, Joe McDoakes senses an attempt to force him out when the landlord puts an elevator shaft in the middle of his living room. After eviction, he is swamped with offers ranging from rooms in condemned tenements to black-market bungalows. He finally signs an expensive (relatively speaking) $500 lease for his old apartment.
