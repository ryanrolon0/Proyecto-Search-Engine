Punto y raya

 Cheito, a street-wise Venezuelan conscript, is thrown together with Pedro, a straight-arrow volunteer in the Colombian army, when one deserts his company and the other lives through an ambush. They must survive guerrillas, drug producers, corrupt narcotics officers, and each other as they bungle through the jungle friends, until women and politics test their loyalties. Can pawns survive when powers clash?
