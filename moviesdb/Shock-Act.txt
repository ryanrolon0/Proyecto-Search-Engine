Shock Act

 Vernon Phelps, an out-of-work actor living with his father in a squalid Brooklyn appartment, lands a job simulating electrocution for a prison research experiment. The experiment will determine whether or not female guards have the emotional resolve to execute convicts. "Shock Act" is about Vernon's journey as an actor, and about the inhumanity of the death penalty.
