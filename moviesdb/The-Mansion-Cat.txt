The Mansion Cat

 The owner of a large house tells Tom he's going away for a while, the house is in perfect shape, and that he doesn't want Tom blaming "the mouse" (who's a family pet, in a cage) this time. Of course, this means Tom will spend most of the picture chasing Jerry around the house, causing extensive damage. Among the sequences resulting cassette-sized cat; Tom traps Jerry in a coffeemaker; Jerry traps Tom in a refrigerator, and he comes out again in ice cubes; Jerry sucks Tom and half the living room into a vacuum cleaner; Tom chases Jerry through the yard and into the house on a riding lawn mower. At the end, he crashes the mower into his owner's returning car, and is told he makes a better hood ornament than a house cat.
