Pravidla lzi

 33-year-old Roman is one of twelve people who decide to undergo group therapy in an isolated community in order to tackle their drug addition. Like the others, he also brings with him a murky past which he tries to come to terms with - perhaps it will help him find a new life for himself. But in this thickening atmosphere of suspicion and lies, who can still be trusted? This intimate psychological drama won a Czech Lion for Best Screenplay and the Film Critics' Prize for Best Film.
