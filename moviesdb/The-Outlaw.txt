The Outlaw

 Michael B. Common is one of the last smokers left in Britain. He leaves his job in a bank and sees on the news that he is the last smoker as the other one was shot by his friends in what the police are calling "self defence"! Michael makes his way home through a PC London to smoke away from the law.
