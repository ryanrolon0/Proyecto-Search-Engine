The Neon Rose

 With light-drenched visuals illuminating a screenplay of "dialogue and poetry," filmmaker Gerson made this short B&W experimental feature about a man who confronts the meaning of existence in a variety of cityscapes. Gerson described the film non-linear sequences within a linear structure. Past, Present and Future are interwoven throughout to present a total, heightened reality."
