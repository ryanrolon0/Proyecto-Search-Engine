Razor Sharp

 Impenetrable fortresses, SWAT trained security forces, the occasional piece of malfunctioning gear; it's all in a day's work for corporate thief Veronica Sharpe (Cassidy Freeman). But business turns anything but usual when she's hired by her underworld boss (Michael T. Weiss) to steal an exotic codebreaker from a high-security skyscraper. After breaching the tower's defenses, Veronica's morality and skill are put to the ultimate test when she's confronted with the dark reality of the codebreaker itself. Loaded with as much humor as edge-of-your-seat action, and a dynamic cast featuring Adam Gregor and Skye McCole Bartusiak, Razor Sharp is one thrill ride that's criminal to miss.
