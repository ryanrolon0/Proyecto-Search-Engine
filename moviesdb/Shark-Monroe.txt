Shark Monroe

 Shark Monroe is the captain of a sealing vessel in Alaskan waters. He takes on Marjorie Hilton and her brother Webster as working passengers when they are left stranded. Though a tough, hard-bitten man, Monroe finds himself mellowing under the influence of Marjorie. He protects her from the unclean desires of the white slaver Big Baxter, and ultimately Marjorie sees the decent man behind Monroe's coarse exterior.
