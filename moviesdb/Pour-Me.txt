Pour Me

 A short film about John, an older man whose life is seemingly tattered and empty. He's a chronic alcoholic who's admittedly better at drinking than being a father and husband. His daughter, now grown and married, joins her mother and husband as they try to hold a private intervention for John. Convincing John to give up the bottle for Jesus, he goes along with his family's wishes to attend church and give his life over to the Lord. Or does he? The viewer will have to decide how it's all been played out when John's involved in an accident and h is demons prey upon his family's innocence.
