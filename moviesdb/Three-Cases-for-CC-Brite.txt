Three Cases for CC Brite

 C.C. is a new...well, an old type of private eye in the mold of Nancy Drew, Kim Aldrich and Trixie Belden. With the aid of her gal Friday, Dottie Darling, watch CC as she solves three cases with ease and delight. The Case of the Inside Out Inheritance, The Case of the Crooked Frame Up and the Unreal Real Estate Deal are no match for our super sleuth. She's a loner, ready to solve the mystery. Sure, she would KNOW the Scooby gang...but it's doubtful she'd get along with them. Please join us as we watch C.C. solve her next case.
