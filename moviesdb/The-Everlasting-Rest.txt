 Jake, a failing playwright, is fully aware of his wife's less than faithful nature. He believes he has cleverly written a play about his wife, who is suspected of cheating on him. But is Jake squandering for some artistic inspiration and creating suffering in order to write? Or has he finally face the truth that their marriage was never suppose to be.
