The Right Hook

 You all know Bruno...Bruno is a born loser with the ladies. Scoffed and scorned, the only thing Bruno could pick up in a singles' bar is the check! Until now. Now Bruno sees the girl of his dreams and he'll fight all odds to win her - even her lesbian girlfriend. In a 10-minute brawl of hilarity, Bruno finds "The Right Hook," a short film that asks the age-old question, "Yeah? Who said you can't hit a girl?" and who's answer gives a whole new meaning to "hitting on women!"
