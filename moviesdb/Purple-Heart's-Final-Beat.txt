Purple Heart's Final Beat

 An American veteran returns home to find a foreclosure notice and a warrant for his arrest taped to his front door. This film takes us through a story that's all too common, leading up to this day, and all too horrifying as he makes a choice that countless veterans every month make. A choice that most of us are too terrified to consider.
