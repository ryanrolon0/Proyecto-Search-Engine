The Men's Room

 A woman in a man's world. A blue collar worker in a white collar environment. An immigrant in a foreign land. All these things seem to set the Janitor apart, isolating her from her world. But why should these things cause her unseen employers to torment her as they do, day in and day out? What she fails to understand is that, in the Men's Room, the rules of communication all get flushed. Nothing is as it seems. Etiquette and decency follow their own laws. You need to look past what's right in front of you in order to understand the larger concept. Because in the Men's Room, it's not you, it's pee.
