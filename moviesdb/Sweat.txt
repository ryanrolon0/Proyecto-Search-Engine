Sweat

 Sweat is the story of an afternoon of debauchery and intrigue as Simon takes leave of his senses and heads for a sauna. Negotiating the humiliating locker room strip where he inadvertently injures a fellow punter, he forges his first impromptu introduction to a handsome man called Tim. Nerves prohibit normal conversation as they share an empty sauna and both of the attractive men shy in each other's presence. Later, Simon encounters an opportunistic rent boy called Tiger and is amazed that at seventeen, he seems to have learned more about sex than Simon has in all his twenty-five years. Further into his journey, an experiment with poppers and some very public sexual displays, leave him wondering what he came for, and possibly leaving none the wiser, albeit with a phone number and a wry smile.
