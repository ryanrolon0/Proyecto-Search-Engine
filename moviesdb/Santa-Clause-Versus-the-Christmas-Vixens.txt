Santa Clause Versus the Christmas Vixens

 Late on Christmas Eve, 4 girlfriends want to travel to Las Vegas only to discover that their car has broken down. Despondent, they find that they may have won a brand new car as a Television promotion. They drink to their good fortune and wait for the studio's "Santa" to arrive, only to have him be a no-show as midnight approaches. When the real Santa arrives, they are hurt and angry and vengeful. No small wonder they take out their frustrations on the innocent Saint Nick. What ensues is a hilarious comedy of errors with poor Santa getting the worst end of everything.
