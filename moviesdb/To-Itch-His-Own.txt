To Itch His Own

 Mighty Angelo is billed as "The World's Strongest Flea" by the urban circus at which he performs. Angelo decides to take a vacation on some quiet, country dog and hops into the fur of a shaggy pooch sleeping on a suburban estate. When a belligerent bulldog disturbs the pooch's- and Angelo's- sleep, Angelo decides to fight the bulldog. The bulldog is befuddled by the unseen powerhouse that drops bricks on his head, pulls him through a knothole in a fence, and whacks him on his head and backside with a mallet. Norbet's Flea Circus has a sign outside World's Strongest Flea." And there on the sign, lifting a barbell that would be too much for most full-grown men, is Mighty Angelo himself, a muscular green insect with two antennae, a handlebar mustache and a menacing glare. One night, Angelo decides he has been working too hard lately and leaves to take a vacation on a "nice quiet dog in the country." He eventually picks a passive little pooch. The dog is a bit disconcerted at first. Every time he scratches, the unseen Angelo stomps on him, causing him to vibrate as if from a shock wave. The inconvenience is a bit annoying, but worth it. Angelo is a flea who is willing and able to protect his home against outside threats. And a threat is exactly what Butcher, the bulldog next door, proves to be.
