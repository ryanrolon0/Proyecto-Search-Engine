The Veils of Transference

 This humorous dialogue between a robot and human in a therapy session exploits a human's desire to be robotic and a robot's programmed desire to be human. Roles of analyst and analysand are constantly in flux; the therapist and patient engage in mind-games based on a switching of, and uncertainty about, their roles -- human as machine and machine as human. The session is set in a green-screen environment which displays the accompanying dreams and unconscious narratives and the human's mind and the robot's database. "Veils" was funded by both the arts and science communities; made possible by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Franklin Furnace Fund for Performance art, among others.
