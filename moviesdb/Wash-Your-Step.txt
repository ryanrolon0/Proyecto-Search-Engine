Wash Your Step

 Sales at the Complex Washing Machine Co. are dismal, but one salesman (Hal Le Roy) is successful because he sings and tap-dances his sales pitch. Fired after being sent to his boss' house on a sales call by a conniving sales manager, he is hired by the rival Come Kleen Washing Machine Co. to train a singing and dancing sales force. Sales go up, and Hal Le Roy also wins the heart of his former boss' daughter. This was a Vitaphone "Broadway Brevity".
