Trail of Terror

 Belle Blaine, owner of the Crystal Palace Saloon at the Cold Springs outpost, makes plans with Nevada Simmons to rob the stagecoach. Curly Wyatt, the stage driver and infatuated with Belle, agrees to take part. In a fight at the Red Rock relay station, the station attendant, Al, is wounded but recognizes Curly among the outlaws. Texas Rangers Dave Wyatt, Jim Steele and Panhandle Perkins are on their way to Red Rock, where Dave tells the other two he expects to see his twin, Curly, whom he hasn't seen in years. At the station, Al mistakes Dave for Curly and accuses him of being in on the robbery. Meanwhile, Curly has had a change of heart, and, after taking the robbery loot away from gang-member Hank, is hiding out in a cabin and sends for Dave, with the intention of returning the money. The gang arrives after Dave, and Curly is killed in a shootout. When the gang enters the cabin, Dave poses as Curly and makes them believe it was his twin that made off with the loot, so he can find the leaders and bring them to justice.
