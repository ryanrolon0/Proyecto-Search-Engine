 Little attention has been directed toward evidence that an early-in-life oral infection with the potential to reach epidemic proportions is threatening the health of youths around the world, from China to Israel. Health professionals and the public seem unaware that the silent disease is targeting millions of children and young adults, their smiles and, consequently, their emotional and psychological lives. The aim of this movie is to help raise the level of awareness, so that those who have the power and knowledge can appropriately address the suffering of the youngest members of societies. A solution for preventing the infection is proposed.
