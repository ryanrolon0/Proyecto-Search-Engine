Sistagirl

 SISTAGIRL defies stereotypes of what it means to be an indigenous Australian today. This culturally rich, emotional and visually stunning documentary tells the story of award-winning photographer Bindi Cole's confronting artistic journey to the far north of Australia to document the beautiful, little known, transgender 'Sistagirl' community of the remote Tiwi Islands.
