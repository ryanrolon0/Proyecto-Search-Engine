Roadkill

 A group of friends is on a scenic RV road trip through Ireland, but their cross-country adventure takes an unexpected turn when they accidentally run down an old gypsy woman. Before she dies, the woman curses them, summoning a giant bird of prey called a Simuroc to exterminate the young people, one by one.
