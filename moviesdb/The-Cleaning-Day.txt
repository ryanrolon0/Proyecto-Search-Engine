The Cleaning Day

 Kiko the Kangaroo has problems with his house cleaning when Ozzie the Ostrich keeps getting in his way. But Kiko manages okay and keeps his temper in check until Ozzie gets tangled up with the electric vacuum cleaner, and it starts sucking in all the furniture, and pursues Kiko and Ozzie when they escape from the house.
