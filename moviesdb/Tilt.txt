Tilt

 TILT is a love story set against the backdrop of the changing political and social environment in Europe in the late 80's and early 90's. Can this love survive the challenges of emigration, a violent homeland and immoral social atmosphere thanks to a gang of adventurous friends? TILT is a love story dynamically told in the style of adventure drama. The name comes from playing the game of pin-ball and means a complete blockage. The main character Stash (Yavor Baharoff) together with three of his friends dream of opening their own bar with pin-ball machines, pool tables and cool music. An accidental meeting with Becky (Radina Kardjilova) grows into a dangerous romance, which puts the characters in a real-life TILT situation.
