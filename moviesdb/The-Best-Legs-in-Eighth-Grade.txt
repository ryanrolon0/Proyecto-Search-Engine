The Best Legs in Eighth Grade

 A man meets a woman at a gym who turns out to be from his 8th grade class. She had been voted "Best legs" in his class, and he thinks she looks gorgeous now. The chance meeting causes him to reflect on his life up until then and the choices he's made, including how his current girlfriend pales by comparison.
