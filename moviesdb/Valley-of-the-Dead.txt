Valley of the Dead

 A Containment team, lead by the reckless Lt.Brantner, is tasked to find & terminate Drake Morris, a disgraced solider who has gone rogue and in-hiding somewhere in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. As they set out on this perilous journey, they encounter many threats, including hordes of infected, mutants and rebellion within the platoon itself. This mission takes them closer to total insanity as it not only tests their resolve,morale and integrity, but also their will to survive as they inch closer to learning the true reason behind their deployment.
