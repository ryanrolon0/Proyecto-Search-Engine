Tre quarti d'ombra

 Three-quarters Shadow is about a psychoanalytical session. The entire short is set in a room that is represented in two dimensions reality of the session and one to the interior world of the main character. The actions take place in a a continuous oscillation, emphasized by the rocking chair's movement and by the pendulum-clock that beats the passing of time, between two worlds that articulate themselves in the dialogue with a man/child locked in a trunk. She lives the fear of seeing them emancipate and escape her control, coming to the conclusion that sinking into shadows is the only way to bring light upon certain concealed truths of her being.
