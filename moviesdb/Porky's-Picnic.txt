Porky's Picnic

 Porky asks Petunia on a picnic. Unfortunately, bratty baby Pinkie tags along. First he separates their sidecar from Porky's scooter, then he torments a squirrel with scissors and Porky with a board, then he sneaks into the animal cages at the zoo. Porky saves him, earning a big kiss from Petunia. Finally, Pinkie sneaks up on a cute little chipmunk with the scissors and the chipmunk gets even.
