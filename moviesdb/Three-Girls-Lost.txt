Three Girls Lost

 Architect Gordon Wales finds fellow apartmenthouse resident Joan Marsh locked out and flirts with her. When she is murdered evidence points to him. He and Joan's roommate Noreen become involved. Three smalltown girls, Noreen, Edna, and Marsha, arrive in the big city and rent an apartment together. When Marsha becomes locked out without her key, handsome architect Gordon Wales helps her get in, and a mild flirtation developes. Gordon gets Marsha a job with wealthy William Marriott, who falls for her. Marriott, though, is a racketeer with vengeful enemies. When he is murdered, Gordon becomes a suspect, due to remarks by Marsha that cause the authorities to think Gordon was jealous of Marriott over Marsha. Gordon, however, has found himself truly attracted to Marsha's roommate, Noreen. Noreen nobly enlists her smalltown sweetheart in Gordon's legal defense.
