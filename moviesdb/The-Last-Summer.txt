The Last Summer

 A bitter class clown, Andrew Fitzsimmons has just graduated high school. He wants nothing more than to escape from his hometown and start fresh in college. He wants to run away from the pressures of always being the funny guy, but also from the regret he feels from never telling the girl of his dreams, Hailey, how he feels. It's been two years since they met and Andrew has yet to say a word about his true feelings for her. Stuck in the 'friend zone', Andrew has convinced himself that it will never happen between the two. Now with three months until they go to different colleges, Andrew must decide if he can get over the hump and make a move. With the help of his three best friends, Andrew slowly begins to learn that who you are in high school does not define who you are in college and beyond. A series of 'almosts' and 'could have beens' culminates as the last party of the year and leaves us with a truly bittersweet climax between Andrew and Hailey.
