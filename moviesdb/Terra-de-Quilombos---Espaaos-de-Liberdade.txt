Terra de Quilombos - Espaaos de Liberdade

 Documentary about communities in Santo Antônio dos Pretos (State of Maranhão), Casca (State of Rio Grande do Sul) and Kalunga (State of Goiás), in Brazil. These communities resemble the old institution of Quilombo, an independent black community which fighted the Government, and was one of the oldest and most important traditions of resistance and fighting for freedom in Brazil.
