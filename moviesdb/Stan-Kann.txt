Stan Kann

 An intimate portrait of Theater Organist/ Entertainer/ Vacuum Cleaner Aficionado, Stan Kann, the film chronicles Kann's lengthy career and his lifelong obsessions with music and collecting. From roller rink musician to silent film accompanist, to Movie Palace gadabout, Kann has lived a charmed life of hobby and enthusiasm. An unmatched success as a network television personality - appearing as the self-styled Guru of Gadgets 77 times on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, 89 times on The Mike Douglas Show, and countless other appearances through the 1970s & 80s - Kann's gregarious personality and his improvisational skills made him a household name. Utilizing interviews with Kann, archival footage of his television appearances and contemporary footage of Stan in action, the film celebrates all that is Kann, from his talent to his quirky personal interests (cars, music, and a peculiar collection of 135 antique vacuums!).
