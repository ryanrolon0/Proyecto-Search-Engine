Ragwurz

 Ragwurz portrays thirteen groups and individual dancers in the mountain farms of South Tirol, showing dances in barns, the typical ways of life in the area's paneled parlors, the people of the region as they go about their work. The dancers speak of dreams and of special events in daily life, of ambitions to improve, of the joy experienced in movement, of the difficulty of remembering steps, of the happiness of blending together with music.
