Redlove

 May 1961, President Kennedy sends 400 American Green Beret "Special Advisers" to South Vietnam to train South Vietnamese soldiers to fight against Viet Cong guerrillas. One of these early "Military Advisers" was Major Neil Sheldon, code name "Redlove". He is the first to carry the W54 SADM, better known as the "Backpack Nuke"... Major Sheldon is to kill his fellow Covert Operators, President Diem and his brother Nhu of South Vietnam, but when he is ordered to kill Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia he sets up an elaborate double cross and fakes his own death. At the time of the assassination of South Vietnamese President Diem and American President Kennedy, there are 16.000 "Special Advisers" in Vietnam!
