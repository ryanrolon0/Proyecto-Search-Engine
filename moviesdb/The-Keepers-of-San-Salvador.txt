The Keepers of San Salvador

 On the remote island of San Salvador live two lighthouse keepers that operate one of the last kerosene lit hand powered lighthouses in the world. The keepers live in identical houses next to the lighthouse and even through these two people have lived and worked next to each other for years they barely speak. The senior keeper, Joyce Hanna, is retiring in 3 weeks while the other keeper, Isaiah Lightfoot, is on vacation at home, leaving Miss Hanna to work the 12 hour shift through the night.
