The Directed By

 Somewhere in America, on a campus dedicated to the art of film production, there is one who stands on a set and dreams of greatness. His name is Wylie Gladstone. Against the better wishes of his professor, he is going to make his "diner" scene the way he wants, but presently the "waitress" is missing. Then Joy McKinley, the stage manager, walks in and informs him that ten minutes is all he has left. A second later his "waitress" calls and says she won't be able to make it. Panic sets in as he realizes that his grand vision is quickly fading away. Wylie must act quickly.
