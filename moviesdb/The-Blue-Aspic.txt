The Blue Aspic

 When Jasper Ankle, the lonely janitor at the Opera, first hears the voice of beautiful understudy Ortenzia Destino, an emptiness in his heart is filled. When the lead is mysteriously murdered Ortenzia takes her place on stage, and from there becomes a famous diva. As Ortenzia's star rises her life becomes increasingly unbearable. Not only is she expected to compromise her integrity, but everyone she seems to get close to ends up dying a gruesome death. Jasper cannot stand idly by as Ortenzia suffers, and will go to any length to save her.
