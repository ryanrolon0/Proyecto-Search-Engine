Sex Crime Panic

 Based on Neil Miller's searing non-fiction book of the same name, the true story of a young girls abduction and the ensuing hysteria that led to the unjust (and absurd) incarceration of a group of gay men in Sioux City, Iowa in 1955. Following their lives in and out of the insane asylum to which they were sentenced, and tracking the mystery of the child's disappearance, the film looks bravely at all aspects of our humanity, fear, love, loss, shame, secrets, and the ways we find joy in even the most horrible of circumstances. A stark reminder of how quickly the world can turn, even today. It is a film that remind us that our past is not so distant, and our mistakes are ever-present.
