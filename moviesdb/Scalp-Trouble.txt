Scalp Trouble

 General Daffy Duck's fort is plagued by Indian raids. After struggling to awaken Porky Pig for his turn at guard duty, Daffy is terrified by an onslaught of Indians. The day seems lost, until Daffy inadvertently swallows a box of bullets... General Daffy Duck commands a fort. His troops are a sorry looking lot; one of the sorriest is Porky, who proves very difficult to awaken, until Daffy climbs into bed with him and breaks the bed. The Indians launch an attack on the fort on horseback; Porky sees it first and tells the other soldiers, who are sleeping; the last "soldier" in line is an Indian who has scaled the all. The attack is on. An Indian drinks "fire water" and breathes fire, carving an Indian-shaped hole in the fort's wall. Porky fires a cannon, whose recoil keeps jamming him against a barrel. A short Indian uses the bow legs of a tall one to fire arrows. A soldier keeps score to "Ten Little Indians." Porky, having switched to pistols, calls for more amm..amm..bullets, and Daffy races to comply, but he stumbles, swallows a box of bullets, and starts spitting them like a machine gun; Porky puts him to use and makes short work of the invaders, who carve "Yanks Beat Indians 11-3" into a mountainside as they escape.
