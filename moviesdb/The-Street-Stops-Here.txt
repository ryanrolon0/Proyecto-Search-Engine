The Street Stops Here

 The Street Stops Here is a portrait of the nation's best high school basketball coach, Bob Hurley, Sr. and his career-long struggle to inspire and motivate those around him in order to keep the doors of a poor, inner-city Catholic school open. This is a story about teenagers fighting their way out of the 'hood, armed with little more than a basketball and the hard wisdom of a fierce, demanding coach. For 35 years, Hurley has led St. Anthony his way. He's an uncompromising teacher who demands perfection from kids who've known little discipline growing up on the streets of Jersey City. His methodical, yet volatile style works miracles. He's tallied 900-plus victories for a school that's won 24 state championships. Hurley's sent all but two of the hundreds of players he's coached to college, a feat that truly shows what matters to him most. This season, Hurley faces challenges that will test his resolve. The most talented senior class he's ever assembled, with six seniors headed to Division 1 schools, is about to graduate without having won a state championship - something that has never happened to one of his teams. Even more dire, a financial crisis threatens to close the high school he's dedicated his life to. Intimate and inspiring, The Street Stops Here is the story of a man's lifelong commitment to improve the lives of inner city kids and save the poor high school that gives them hope.
