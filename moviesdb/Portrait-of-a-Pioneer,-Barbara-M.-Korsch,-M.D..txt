Portrait of a Pioneer, Barbara M. Korsch, M.D.

 Groundbreaking physician and pioneer, Barbara Korsch, developed the definitive study of doctor/patient relationships. A maverick for over 80 years, her compelling narrative takes us from a daring escape from Nazi Germany to life in the United States where, as a young physician, her fight with the medical establishment began. We learn through interviews and archival footage how she persevered despite overwhelming opposition.
