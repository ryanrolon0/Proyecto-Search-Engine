Royal Wedding

 It's July 1981 and the Royal wedding is about to go ahead. In a small Welsh town where her fifteen-year-old daughter Tammy has organized a street party Linda Caddock, recently made redundant and married - when pregnant with Tammy - to wannabe singer and all-round dreamer Johnny, fears for the future. Neighbour Alan wants her to run off with him and she's tempted even though he's no more realistic than Johnny. A shocked Tammy,seeing her mother with Alan,offers sex to a visiting disc jockey whom Linda sends packing. Next morning Alan's wife tells Linda she knows the score and the two women bond. Linda will now make a decision for her future.
