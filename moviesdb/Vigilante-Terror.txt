Vigilante Terror

 Pinetop is being terrorized by masked vigilantes, secretly led by saloon owner Brett, whose chief lieutenant is mine manager Gene Smith. After a gold robbery, suspicion is planted on Matt Taylor, who has a daughter, Lucy. Tack Hamlin comes to town and meets his old friend Strummer Jones. Moved by a sense of justice, Tack and Strummer save a man from mob justice after a saloon killing and Tack is appointed sheriff by Mayor Winch. Later, Tack and Strummer save Taylor from being hanged by the vigilantes on the false robbery charge, and Lucy provides evidence that points to Brewer and his gang as the gold thieves. But Brett charges Tack and Strummer with the theft and the vigilantes gather to hang them.
