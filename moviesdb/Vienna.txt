Vienna

 This is a promotional short for the feature film _Mayerling (1968)_ (qv). We get a behind-the-scenes look at the shooting of some crowd scenes and guests dancing at a large ball. The director and cast appreciate the fact that the Austrian government allowed the production company to film in the buildings and use the actual objects used 80 years before by the persons portrayed in the movie.
