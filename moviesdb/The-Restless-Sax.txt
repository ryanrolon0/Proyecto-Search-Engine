The Restless Sax

 Krazy sends off for mail-order music lessons; he gets back a saxophone and an instruction book (we actually follow the mail going both ways) . His first attempts are so bad the saxophone tears up his diploma. He pours honey into the sax, and it improves, barely. Using his new talent, Krazy is rejected in turn by his goldfish, a street band, all the houses in a neighborhood (even the outhouse leaves, holding its nose), a saloon, and finally a woman drawing water from a well.
