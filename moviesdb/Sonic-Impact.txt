Sonic Impact

 When a deranged criminal is caught, he is then being transported by plane, along with some other criminals. Through a stroke of luck he is able to subdue the Federal agents assigned to bring him, free the other criminals, and take over the plane. He then threatens to crash the plane into a populated area unless his demands are met. The FBI agent who captured him then decides to get on the plane while in flight to do something. He does but things don't go as planned, and the criminal continues his plan to crash the plane unless the agent can do something, the military is going to shoot the plane down.
