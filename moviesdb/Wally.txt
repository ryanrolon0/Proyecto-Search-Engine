Wally

 "Wally" is a film named after a middle-aged man, who in spite of a mental disability since birth, has made a life on the land he loves surrounded by neighbors and family who care for him and help to support him. Wally is an extremely engaging character, and we learn about his history, his interests and struggles as the film unfolds. It is also the story of his sister, Cassie, who when crisis strikes is forced to try to resolve difficult decisions concerning the future of her brother as she tries to manage pressures from other relatives. It is a film about a woman trying her best to care for a disabled brother. It is also a film about the vicissitudes of family, common to everyone dependency and autonomy-- the dilemmas from which none of us can escape. It is a film about the enormous complexity of loving and being loved. Cassie's and Wally's story is told from a viewpoint that is both compassionate and generous. Perhaps, more than anything, this is a film that invites all of us to reflect upon our own humanity and capacities for finding our way in situations that offer no "good solutions," those times in a life when we feel forced to choose the way "of least suffering." It is a film about the implications and ramifications of those terrible choices we all eventually must face.
