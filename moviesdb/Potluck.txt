Potluck

 Gail is a mother clinging to her psychedelic past where love beads were cool, peasant blouses were high fashion and pot was the recreation of choice. Some things in her house haven't changed. Her daughter, Talia, is a little more conservative, yet loves her mother immensely. Talia's marrying Jason, a man significantly more conservative than his mother-in-law-to-be. A police officer with a romantic streak, he's about to become a member of a family he, surprisingly, knows little about. While Jason and Talia share their thoughts about the wedding over lunch, Gail is holding a quilting party of another sort. With her friends Cathy, and mother/daughter Irene and Heather, she's decided to make her daughter's wedding present. The four women spend the afternoon quilting, chatting and unwinding with a little help from Gail's magical wooden box. As two conversations in two different locations meld into one, a rehearsal dinner restaurant is found and a quilt, with a unique design, is finished. Can Talia and Jason have the wedding of their dreams, when saying 'I do', means asking the mother of the bride to, 'just say no'.
