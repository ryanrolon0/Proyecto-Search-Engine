Vinashak - Destroyer

 Jailer Lankeshwar is suspected of corruption and illegal weapons trading. He uses some of the jailed convicts to act as hit men for a fee, by allowing them to leave the jail, carry out their job, and then be back with a perfect alibi. When ACP Amar Agnihotri gets to know, he proposes to the Minister to permit a police inspector to pose as a convict to gain access into a prison to investigate its warden. Arjun Singh, a dashing and upright police officer is selected for the job. Amar and his superiors contrive a plan wherein Arjun will shoot Amar down with a blank bullet, and then abscond. This goes according to plan, and Arjun is apprehended and held for court. He pleads guilty, and is sentenced to Lankeshwar's jail. While in jail, Arjun finds out that Amar has been killed, and he has become a convict for real.
