Varieties

 This entry in Universal's "Name Band Musical" shorts is a hodge-podge collection of film from previous releases, and not the first nor last one done this way. The "varieties" in the title means just that as most of the acts have nothing in common reference music styles,and the primary reason it was called Jimmy Dorsey's Varieties, as opposed to Red Norvo or Herb Jeffries Vafieties, was because Cowan figured the Dorsey name would get more bookings.The surprise here is that somebody isn't doing Universal's evergreen "I'll Remember April.
