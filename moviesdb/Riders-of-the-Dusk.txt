Riders of the Dusk

 Deputy U.S. Marshal Whip Wilson (Whip Wilson) arrives in Pecostown, Texas to assist Deputy Dunbar (Thornton Edwards) in running down a mysterious raider on a white horse, who has been rustling cattle belonging to Jack Hall (Tristram Coffin) and his chief henchman Brad Bradshaw (Marshal Reed). Whip, after meeting up with his old friend Winks Holliday (Andy Clyde) finds Dunbar murdered. Later, he intercepts rustler Danny Bronson (Lee Roberts), and is beating him him a fight when Danny is rescued by rifle-toting Nora Neal (Reno Browne), whose father is serving a life term for killing the sheriff. The new sheriff, Jim Scott (Myron Healey), fiancee of Nora, arrests Whip for murder and rustling but he escapes with the aid of Winks. Whip reveals to Nora that he is a U.S. Marshal, and she tells him that Hall and Bradshaw robbed her father of his cattle, killed the sheriff and railroaded her father to prison. She also reveals that she and Danny are stealing back the cattle that rightfully belong to her. Whip, Winks and the Sheriff go into action against the Hall gang.
