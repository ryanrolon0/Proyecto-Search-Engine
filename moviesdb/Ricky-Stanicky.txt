Ricky Stanicky

 When three teens pull a prank and burn down a house in their neighborhood, they create a fake person to take the blame -- Ricky Stanicky did it! Twenty years later we see that they have been using this alibi to get out of every uncomfortable situation in life. When their wives force them to set up a meeting with Stanicky, they hire an actor.
