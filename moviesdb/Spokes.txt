Spokes

 Spokes follows the story of a boy and his enchanting journey for love. He lives out his fantasies through his quirky imagination. After finding the perfect flower for his crush he sets off on his fantastical mission to deliver the object of his affection. An angry French ant, a pack of nasty schoolgirls, and an old lady with a wild glint in her eye, all help (and sometimes hinder) the boy on his quest for true love.
