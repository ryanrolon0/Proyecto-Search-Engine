Sleeper

 An adaptation of the comic book centered on a man who is physiologically altered after fusing with an alien artifact. His new transferable power -- the inability to feel pain -- attracts him to an intelligence agency, who places him undercover in a villainous sect, where he falls for one of his cohorts, a woman named Miss Misery.
