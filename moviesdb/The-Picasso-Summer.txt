The Picasso Summer

 George Smith, an architect in San Francisco, is feeling "a bit flat" after completing his latest, less-than-fulfilling project for a commercial complex. George's wife, Alice, tries to cheer him up by taking him to a party of artists, but it turns out to be a gaudy, pretentious affair that leaves both of them dispirited. After a restless night, George wakes up to find himself gazing with newfound fascination at the Picasso reproductions that adorn the walls of their apartment. Overcome with admiration for a truly brilliant artist, George impulsively proposes that he and Alice fly off to the south of France to track down Picasso and thank him in person. Alice agrees, thinking the trip will prove a delightful lark. But George's desire to find Picasso turns into an obsession that starts to take a toll on their seemingly ideal marriage. The film charts the journey of a young couple to the home of Pablo Picasso. The film starts as a gentle travelogue but it is not long before some of Picasso's disturbing imagery is thrust upon the screen.
