Venice Love Story

 A comedic 'love story' between an innocent and unsuspecting older man and a vulgar high school girl in pig tails. When he refuses to illegally buy her a beer, she wins her way to his heart as she ruthlessly attacks and stalks him down the sidewalks of Venice, California. In the end, they may not get what they need, but at least everyone gets what they want...Beer.
