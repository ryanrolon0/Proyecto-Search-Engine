But do a scaffold builder from the countryside and a car salesman from Beijing, representing the other social strata of Chinese society, share his belief in the Chinese Dream? The Chinese Bubble shows how class differences motivate a country to move forward in uncertain times. It unravels the delicate dynamics of Chinese growth and reveals the sacrifices of the people who are making it happen.
