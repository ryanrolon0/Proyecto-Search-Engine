Sisai

 20-year-old Sisai, Ethiopian immigrant in Israel, lives with his adoptive family - the Gavros. Father Gavro returns from Ethiopia with news of Sisai's biological father's whereabouts. Confused by the news and the fresh confrontation with his past, Sisai does not share his family's excitement. He is too busy with his own news; Sivan, his girlfriend, is pregnant. The director, who is also Sisai's brother, joins him and their father on a journey to Ethiopia on their search for identity, blood connection, love and longing.
