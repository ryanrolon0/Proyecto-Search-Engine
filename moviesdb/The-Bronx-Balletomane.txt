The Bronx Balletomane

 Joey appears to be just a regular guy from his Bronx Italian neighborhood. He's tough, works two jobs, and hangs with the fellas'. But a lifelong secret has always separated Joey from the rest. His passion for Ballet. The BRONX BALLETOMANE is the father/daughter dramatic comedy of Joey and Giselle, two tough souls from the Bronx, as they overcome their inner fears and take an unexpected step into the world of ballet. A step that will forever change their lives.
