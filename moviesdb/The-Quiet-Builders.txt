The Quiet Builders

 The lives of John D. Rockefeller the 3rd and Shigeharu Matsumoto, their 50 year friendship, interrupted but not destroyed by the war, and the vital projects they worked on together to cement a lasting two-way relationship between the United States and Japan. Their life exemplifies the idea that the relationship between countries is built upon the relationship between their peoples, and through examining their life and friendship this documentary presents an opportunity to consider the challenges facing the present day United States, engaged around the world with unfamiliar cultures and customs forced to come to grips with the dynamics of western style globalization.
