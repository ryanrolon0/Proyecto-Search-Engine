Reality Round-Up

 A reality tv producer strikes it big when he discovers why people love watching reality tv - it makes them feel better about themselves - watching people who are more pathetic then they are. After a few flops using superheroes as the stars of his show, he finally makes it big with "The Everyday Life... of Super Heroes."
