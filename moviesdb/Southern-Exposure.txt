 A young Chinese-American woman is forced by her family to go to pharmacy school, despite her lack of interest in pursuing medicine or science. Upon graduating, she takes a job that promises a larger paycheck in order to quickly pay off her student loans. She then moves to a small rural town in the South, and hilarity and misunderstanding ensues.
