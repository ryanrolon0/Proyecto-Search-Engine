Waiting for Women

 In the remote Spanish village of Riofrio the women have left years ago. Only men are left without the slightest possibility to find a relationship. Not bearing the disastrous situation any longer, they organize a bus load of single women to come from Madrid into their loneliness. Their ideal aim is to fall in love! But having never learned how to deal with women, beside their mothers and some motorway prostitutes, the event goes terribly wrong.
