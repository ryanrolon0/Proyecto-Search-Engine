Trantasia

 Las Vegas promoters planning a review starring Jahna Steele invited transsexuals to participate in "The World's Most Beautiful Transsexual Pageant," a two-day contest from which eight or so women would be offered jobs in the review. About 20 women arrive for all-night rehearsals and the pageant itself selection of eight finalists and three prize winners. We follow the women backstage and get in-depth profiles of six from LA, San Francisco, San Antonio, and Columbia, South Carolina. We meet their families, and we learn about their lives and their journeys of self-discovery and acceptance.
