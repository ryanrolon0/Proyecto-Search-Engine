The Ballad of Betty & Joe

 Every morning Betty tramps alone through the city to join her fellow buskers in the pedestrian tunnel below, trying to earn a living. But her earnings are meager and to make things worse, the new security guard, Joe, is trying to confiscate her fiddle. While Betty dreams of fame and fortune, Joe dreams of earplugs - something's got to give.
