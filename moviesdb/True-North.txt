True North

 When private investigator Truman North reacts, as any other father would, to not one but both of his daughters being hurt by his ex-wife's new boyfriend he is immediately dragged into a mystery of his own. The boyfriend turns up dead, his alibi goes missing and after a series of unfortunate incidents, he and his bumbling defense attorney wind up on the run as they try to piece together the events that led up to the death and Truman's implication.
