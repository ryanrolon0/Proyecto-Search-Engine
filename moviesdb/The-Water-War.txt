The Water War

 Ed Newton gets into trouble with the ranch men as soon as he starts surveying for a big dam. Tom Daniels rides up and informs him that Bill Dolan, one of the wealthiest ranch men, wishes to see him. He goes and is told by Dolan that the work must be stopped at once. Dolan tries to impress upon Newton, but without effect, the fact that his reservoir meets all the requirements. Here, Newton meets Margaret, the ranch man's daughter. After the surveying has been completed and the work begun, the arrogant ranch men attack the workers of the dam, in which battle Ed Newton and Bill Dolan are seriously injured. Hostilities having ended, the injured engineer is cared for at the Dolan home. During his stay there, he and Margaret have fallen in love, much to the disgust of Tom Daniels, who thought that he would be the one to win her hand. So Daniels swears revenge.
