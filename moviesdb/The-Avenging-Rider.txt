The Avenging Rider

 On his way to help his ex-partner, miner Sam Trotter, Brit Marshall is tricked into helping Trotter's murderers get away with Trotter's gold bullion. Arrested for Trotter's murder, Brit and his comical sidekick Ike escape and begin to track down the killers to clear themselves. Clues as to the whereabouts of the bullion appear when torn corners of a playing card are found on each killer's person, leading to the identity of the gang's silent partner, one of the town's leading citizens.
