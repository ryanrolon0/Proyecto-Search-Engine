Song for Robbie Miller

 Robbie Miller has dedicated his life to music. But as he nears his mid twenties, he starts to wonder if maybe his band peaked in high school. After he unwittingly triggers his grandmother's stroke, Robbie is forced to face the responsibilities of adulthood. With grandma moving in, Robbie has to help her with speech therapy and his alcoholic party mom forces him to get a job. To make matters worse, Robbie's boss is insane. He spends the day showing off his monumental turds and obsessing over teen queen Mindy McNeil. Meanwhile Robbie's girlfriend, Casey is going through a transition of her own. She is beginning to realize that, despite her high school fantasies, Robbie's band is not going to rich and famous any time soon. The party lifestyle is finally catching up to her. Overall, the film is an exploration of maturity or lack thereof, as Robbie begins to realize, in light of the dysfunctional people around him, he may be more grown up than he realizes.
