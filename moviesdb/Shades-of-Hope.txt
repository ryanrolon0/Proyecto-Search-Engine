Shades of Hope

 "Shades of Hope" is the story of two wars; the war in Vietnam and the war at home. Upon returning home from his first tour of duty, Danny finds himself welcomed with contempt for his part in a war he was forced into. Abandoned by his family he re-enlists back into the conflict with no intention of returning home. All hope seems lost until a new recruit named Max joins his squad. Max's naivety and zeal for life help Danny discover what he'll need to survive this conflict and ultimately this world - Hope. This is a story of a different type of family with an uncommon bond.
