The Valley of Fear

 Arn McGraff competes with eight other backwoods survivalists for the prize in the Valley of Fear where his father mysteriously disappeared. One of the judges is enforcing the rules with an ax, everyone is cheating, another contestant is channeling an Indian spirit guide who is bent on teaching the ways of pleasing nine women all the time to everyone she meets, but the real problem is that the valley is haunted by a monster, a raven spirit trying desperately to re-inhabit the body of its long-dead shape-shifting shaman. One by one, the Raven tries each survivalist on for size, with painful and messy results, and Arn must use all his skills to save his girlfriend and escape...will anyone survive...?
