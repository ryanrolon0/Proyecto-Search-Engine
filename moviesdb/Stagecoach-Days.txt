Stagecoach Days

 When Tom Larkin is killed his stage line goes equally to cousins Breezy and Mary Larkin. Ringo is after the line but Breezy intercepts his impersonator Virg and reports to Ringo as Virg. When Ringo learns he is the real Breezy, he bribes Monroe to authenticate Virg and Breezy is arrested just before the big stagecoach race for the mail contract.
