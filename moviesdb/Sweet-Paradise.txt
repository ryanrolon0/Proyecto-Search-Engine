Sweet Paradise

 Olga, Sarah and Mireille live a peaceful life on their own without sorrows. The only guy they need is their dumb servant, Lucien, who prepares the meals and does the shopping. Mireille, a fortune teller, is the first one who recognizes that things are going to change. She predicts that two guys and one woman will enter their lives soon and that's exactly what's going to happen.
