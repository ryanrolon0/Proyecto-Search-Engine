The Hot Karl

 For Manny Forskinn being the fifty-fifty man, "half truth and half tale makes a better sale", has become a way of life. As a writer looking to create the ultimate story, Manny seeks out what others shy away from, using confrontation and mind games to find a "story worth telling". In doing so, Manny looses his grasp of what is real or dream and disappears into a violent, sexy world where nothing is what it seems and the only motto to live by is "DON'T TRUST ANYONE".
