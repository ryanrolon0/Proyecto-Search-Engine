 We are all drawn to the amusement arcade when we are away on holiday, lured in by the bright lights, the strange sounds and the echoes of childhood. But what about the people who don't ever leave, those people who find their amusement turning to fascination, addiction or even a way of life? For most people, gambling is a form of harmless recreation; for some it is an uncontrollable and all-consuming pursuit; for others an unorthodox profession. The fact that gambling can be so rewarding also presents a significant risk for some people. There is a fine line between a passion for gambling and a gambling problem. Three Cherries attempts to get to the roots of the fascination of arcade gambling.The film explores life inside the arcade, inside the machine and inside the heads of the compulsive player and the professional.
