The Miracle of Sound

 MGM sound engineer 'Douglas Shearer' (qv) takes us for a behind the scenes look at how the sound portion of a talking picture is created. Uses _Bitter Sweet (1940)_ (qv) (a 'Jeanette MacDonald' (qv) and 'Nelson Eddy' (qv) picture) and _Comrade X (1940)_ (qv) to illustrate the techniques. Parts of this short are in Technicolor, including a stunning screen test of 'Greer Garson' (qv) for _Blossoms in the Dust (1941)_ (qv). The conclusion is a montage of trailers for coming MGM pictures featuring almost the entire MGM constellation of stars.
