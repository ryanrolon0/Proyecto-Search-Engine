The Headless Ghost

 Three college students - two guys from the U.S. and a gal from Denmark - take a day trip from London to Ambrose Castle. The earl leads the tour and references the castle's ghosts. The intrepid three hide when the castle closes to see if the ghosts are real. After sundown, in the great hall, the portraits are more than oil on canvas end to a 600-year-old curse. In the castle's deepest recesses, obstacles abound revelers entertained by a slave's dance. Can the three overcome conflicts to help a ghost get ahead?
