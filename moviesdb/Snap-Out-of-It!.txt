Snap Out of It!

 Howard, a high school student, won't show his parents his report card, because he believes he should have gotten an "A", but didn't, and now he's ashamed to let his parents know. Mr. Edmund, the school principal/psychologist, counsels Howard that high expectations are not always realistic, and when they are not met one gets "emotionally upset," which is a bad thing for a teenager in the 1950s to be. So Howard promises that he will set his sights at a much lower goal from now on.
