The Mirror Crack'd

 A town busybody is poisoned at a busy reception in the home of famous film star Marina Gregg. The poisoned drink seemed intended for Marina, but Miss Marple is not so sure. She sets out to discover the true identity of the killer before he or she can strike again... Beautiful film star Marina Gregg is attempting to make a comeback after being off-screen for many years due to an emotional breakdown and substance abuse. She is supported by her fifth husband and director of the movie, Jason Rudd. They rent a manor house in St. Mary Mead and host a reception for the villagers. A pushy, gushing fan who had met Gregg briefly before her breakdown is poisoned by a drink apparently meant for the film star. Because of Gregg's celebrity status, Superintendent Slack assigns one of his most skilled and discreet investigators, Inspector Craddock, who happens to be Miss Marple's nephew. Together they set about investigating the death threats and blackmail associated with the case. St. Mary Mead is all abuzz when aging Hollywood movies star Marina Gregg moves into Gossington Hall. When she agrees to continue the annual fund raiser for the St. John's society, many of the villagers get to meet her, including Heather Babcock who had met her once before at the end of World War II. When Babcock is poisoned after drinking a daiquiri intended for Marina, Miss Marple and her nephew, Detective Inspector Craddock, think she was meant to be the victim. This is confirmed when her husband reveals she has been receiving threatening notes. There are many who may wish her harm, including a producer who may profit from insurance if she is unable to act in his next film; the sexy film star who will replace her; and a staff assistant who is in love with her husband. As Miss Marple soon learns however, the solution to the crime is far more complex.
