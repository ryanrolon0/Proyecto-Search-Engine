Reel Life

 Takes place during one day in the suburbs, where three movie-making teens want to film at an exclusive party. They can only gain access by bringing whiskey so they enlist a stranger, a man in his late 20s, to buy them the alcohol, but he wants to participate in their movie in exchange for the whiskey. 'Reel Life' touches on media, technology and sexuality among a young male suburban culture.
