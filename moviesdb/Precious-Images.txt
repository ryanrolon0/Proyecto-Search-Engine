Precious Images

 A cross-cut of nearly 100 years of American movies. We see the most precious film sequences that we all remember Wars", from "Some like it hot" to "E.T.". The incredible short cuts of roughly a second each push the audience into a kind of trance and take them on a journey into their individual memories of great films of the 20th century.
