The Dino Beat-Up

 In this first film from 7 year old screenwriter/director/editor, Evan N. Zeiger, two boys find the impossible in their backyard while playing soccer - a Velociraptor footprint. Together, they embark on a perilous journey to find the carnivore and research its life. After a close call with a venomous snake, and an even closer call with the Raptor itself, the boys find an abandoned T-Rex egg. One of the boys must find the strength to save the other, and the egg, when the dinosaur returns.
