 After a woman commits suicide one of the teams of mental health care workers designated to help her discuss and mobilize to prevent further erratic and disturbing behavior like copycat suicides. These P.A.R.C. teams were created to prevent crisis and help the mentally ill in society. Making and taking extreme action is just a typical day for these mobile health care heroes. The question is whether or not all of these health care workers are sane themselves and to what extreme do they internalize and personalize these events and feelings?
