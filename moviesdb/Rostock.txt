Rostock

 The city is Berlin. The time is shortly after the wall came down. The place and Strecker are here for the freedom # and the empty walls. They mark the place with their graffiti art. Stephan and his pals are here for the freedom to make music. They are using a former Stasi room for rehearsal. Toben and his associates are here for the freedom too, with all their anger against the fallen regime. When they encounter Rostock and Strecker the confrontation escalates, suddenly there is a knife and someone dies.
