Speechless

 Cora has let others make all her decisions for her, preferring to live in her own fairytale dream world. On a trip with her friend she finds Todd, a southern gentleman. Taken on a ride of her life, she cannot separate the reality from the fantasy and when she finds herself on the brink of marriage she is forced to make her first decision alone.
