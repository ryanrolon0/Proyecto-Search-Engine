Return to Florence

 "Return to Florence" takes a humorous look at Anglo-American art students in romantic Florence, Italy. In an intimate school setting, they learn the painting techniques of the Renaissance period, while being isolated from modern influences. The documentary compares the students' expectations with what they actually experience, exploring as well their love affairs and conflicts.
