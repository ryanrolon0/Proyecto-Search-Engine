The Folly of Fanchette

 The lonely wife of the District Attorney believes that her husband doesn't love her anymore, as he seems too busy with work to pay any attention to her. She finds herself attracted to a seemingly nice young man named Rhodes, and soon believes that she is in love with him and makes plans to elope with him. What she doesn't know is that her new "suitor" is actually the head of a gang of thieves her husband and the local police department have been pursuing, which was the reason why he was spending so much time away from home. Complications ensue.
