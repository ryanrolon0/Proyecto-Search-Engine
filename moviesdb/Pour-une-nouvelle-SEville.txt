Pour une nouvelle SEville

 For a New Seville is the story of men and women whose identity as Arab Jews challenges the very notion of enemy. Gorgeously shot in Morocco and Israel, it is part historical investigation into the exodus that emptied Morocco of its Jewish population, part poetic and musical essay on loss and longing, on hope and the possibilities of coexistence. Were Jews expelled from Morocco, as some have claimed? What role did Israel play in the campaign to transfer Jews out of the Arab world? What happened to them when they arrived in Jerusalem? Their story exposes the double dispossession suffered by Jews torn from their ancestral homelands to help build a Jewish State, a 'homeland for the dispossessed' that ultimately rejects them unless they are willing to strip away their Arab identity.
