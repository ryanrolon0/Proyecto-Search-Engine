Victoria, George, Edward and Thatcher

 The faces of class, wealth, history and tensions between individualism and conformity in British society are explored in this visual journey from East to West London. Consisting of almost 4000 images of the city's residences taken in 2009 and 2010, the film records my daily journey from my home in Clapton e5 to Royal College of Art SW7.
