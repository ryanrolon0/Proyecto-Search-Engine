The Hollywood Matador

 The bull is watching through a knothole as the great bullfighter, Woody Woodpecker, is showing off for the spectators. Unable to take it no longer the bull dashes into the arena and charges Woody so hard that he makes a shambles of the stadium. Woody, as always, equal to the task at hand is soon serving bull-burgers to the crowd. The posters outside the bullring promise action. One says, "Woody the Terribull!" Woody Woodpecker is shown threatening a bull with a toilet plunger. Another says, "For Whom the Bull Toils." Woody is shown grinding a bull's tail in a meat grinder as the bull cries out in pain. Inside, an incongruous radio broadcaster announces that little Woody is five pounds (two pounds over), while Oxnar the Terrible is 1,100 pounds (eleven pounds under). No matter. The hulking bull is doomed to become hot dogs when he tries to match his brawn against the crazy fowl's wits.
