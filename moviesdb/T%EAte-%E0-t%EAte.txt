Tête à tête

 Jean-Francois, a musical genius from Montreal, gets lost in the big city of Toronto and quickly spirals down into cocaine addicted hell. One day he decides to sell his very last possession for drug money - his beloved cello. Surrendering to the beautiful piano strains he hears from next door, he decides to play a duet with his mysterious neighbor through the wall separating their apartments, attracting the attention of a growing audience outside. His spirits are lifted by the experience, but he'll never know that his music partner is actually a deaf old woman, lonely herself, playing the piano from memory.
