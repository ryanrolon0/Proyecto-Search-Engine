Third Girl from the Left

 The story of the other side of Hollywood in the Seventies-of what it means to be black, sexy, smart and full of dreams in a land where "blaxploitation" is as literal as it sounds. As intense and serious as it is fun and fabulous this is a compelling saga of love, family secrets and the ambitions of mothers and daughters.
