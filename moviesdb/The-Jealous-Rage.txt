The Jealous Rage

 Margie was the belle of the mining camp. A stranger came to the canyon, and the belle at last found a conqueror. Bess Harding, jealous and deceitful, found there was love-making going on in her vicinity, and that she was shut out of it. The miners did not like the stranger, and it only needed a spark to explode a tragedy. Bess supplied the spark, and in the attack on the stranger's cabin which followed, more than one man bit the dust. The sheriff's posse came to the rescue, and at the end the poor little jealous waif too, crumples up, a stray bullet through her fiery heart.
