The Awakening of Jim Burke

 After his divorced wife dies, Jim Burke takes their son who she had been raising and he hasn't seen in many years. Jim Burke is a tough, hard-nosed construction boss on engineering projects, and he is looking forward to molding Little Jim into his own image. Jim Burke is more than a little bit dismayed and a whole lot disgusted when Little Jim arrives and it doesn't take Big Jim long to figure out that Little Jim...ain't nothing but a sissy. Little Jim is fond of practicing on his violin and reading and studying. What's a poor father to do?
