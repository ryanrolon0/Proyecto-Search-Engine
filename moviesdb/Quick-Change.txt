Quick Change

 A frustrated salesman runs into his high school sweetheart on his way to work. She offers him the chance to run away with her, and he just about accepts, until he remembers he left his car at a parking meter that is about to expire. His quest is then to find quarters to put in the meter so he will give his lazy roommate enough time to get to his car so it isn't in danger of being impounded, and so he can still catch the next train to Miami.
