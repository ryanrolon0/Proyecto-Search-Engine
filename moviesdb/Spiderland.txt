Spiderland

 "Four childhood friends are struggling to grow up. Coming to terms with their 'individuality'. Some say evil. Others say antichrist. But they just want to be good boys... Addictions aren't easy to kick, especially when you're constantly looking over your shoulder..." - Welcome to Spiderland.
