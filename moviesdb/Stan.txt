Stan

 Priscilla and Georgie have travelled hundreds of miles looking for Stan Something. Priscilla is an intolerant woman who desires to be needed. Georgie is a self-conscious, retarded, 8 year old boy. The two end up in the veteranian office of Dr. Andy Burnside, a man who was severely burned in a tragic car accident as a child, causing him to withdraw from people for fear of rejection. When the three come together, the story unfolds and they each end up finding something to like about themselves (in addition to saving a dog's life in the process).
