Rethinking Cancer

 Rethinking Cancer is a provocative new documentary that presents a compelling look into the therapeutic and psychological journeys of five men and women who chose to use non-toxic, biological therapies to overcome serious illness. All of the patients profiled have been disease-free from 15 to 37 years. They are representative of a large pool of well-documented, long-term survivors who sought guidance from the Foundation for Advancement in Cancer Therapy and its then president, the late Ruth Sackman.
