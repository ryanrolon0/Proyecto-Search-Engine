Spoilers of the Plains

 This is an odd one for Roy. There are foreign spies, desert sites for rocket-launching and artificial satellites. The climax is a one-on-one fight on top of an oil derrick. Roy runs a pipeline and near by is a rocket missile site. Camwell is after one of the missiles and to gain access to the site, steals oil from Roy's pipeline to sell. When the next missile is fired, Camwell is ready. He finds the missile, takes the data box, and replaces it with explosives set to go off just as the missile is returned to the site.
