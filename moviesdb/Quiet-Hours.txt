Quiet Hours

 Things could not be going better for Adam, a young, talented actor. The day before he opens as Hamlet, Adam makes a stop at 7-11 to grab a snack on the way home from rehearsal. As he leaves the store, however, he notices that there is more than just a receipt thrown into his bag with his snacks. Inside his bag, he finds a slip of paper with a Dewey decimal number on it. Intrigued, he follows the number to the nearest library, where he is led to a mysterious book. After opening the book, however, he discovers that he has lost the ability to speak.
