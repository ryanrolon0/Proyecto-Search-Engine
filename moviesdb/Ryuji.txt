Ryuji

 This is an excellent piece of cinema, about life of yakuza (gangster) and his family. Ryuji tries to quit yakuza and spend a decent life with his wife Mariko and daughter Aya...but as he's used to getting easy money, it'd become hard for him to work hard and get little. Eventually he's back to where he belongs.
