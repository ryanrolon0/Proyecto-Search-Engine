Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!

 Light-hearted, old-style romance about a farm-hand who arranges to buy a pair of mules from his employer. No one is able to handle the mules and he must train them. Adding to his dilemma, he pursues his boss's daughter who gets her kicks out of keeping him guessing about her true feelings. Of course, at the end he tames both the mules and the girl. Two antagonistic stepbrothers live on a mid-western farm with their mother. One of them takes a job as a hired-hand with a neighboring farmer with whose daughter he is in love, although the daughter appears to be more than a little bit distaff toward him and her father offers no encouragement nor no endorsements reference the courtship. The young man buys two mules in order to add to his income, and his jealous stepbrother attempts to disable the mules but is foiled. Later he uses the two mules to rescue his employer from a quagmire, and the latter gives him permission to marry his daughter.
