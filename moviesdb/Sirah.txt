Sirah

 For Sirah, a young Muslim girl raised in America, the private academy she attends is a lonely place. Sirah stands apart from her classmates because of her religious practices, specifically the covering of the head and body. This changes when she meets Amy, who opens the possibility of friendship. However, not everyone is as understanding, and ultimately, Sirah is pressured to choose between her family's beliefs and the culture which surrounds her.
