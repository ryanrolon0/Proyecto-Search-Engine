Sleep Happy

 An exhausted Woody is walking the streets looking for a place to rest. He happens upon Wally Walrus' bed & board which welcomes boarders. He enters Wally's house, settles into bed, and sets his alarm. Unfortunately, Woody tends to be a noisy roommate with his constant snoring, chuckling, and moving about. Wally tries to silence him by all means possible but all attempts fail until, finally, the alarm goes off, the sun rises, a rested Woody leaves, and Wally has had one heck of a sleepless night.
