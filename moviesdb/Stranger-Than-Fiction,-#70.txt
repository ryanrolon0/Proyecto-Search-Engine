Stranger Than Fiction, #70

 This entry in the series covers unusual occupations, beginning with a Philadelphia pants-presser, Dominick de Gregorio, who shows an amazing model of the Delaware River he made of balsa wood; then a wild-horse roundup in Nevada, and a man in Louisiana who raises thousands of alligators as a hobby and, while in Louisian, the camera takes a look at a giant oak that is 35 feet around with a root spread of 168 feet. The short concludes with a look at a new invention for tomato pickers that is amusing as well as practical and, finally, the world's champion bubble blower blows some bubbles.
