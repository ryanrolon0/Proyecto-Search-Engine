The Loan Stranger

 Woody is happily (and nuttily) driving down the street when his car breaks down. He tries to get a loan on it from a nearby wolf. The wolf agrees to give Woody the loan but exclaims if he doesn't receive payment in thirty days, he'll take Woody's car away. Sure enough, a title card tells us, "Thirty days have elapsed (and so has Woody's memory)". The wolf appears at Woody's door trying to serve him with a notice but the crafty woodpecker pretends he's not home. The wolf tries to trap him disguised as a deliveryman giving Woody a cake... but the woodpecker throws it in his face bellowing, "I don't like cheesecake!" Finally, the fox throws a punch at Woody and believes to have seriously injured him. He sympathetically agrees to forget about the loan only to be infuriated when Woody "recovers" holding a cuckoo clock and asking, "How about a loan on the clock, Doc?" Woody Woodpecker crashes his car just outside the Sympathy Loan Co. Their slogan Woody one buck (that's what is printed on the bill him that if he doesn't pay it back in thirty days, he'll repossess his car. He adds an evil laugh for dramatic effect, but he is upstaged by Woody's tires which pick that moment to explode one at a time. Thirty days later, Woody has forgotten all about his loan. But the loan officer, of course, has not. "Loan shark" would be a more suitable term Woody with a bill for $366.50. At least, he tries to present it. The wily woodpecker decides it's best if he simply refuses to answer the door. But the greedy, scheming wolf can't be put off that easily.
