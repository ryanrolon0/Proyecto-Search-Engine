The Sky's Gone Out

 The Sky's Gone out is a tale of alienation in the modern industrialized world, that dampens the very things that give life to a soul. The world is becoming a machine, both in it's mechanical presence and the way in which we live our lives within it. Culture, nature and purpose are being replaced and eradicated. This film follows the thoughts of one person who recognizes this... but is it too late?
