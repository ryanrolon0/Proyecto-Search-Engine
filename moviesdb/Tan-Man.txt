Tan Man

 Enzo is a hard working guy who works in his uncles tanning salon. One day his uncle Joe asks Enzo for a favor; to pick up a package of illegal tanning lotion that he invested money in. Uncle Joe tells Enzo that if he does this he will pay for Enzo's school. Enzo reluctantly agrees and gets a few helping hands from his friends on this little journey. Trying to make this easy pick-up, the guys begin to realize that they got themselves involved in something much bigger, and more dangerous than they previously thought.
