Understanding Jane

 Two men (Kevin McKidd, John Simm) in London decide to meet women by answering a dating ad. They meet two women (Amelia Curtis, Louisa Milwood) who use the ads to scam men out of cash, gifts and food. One immediately sees through the women's ruse, but the other becomes infatuated with his date and continues to pursue her. She in turn tells her friend that she is just playing him for bigger plans. The film turns on whether she has actually fallen for him or if she continues to be a user. Elliot and Oz meet two girls, Dallas and Popeye, and go for a restaurant meal. Oz and Popeye hit it off, but the girls do a runner before the bill arrives. The guys arrange a second meeting, and manage to turn the tables. After their third meeting, Oz nd Popeye settle into an (apparantly superficial) relationship whilst the film concentrates on Elliot and Dallas spending time together and learning about each other.
