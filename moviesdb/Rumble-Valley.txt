Rumble Valley is a film that attempts to emulate satirically the predominant stereotypes of the classic American genre films. The film tries to bring elements from Western, Film Noir, and 50's drag racing films together on screen. The films goal was to push these stereotypes to the extreme by removing any sensor that would have previously restricted the action and dialog of its characters. Foul language, perverse dress, and semi-automatic pistols are all employed to further this effect.
