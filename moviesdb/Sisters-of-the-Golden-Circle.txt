Sisters of the Golden Circle

 Two pairs of newlyweds are riding on a bus when the wives notice the strong resemblance between their husbands. Mrs. McGuire realizes there's a police detective's car following the bus and hatches a plot with Mrs. Williams to switch their husbands' identities long enough for Pinkey to escape from the police.
