Socks and Cakes

 Five people of different ages, backgrounds, cultures and tastes find themselves at a dinner conversing with each other about their lives and where they see themselves in the future. Some deeper, hidden secrets emerge and just when it seems all is to be revealed...all is still kept secretive. Socks and Cakes is a bitter dramedy, written and directed by Antonio Padovan, about the relationships between five ordinary people of different ages, backgrounds, cultures and tastes that find themselves together at a dinner party in Greenwich Village. Harry is a misanthropic French literature professor who is just taking his life one day at a time, getting by with just enough to survive. His ex-wife Amanda is now married to Harry's best friend, Richard, an architect. Both seem to put on a positive front that all is well with their marriage, but Amanda has her doubts and Richard has a wandering eye, especially when he meets the free-spirited, innocent, Sophie. Sophie has come to the party with her current boyfriend, the older and always grinning real estate broker, David.
