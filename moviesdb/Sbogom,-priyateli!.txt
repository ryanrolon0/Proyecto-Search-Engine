Sbogom, priyateli!

 Boev, an enthusiastic form master, is trying hard to establish rapport with his final-year students. His frankness, buoyancy and good nature soon make him a universal favorite. The only one who does not approve of him is headmaster who loves his job, but is not aware of how dated his own views are and cannot understand the young teacher. Apart from this, Boev comes in into particularly sharp conflict with his colleague and childhood chum Kiril who is consumed by jealousy and the ambition to get promoted quickly. He is consciously adapting himself to the headmaster's dogmatic views thereby losing the trust of his students. Two conflict views of the teacher-student relationship clash against the background of school routine and in the electrified atmosphere on the eve of the graduation ball. One is the narrow, purely educationalist approach which does not teach the students anything about human nature, while the other maintains that they should receive a much broader training which should prepare them to cope with real-life situation as thinking adults.
