The Eternal Void

 The Eternal Void is a four minute film about life, the inevitability of death, and what love's got to do with it. When an astronaut finds himself detached from his space station and drifting into the depths of space to die alone, he confronts the existential void face on. But when he spies another astronaut on her own trajectory into the eternal void, his hope for lifelong companionship is renewed. A silent film with a score by jazz musicians David French and Andrew Downing.
