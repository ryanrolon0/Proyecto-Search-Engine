The Candid Camera Story

 This short chronicles, in a semihumorous way, events associated with MGM's 1937 convention for the studio's national sales and distribution staff. First the delegates arrive by train in San Bernardino, California, where they change trains for Pasadena. Passengers are shown talking and singing on the train. When they finally arrive at the studio in Los Angeles, they are greeted by 'Louis B. Mayer' (qv), then go to one of the sound stages for dinner.
