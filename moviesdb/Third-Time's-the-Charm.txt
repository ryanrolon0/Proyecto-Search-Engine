Third Time's the Charm

 Third Times the Charm is a short mockumentary about a young Asian filmmaker named Fernando who grew up in San Diego's primarily Caucasian East County. Rejected from an Asian film festival two years in a row, Fernando makes a third attempt by making an action movie embedded with his Asian roots. This is a movie about cultural identity and what it means to truly be Asian.
