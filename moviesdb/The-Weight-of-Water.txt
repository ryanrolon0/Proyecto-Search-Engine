The Weight of Water

 A newspaper photographer, Jean, researches the lurid and sensational axe murder of two women in 1873 as an editorial tie-in with a brutal modern double murder. She discovers a cache of papers that appear to give an account of the murders by an eyewitness. The plot weaves between the narrative of the eyewitness and Jean's private struggle with jealousies and suspicions as her marriage teeters. A newspaper photographer travels to a New Hampshire island with her husband, brother-in-law, and his girlfriend to investigate an 1873 axe-murder of two Norwegian women, in which she finds her own relationships paralleling those of a woman who survived the crime.
