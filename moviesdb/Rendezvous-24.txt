Rendezvous 24

 In a remote, mountainous section of Russian-occupied Germany there is an elaborate post-war Nazi underground dedicated to the achievement of Hitler's dreams of world supremacy. A group of scientists are working on a method of releasing atom bombs through remote control. The FBI learns of the plot and sends an operative (William Gargan) in to foil it.
