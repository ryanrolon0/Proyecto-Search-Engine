Wayward Son

 A Southern man in the Depression tries to pick up the pieces of his life after being wrongly imprisoned for eleven years. He is befriended by a farmer whose daughter is emotionally and physically frail because of scarlet fever. A murder triggers the town folks' emotions and forces the ex-con to prove his innocence to escape a lynch mob.
