Tôkyô jôkû irasshaimase

 Yuu Kamiya is an up-and-coming talent in Japanese show business. She is killed in a traffic accident. On the way to heaven, she gets a chance to transiently restore her body (to which mirrors and photos are insensitive) and comes back to this world. She starts new life as an average girl. Yuu, a young campaign worker is accidentally killed when she attempts to fend off the sexual advances of her general manager. In the afterlife, Yuu convinces her guide to allow her to return to earth. With nowhere to go, Yuu arrives at the apartment of advertising executive Fumio, who, coincidentally, is the one who has to cover up the circumstances of Yuu's demise to prevent a political scandal.
