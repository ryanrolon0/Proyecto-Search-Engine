Two Rembrandts in the Garden

 The documentary follows the Englishman Mark Atkins in search of both his Jewish past and the family treasure which his father had told him about and has been an object of familial fascination for decades. At the old family house, however, Mark finds the way to the long sought-after treasure blocked. The family residence is now under the control of the Polish military, and Polish military intelligence are operating a laboratory on the site where the treasure is hidden. The hurdles Mark and his now arriving family have to face seem insuperable, but he never gives up, sometimes blurring the line between legal and illegal, all the hopes of finally unearthing the family treasure.
