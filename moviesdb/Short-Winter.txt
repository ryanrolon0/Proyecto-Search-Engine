Short Winter

 The city is heating up. The traditional Midwestern winter has vanished; it has not snowed in Chicago for nearly ten years. So when three inches of fresh powder appear one Saturday morning, two youth venture out into a desolate park on the city's West side. Vonte, 17, and Samuel, 10, are long time neighbors, but forces beyond their control threaten to destroy their friendship and fracture their community.
