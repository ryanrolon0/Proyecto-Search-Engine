Seen Also in Men

 A documentary about the paternal instinct three fathers hold that pushes them to fight for meaningful relationships with their children. Under the weight of broken relationships with their own fathers, the negative stereotypes of what a black father does not do, and the injustices in the family court system towards willing fathers; these men rise to the occasion for the love they've felt since they knew their children were on the way.
