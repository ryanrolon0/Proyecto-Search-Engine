The New Shooting the Chutes

 Undoubtedly the finest chutes in the life motion picture is here produced. The cars are seen to ascend slowly, but to descend so rapidly as to excite the onlooker. The famous Joe Columbia makes a slide for life on a slackwire, from the top of the chutes to the other side of the water, a distance of several hundred feet. Seals are plainly seen swimming about in the water dodging the cars as they descend, and finally as one car strikes the water one of the occupants jumps overboard and swims leisurely to shore. It is safe to say that this new "shooting the chutes" is without exception the best on ever taken, from every point of view, and is exciting in the extreme from start to finish.
