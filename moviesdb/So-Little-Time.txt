So Little Time

 In Belgium, during World War II, a young music student and her mother are the only ones left of a large family, the men having all been lost in the war against Germany. Their château is partially taken over by the German Military Commandant. The girl, Nicole, has an intense hatred for the Germans and tells the Commandant, Hohensee, so. Whey they discover they have a mutual interest in music, especially the piano, they come to know each other better and fall in love. They know it is an impossible situation - especially the girl who is forced by the underground to steal documents and information from him - and realize their romance can only end in tragedy.
