Shades of Truth

 A documentary about the present times of war five viewpoints. The common link people together on screen, we ask them the questions everybody is struggling to answer and in turn try to raise the consciousness of everybody who watches them speak. There is no judgement here, no right or wrong, only opinions and the need to see a better world without terrorism and the war against it.
