Water Cycle

 Water Cycle is a short buddy comedy about two roommates whose escalating, life altering pranks force them to evaluate their relationship and priorities. Parallel to their prank war, the two men chase two 'unattainable' women, and find that their immaturity comes with consequences. Their friendship is pushed to the limit, but endures through the temporary fog that has settled between them. In the end they seem to have learned their lesson, or so we thought.
