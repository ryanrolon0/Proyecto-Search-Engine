Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal

 Ganga (Lakshmi) is raped as a college girl when she accepts a lift from a stranger on a rainy evening. Shunned by her family, she is taken in by an uncle who lets her continue her education, get an office job in the city and start life independently. One day, she chances upon businessman Raghu (Srikanth) who had raped her years ago, and embarks on an unusual relationship with him. Somewhat unusal plot, taken from a popular novel, with good performances from Lakshmi and Sundarabai playing her long-suffering mother.
