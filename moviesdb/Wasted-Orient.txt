Wasted Orient

 Joyside leaves Beijing on their first nationwide tour of China. An American filmmaker, whom the Bass player refers to as a "horse-face" in the end credits, accompanies them to prove that China is not ready for rock n' roll and that in its current state-although humorous-is a nightmare for the youth trying to build its interest. There are scenes of dog being consumed but only after thousands of beers which appear to be in almost every shot of the film.
