The Ballad of Mulla and Mullins

 Journey through the soul of a hitman with a mind teetering on psychosis that brings a genuine empathy for the humanity of a killer and a coming of age story of two boys growing up in 1930's London to become ganglords, like brothers only to have their lives end bittersweet.
