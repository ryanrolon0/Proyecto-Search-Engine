Theogony

 Eve, a genetic scientist, battles with her husband, Adam, over the moral responsibility of Doctors playing God in the attempt to bring dead cells back to life. THEOGONY engages moral theological questions and forces us to take a look at our historical past, our religious present, and our scientific future.
