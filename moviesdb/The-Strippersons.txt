The Strippersons

 Eugene is about to make is stripping debut. He's rehearsed and bumped and grind-ed and dusted his hoo-hoo but he's still terrified. A lot is resting on his under-developed shoulders. He's the 3rd son in a stripping empire lead by his over bearing mother "Bunny." When he chokes it's a blow to the honor of the whole family. Why is Eugene so afraid? What's his secret shame? Is no thong safe in Hollywood?
