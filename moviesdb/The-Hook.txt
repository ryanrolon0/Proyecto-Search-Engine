The Hook

 A young man finds himself trapped in a room with no way out and condemned to a certain death. As he thinks all hopes are lost he finally realizes that a choice is given to him to control his fate. The resulting feeling of freedom is triggered by his ability to make a choice in his life. This feeling might just hide the reality of his existence.
