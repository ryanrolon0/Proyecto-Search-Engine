TechFellas

 "Remember GoodFellas? Well, this is GoodFellas in the computer industry! Martin Scorsese's gangster classic translates amazingly well to the world of tech support in this clever parody. The characters are all here, but they're not the mobsters you know and love - they're computer techies! Classic GoodFellas scenes take on a very different twist, as this spoof of the popular movie applies favorite moments to an I.T. department in an office environment."
