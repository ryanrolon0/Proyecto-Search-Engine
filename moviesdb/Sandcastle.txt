Sandcastle

 In an unnamed place, in an unnamed time, a man and a woman go through the motions of life, fused to each other for a reason neither of them can remember. Meandering through a withering landscape of loneliness and thread-bare self consciousness, Sandcastle is a neo-noir film that explores the futility of relationship and our inability to escape it. In this stark black and white prairie Gothic world, all desires and memories are sublimated into shades of gray.
