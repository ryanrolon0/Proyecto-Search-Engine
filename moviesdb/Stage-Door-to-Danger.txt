Stage Door to Danger

 Lacy inherits an old movie theater which, unbeknownst to her, is the hiding place for stolen goods. A detective traces the loot to the theater and thinking Lacy is part of the gang, grabs her and before the diminutive theater owner can explain, the innocent girl is gagged and handcuffed. Soon the real thief shows up, captures the detective and after toying with his captives plants a bomb to destroy the evidence - and the damsels in distress. Will the naked, bound and muzzled ladies be rescued in time?
