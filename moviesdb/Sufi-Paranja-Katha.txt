Sufi Paranja Katha

 Our tale begins towards the end of the 19th century, when the British ruled Malabar, after the invasion of Tippu Sultan. The story explores the myth of the land, the history of its people, the love and passion of the protagonists and the mystical spirituality of tolerance. The plot revolves around the love and marriage of Karthi, the Hindu heiress of a wealthy Nair Tharavaadu, with Maamootty, a wandering Muslim trader in coconuts and spices. On another plane, the film is about the transformation of Karthi to a Biwi, a local Goddess worshipped by the Hindus and the Muslims alike.
