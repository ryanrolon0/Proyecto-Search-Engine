The Earring

 Amidst an idyllic rural landscape two girls are leaving home. Drawn forward by the mythical and mysterious power of nature and each other; their movements through the forest build a mesmerizing and rhythmic tension that is severed only when one of the girls is compelled to climb a tree. The other girl is determined to stop her.
