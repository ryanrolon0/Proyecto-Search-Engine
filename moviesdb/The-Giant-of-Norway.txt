The Giant of Norway

 This short tells the story of Norwegian explorer and diplomat 'Fridtjof Nansen' (qv) (1861-1930). After a life of adventure, he was instrumental in resettling tens of thousands of refugees and displaced persons resulting from World War I. He continued this work in 1922 after the war between Greece and Turkey. The film ends by reminding moviegoers to think of the plight of contemporary refugees caused by the fighting in Europe.
