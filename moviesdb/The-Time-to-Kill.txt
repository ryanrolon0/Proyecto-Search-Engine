The Time to Kill

 After the infamous terrorist Dmitri Koskov kills an American agent, the CIA sends their best man, Jacques Ryen, after him. Hot on his trail, Ryen soon discovers that Koskov is just the tip of the iceberg in a massive political conspiracy. Left without anyone he trust, Ryen must decide for himself where his true allegiance lies; in his friends, his government, or his country.
