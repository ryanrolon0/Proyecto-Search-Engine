Subculture Artisans

 Two documentary film makers, working from a commission by Channel 5, attempt to shoot the episode of their cultural programme "Subculture Artisans", on the infamous Director X. A man so mysterious that the authorities are helpless at finding him. He is the man with the highest body count in snuff film history. However, as Director X takes the two documentarians into his world we discover he is nothing more than a bungling clown desperate to make mainstream films. As the staged deaths become more ridiculous, tragedy results as the hapless Director X accidentally electrocutes his entire crew and cast. The documnetarians put together an expose on Director X and reveal him to the world, via Channel 5.
