Through the Neighbor's Window

 Every town has its troublemaker and the view the neighbor has from behind lace curtains is often strangely distorted. Herbert Spencer and his wife, Lillian, have two such neighbors and they very nearly cause trouble for the young couple. Lillian goes away on a few days' visit with her mother. Herbert, as a surprise for her, invests in a dressmaker's form that she has been wanting. He has the form delivered to his home, but intercepts the drayman in the parkway leading to his house, escorts it to the door. To be cute, he dresses the form with one of his wife's wrappers. From their windows the neighbors see him with the strange woman entering his house; they scent a scandal and try to find out more. In the morning they see Herbert go off alone, so rush over to his house to investigate. Receiving no answer to repeated knocking, they peer in the window and there. to their great horror, they see a figure on the couch covered with a shawl (where Herbert has left it). Scandalized, they decide to write to Lillian, hinting at strange goings on. When Lillian receives the letter from her neighbors she is mentally disturbed and with her mother immediately returns to her home. At the sight of her husband her anger subsides and she would have be en pleased to fall in his embrace, but the stern mother reminds her that things are not as they used to be and poor Herbert gets rather brutal rebuke. In the house the figure on the couch first causes consternation and then amusement. The neighbors call to offer their sympathy, met with a stern rebuke and depart with dampened spirits.
