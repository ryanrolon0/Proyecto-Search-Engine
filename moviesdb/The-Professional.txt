The Professional

 On the surface this is a fairly typical situation that plays out everyday in typical American life. What you don't see, what is hidden from our day to day observations is just how deep the weathered lines of the subjects face run. The stoic quality he carries in his eyes, mirrors that reflect all that might have slipped away and what has been fought for . Coupled with the living character of his decades old shop, his story resonates as an affecting portrait of a very distinct form of American perseverance, one that proves her sense of ingenuity and survival is far from lost. A deeply personal project for all involved.
