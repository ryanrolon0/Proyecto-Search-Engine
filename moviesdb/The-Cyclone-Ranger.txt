The Cyclone Ranger

 Cattle rustlers try to go straight, but find that trouble continues to follow them. They eventually wind up at the ranch of a blind woman who thinks that one of them killed her son. As the Pecos Kid and pals Pancho and Juan flee from the Sheriff, Juan is killed. Juan was returning home after a long absence and when the other two arrive, Juan's blind mother mistakes the Kid for her son. Unable to tell her the truth they stay on. But there is trouble when the Kid's former partner arrives and threatens to expose him unless he is allowed to rustle the old lady's cattle. A remake of 1933's "Gun Law" starring Jack Hoxie also written by Oliver Drake, and was remade several more times including Republic's "Gauchos of El Dorado, 1941" with the Three Mesquiteers. The Pecos Kid (Bill Cody) and his pals Pancho Gonzales (Earle Hodgins)and Juan Castalar (Donald Reed) are being pursued by the law, and Juan is killed.Juan's blind mother (Soledad Jiminez)owns a rich ranch across the border, and Pecos and Pancho go there to tell her about Juan, but she mistakes---blindness is not her only handicap--- Pecos as being her son who has not been home for, evidently, a long, long time. Pecos goes along with the masquerade, to ease the Mother's pain, and things are moving along rather well until Duke (Eddie Gribbon), the leader of a gang that Pecos ran with shows up. Duke sizes up the situation and decides that, in order to keep Mama Salazar from learning the truth,the best thing Pecos can do is help him and his henchies make off with all of the cattle.
