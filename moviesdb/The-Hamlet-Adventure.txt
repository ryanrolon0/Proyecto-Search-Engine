The Hamlet Adventure

 Obsessed by Hamlet's tragic character since adolescence, writer-producer Stanislav Semerdjiev ventures to write and stage a new post-modern monological version of the famous plot at the peak (8000 feet) of the most mysterious Bulgarian mountain. For the implementation of his crazy dream he gathers a multinational team of 70 and secures the rights for music from the cult composer Mark Snow (X-Files, Millenium, Smallville). After nine years of ordeals the desperate bunch surprisedly finds out that the "mission impossible" has actually lead them to a new understanding of the meaning of life, both similar and opposite to that of Hamlet.
