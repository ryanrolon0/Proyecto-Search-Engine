Project Huxley

 Huxley is a monkey. He is imprisoned in a lab, forced to take part in a 'Monkey typing Shakespeare' experiment by a sadistic lab assistant. Secretly he harbors dreams of playing Hamlet. Can Huxley escape from his tormentors and realize his theatrical dreams? Who says a monkey can't play Shakespeare?
