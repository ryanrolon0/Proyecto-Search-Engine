Popeye

 The evil Brutus is at it again. This time he's after Olive Oyl. So as Popeye, you must survive many levels of fury, dodging the evil Brutus, Sea Hag, and Bernard the Vulture. Brutus's bottles and Sea Hag's hopping skulls will slow you down, but obtain your spinach and send Brutus to the moon and win Olive Oyl's hand in marriage. He's strong to the finach, cause he eats his spinach, he's Popeye the Sailor Man- and he's on your Nintendo!
