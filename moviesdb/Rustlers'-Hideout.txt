Rustlers' Hideout

 Bringing a herd of cattle to Dave Crockett, Billy halts before going through the pass where many herds have been rustled. He is right as there are two men after Crockett's ranch and packing plant which will be theirs if Crockett fails to pay off his note. When their attempt to get Crockett's son in financial trouble is broken up by Billy and their men fail to rustle the herd, they then poison the water hole.
