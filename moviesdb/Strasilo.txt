 A scarecrow feels lonely. The crows come down, but misunderstand him and run away, afraid. He chases after them; one of them gets injured, and he binds up the bird's wing, and eventually convinces the crows that he wants to be their friend. They take advantage of him for a while, then reach some agreement.
