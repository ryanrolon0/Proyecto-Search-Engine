The Hair in the Soup

 An elderly gentleman of generous proportions is seated at a table in a cheap restaurant, and from the contented expression on his face, he is enjoying his lunch immensely. His evident content, however, is suddenly brought to an end by his swallowing a hair which has strayed into the soup. After a number of coughs and sneezes he succeeds in locating the troublesome article and expresses his disgust in a most ludicrous manner. A most amusing subject and a marvelous exhibition of facial expression.
