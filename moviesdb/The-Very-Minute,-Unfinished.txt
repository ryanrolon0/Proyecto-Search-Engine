The Very Minute, Unfinished

 Images are shadows. Haunting memories are shadows. Migrants who cross borders are shadows. Passing minutes are shadows. Sparkles of light that come from the deepness of the night are shadows. A film made of 7 fragments all inhabited by the idea of disapperance, absence and survival.
