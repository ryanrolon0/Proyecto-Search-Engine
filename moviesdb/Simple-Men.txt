Simple Men

 Bitter about being double-crossed by the women he loved, (and with the police after him to boot), Bill vows to seduce the next woman he sees, then throw her away. His brother Dennis, meanwhile, is equally determined to track down their long lost father, a revolutionary who has been in hiding for 20 years. For different reasons, both leave New York and head for Long Island, out of money, and short on ideas. D moraine." B recedes." D Bill McCabe, a vaguely misogynistic ne'er-do-well who has just been double-crossed by his girlfriend during a heist, is reunited with his younger and more reserved brother Dennis on a quest for their father. Along the way they encounter a lonely bar owner with whom Bill falls in love, an epileptic young woman with a big secret, a psychotic ex-husband, a bitter sheriff, and several other colorful characters. This "road movie with a twist" aims to explore men's attitudes toward both women and themselves.
