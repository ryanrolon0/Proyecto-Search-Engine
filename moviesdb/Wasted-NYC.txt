Wasted NYC

 Chrissy, compassionate friend to all, bartends her way through Grad school in New York City. When Chrissy's best friend has a big problem, Chrissy is a lifesaver. But when being the life of the party takes over Chrissy's passion for helping others, she is forced to face her own problem. WASTED NYC explores the gray areas of addiction in a city where drinking is highly accessible, acceptable, and celebrated.
