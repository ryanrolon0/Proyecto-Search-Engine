Sealed Cargo

 During the war off Nova Scotia a fishing boat comes across a badly damaged Danish schooner with only the captain aboard after it has apparently been shelled by a German U-boat. Not realising the sinister real purpose of the larger boat, the fishermen agree to tow it into an isolated harbour. During World War II, Pat Bannon's whaler sights a shell-ridden Danish four-rigger in the waters off of Newfoundland. The crew has fled and only Captain Skalder is aboard. Thinking it has been a victim of a German U-boat, Bannon agrees to tow the vessel to a small Newfoundland port, the destination of the whaler's sole passenger, Margaret McLean. During the voyage it becomes apparent that one of the whaler's crew is a Nazi agent. In port, Bannon and Conrad, a crewman who proves loyal to the Allied cause, discover the the vessel they aided is a U-boat supply ship.
