Spelling Bee

 A dark comedy about a judge who becomes increasingly inappropriate during the final round of play. He drinks, swears and chooses words for competition that mark the lowest moments of his miserable life. His definitions are inaccurate and his example sentences reveal his personal failures and shortcomings.
