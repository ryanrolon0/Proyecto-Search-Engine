Rock 'Em Dead

 After making a deal he soon regrets, teen metal head, Nick Martin finds himself stuck between loyalty to his fellow band members and the demonic record producer, Lucius DeMion. In this twisted comedy of diabolical proportions, the filmmakers pay homage to "Tales from the Crypt" and other popular cult television shows and films.
