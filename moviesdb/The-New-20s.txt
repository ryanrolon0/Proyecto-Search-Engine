The New 20s

 10 years after college, Chrystal Winters Myers wakes up and realizes her life has changed. Instead of the wild dreams she had for her future in her youth, she finds herself over 30 and in a passionless marriage with a writing career that is going nowhere. As she looks at her friends from college, she realizes that they too are going through transitions of their own. Now all in their 30's, they are navigating through life's trials and triumphs and dealing with real world issues they had not faced in college, or even in their 20's. Chrystal defeats her writer's block when she decides to use her friends as subject matter in a new book titled 'The New 20s".
