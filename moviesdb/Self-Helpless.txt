Self Helpless

 John Candy is convinced that he is the ultimate ladies man and the world's greatest DJ, despite the fact that he works at a gas station and lives with his father. The Drake is a disgruntled pothead landscaper who lives with his bitchy, overachieving girlfriend. Even regular trips to his weed dealer, The Dude, can't keep The Drake from getting frustrated by his situation. Felix is a budding entrepreneur who is sick and tired of his job in a law firm. His ultimate goal is to make it big with a porn site he is running. Simon is a failed birthday party magician with more than a few screws loose. Self Helpless is the story of these four friends and their hair-brained search for enlightenment. These easily misguided young men each pursue a different self-help trend, always ending in disaster. During a poorly timed acid trip, The Drake has a vision in which he realizes that the answers he and his friends have been looking for lie with the Don Rodrigo, an all knowing Mexican guru. The boys realize that they must seek out the Don Rodrigo at all costs. After liberating Felix from his job, and a few inspirational speeches, the crew is headed south of the border where they encounter gangsters, drugs, guns, explosions, and some awesome parties. Prepare to be laughing on the edge of your seat.
