Sojourn

 Jim Ronan, a failed hockey player, heads to his small Minnesota hometown in search of the accolades and admiration he once enjoyed there. He goes there to heal his body and to rebuild his shattered image. But what he realizes when he gets there is that not everyone still believes in his dream. His father, the retired player now family doctor; his mother, sick with cancer; and his ex-girlfriend, the kindergarten teacher at the local school have all moved on forcing Jim to come face to face with himself and his troubled past before he can decide if he still loves hockey.
