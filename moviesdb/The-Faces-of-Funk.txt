The Faces of Funk

 Karen Davis, the now famed publicist, was a reporter for "Soul to Soul" magazine in the '70s. She was the last person to interview the band while they were out on tour in 1979 with "Cameo" and "Con Funk Shun". Karen was allowed back stage in Atlanta before and after the show and got some great stuff from most of the members. Answers to questions that many of the fans wanted to know. Although she has been offered much for the footage, she has held on to that footage until this film.
