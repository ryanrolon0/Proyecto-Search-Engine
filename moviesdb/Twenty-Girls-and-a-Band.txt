Twenty Girls and a Band

 Nick Stuart and his band masquerade as an all-girl band as part of their plan of getting to play at a dance at a swanky girl's-only school. They get away with the masquerade and their playing is successful but they are discovered and have to hitch-hike their way back to the city in feminine attire.
