Taan

 Maki is a young nursery teacher and talented copper plate printing artist. One day she's hit by a truck and awakes on a deck chair in her house in the empty city. She seems to have died and experiences the same day every 24 hours. One day the designer Yohei, who has bought the rights for one of her copperplate paintings for a book cover, calls Makis phone number and is able to talk to her. Is there a way to the afterlife?
