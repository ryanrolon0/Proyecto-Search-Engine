Pyasachen chasovnik

 The film is an anti-fairy-tale. If normal fairy-tales begin with "Once upon a time", this one has to start with "Once upon a no-time". The heroes of this anti-fairy-tale are a man and a young woman, who used to be classmates a long time ago. Their present meeting is neither accidental, nor wished for, but it happens to be fatal, because love comes. A little bit odd, as a matter of fact. But is there ordinary love? Especially when it is reared with the prose of Lyudmila Petroushevskaya. She insisted that the most important thing is to keep the sorrow of the story.
