Quest for Glory II

 And so the Hero of Spielburg journeyed with his new friends to the desert land of Shapier for a well-deserved rest and change of scenery. But dark clouds are brewing in the kingdom of the desert. The Sultan has locked himself in the palace, rarely seeing the people of his kingdom. Strange things have begun to appear in the desert. And Rasier, Shapier's sister city far to the south, has had its Emir overthrown and it's beauty lost. What sinister forces are behind this terrible evil? What evil magic has spawned the four Elementals to attack Shapier? Once again, the hero must spring into action, and discover the truth, before the evil that is slowly consuming the land takes him as well.
