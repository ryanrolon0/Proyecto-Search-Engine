Tegla puna vazduha

 Some time before the 2000's state elections, in a small mining place, workers led by Svetozar decide to go on strike. Some are unwilling, while others are in apathy and just do what Svetozar wants. They spend their days in front of the only shop around, drinking bear and lamenting over their fates. Some are unhappy with their wives and families or the lack of women around, some have PTSD from the Kosovo war or other health problems, and some are desperate because of small wages and bad working conditions. When they hear that shop-girl's husband had left her, they will become interested in her as well.
