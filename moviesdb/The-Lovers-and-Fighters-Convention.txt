The Lovers and Fighters Convention

 The Story of one night at London's Transfabulous Arts Festival. In 2004 in the UK, the Gender Recognition Act came into law giving new rights to transgender people - the act itself dividing gender along binary lines. In the wake of the act, many couldn't locate themselves in the new boxes or even tick one. This film charts performers who re-imagine what gender could mean in the wake of "the act."
