 In 2005 Afghanistan had their first democratic election after the war. We follow political active Malalai Joya in her trial campaign to get elected. Due to her pointing out several Taliban warlords wanting them prosecuted for their crimes against the Afghan people, she has since been exposed to several death threats over the last few years, and has been under constant protection. But in her home county she is regarded as a national hero and has great support for her political endeavor. In September 2005, Afghanistan held its first parliamentary elections in 35 years. Among the candidates for 249 assembly seats was Malalai Joya, a courageous, controversial 27-year-old woman who had ignited outrage among hard-liners when she spoke out against corrupt warlords at the Grand Council of tribal elders in 2003.
