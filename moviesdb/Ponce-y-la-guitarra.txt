Ponce y la guitarra

 This movie was filmed in the house and studio of the Mexican composer Manuel M. Ponce, and it constitutes a journey through the personal atmosphere of the composer, its piano, the guitar music he wrote, and the phonographic archives of this great figure of the Mexican music of the twentieth century. Our guide through Ponce's house, almost in ruins, is the guitar player and composer Juan Helguera, a tenacious investigator of Ponce's ouvre for guitar.
