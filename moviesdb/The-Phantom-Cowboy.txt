The Phantom Cowboy

 Stan Borden with the help of the stooge Sheriff is out to get the Toreno ranch. Kicking the peons off the ranch, they kill Miguel's father. Miguel then becomes the masked El Lobo and when Jim Lawrence arrives, the two team up to fight Borden and the Sheriff. After the death of Don Jose Toreno ('Leander De Cordova' (qv)), his ranch foreman, Stan Borden ('Milburn Stone' (qv)), steals a copy of his will and learns that Toreno has willed his entire holdings to his niece, Elanita Toreno ('Virginia Carroll' (qv)), his foster son Jim Lawrence ('Don 'Red' Barry' (qv), and to the peons living on the Rancho at the hour the will is read. Borden, with his accomplice, Sheriff Ben Jeffers ('Rex Lease' (qv)),plans to drive off the peons and murder Lawrence before the will is read. Then, he will marry Elanita and gain possession of the Rancho Toreno.
