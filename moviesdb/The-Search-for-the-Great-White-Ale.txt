The Search for the Great White Ale

 It is a sad day in Meadville after Derf the Viking has drunk all the town's mead. With the guidance of Loki (the trickster god) he hopes to redeem himself by finding the Fountain of the Great White Ale and returning with its supreme brew. Will Derf be able to overcome the River of Fire, the peaks of Mount Stupidity, and the depths of the Sea of Gullibility?
