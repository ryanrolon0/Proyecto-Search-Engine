The Census Taker

 George and Martha Day (Greg Mullavey, Meredith MacRae) are a typical suburban couple who live in the peaceful neighborhood of Appleton located above Los Angeles. Harvey McGraw (Garrett Morris) is the census taker who's in charge of checking the community's population. The Days willingly invite McGraw in, but the simple questionnaire turns more personal that it angers the couple and they accidentally shoot him in the forehead. They are then forced to hide McGraw's body and remove any evidence from their guests, one is an detective. Before long, the detective discovers the body and George and Martha's future is in jeopardy.
