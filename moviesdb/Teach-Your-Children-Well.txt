Teach Your Children Well

 Every school day thousands of young people who identify as either lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans-gender face harassment, bullying, and even violence for simply being who they are. The documentary film Teach Your Children Well focuses its attention on the challenging issues of homophobia and school violence as directed against our L-G-B-T youth. Our primary goal with this project is to expose the effects of homophobia in our schools and to encourage acceptance and respect for the right of others to be and express who they are.
