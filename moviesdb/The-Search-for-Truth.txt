The Search for Truth

 The relationship between science and religion is examined (in the style of the Bell Telephone TV shows from the same era) using historical re-enactments and the statements of eminent scientists (illustrated with animation). Was the creation of the Universe and life all due to chance, or by divine plan and direction ? The Mormon viewpoint is given, that the Earth was divinely created for mankind to inhabit, with all men having dwelt with God before birth. Men must gain mortal bodies to prove themselves worthy to return to the presence of God as they struggle and search for truth. Religion gives impetus to the quest for answers in science, and to answer our questions about our origin, purpose, and existence after death. Science supports true religion.
