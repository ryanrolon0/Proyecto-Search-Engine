The 18th Electricity Plan

 Timid Mr Curtin cycles below sea level to begin his first day at work at the mysterious Ministry. He's determined to succeed and so prove himself worthy of the beautiful Miss Kennedy. But when he's waylaid by a sinister colleague, Grieves, Mr Curtin starts to realise how little he really knows about what goes on at the Ministry. Mr Curtin is drawn into a disturbing game in which his hopes become playthings for the malign Grieves.
