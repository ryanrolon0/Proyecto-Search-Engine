Profumo di Lumia

 In the Sicilian town, Scillichenti, the women smell like lemons, and are too beautiful for the young men to be able to think straight. When the young protagonist, Gioele, realizes he loves them all, he tries everything to win them over. He sets out on a journey that takes him behind Mt. Etna, underneath the Mediterranean and into himself.
