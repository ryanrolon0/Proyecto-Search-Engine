Solo für Schwarz - Tod im See

 Former profiler Hannah Schwarz gets personally involved in this tale of murder and guilt. Is her new friend, psychiatrist Karl Hoerster, responsible for the death of his daughter, and was he behind the disappearance of his wife some years earlier? Hannah's investigation is complicated by the unexpected appearance of a former boyfriend who blames her for the mess his life has been ever since she left him 25 years ago.
