Sanjay

 Sanjay Singh lives in a middle-class family. His father, Ranvir, a retired constable; his mother is a housewife; his elder brother, Pratap, is married and has one son; and his sister is yet to marry. Ranvir's philosophy is to accept bribes and this is what he teaches his constable son. But Pratap prefers to be honest. Sanjay meets with and the falls in love with beautiful Saaxshi, who is the daughter of the Deputy Superintendent of Police. Then things go well with the Singh household, Pratap gets promoted to the position of Inspector, and a political leader gives the Singh family a bunglow to live in. The family is all set to enjoy a comfortable life, when Sanjay discovers that all this luxury and comfort has come to them at a price - a price that each of the Singh family will have to pay collectively and individually.
