Tattered Dream

 Set at the height of The Great Depression... A dramatic love story about a Negro League baseball player who sustains a career threatening injury after rescuing a white woman and her child from a horrifying accident. The choice he's forced to make between the love for her or his dream to return to baseball and shatter the color barrier brings about an inner struggle against the social realities of that time.
