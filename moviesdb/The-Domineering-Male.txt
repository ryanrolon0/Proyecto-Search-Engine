The Domineering Male

 A couple kisses; he's just proposed, and he believes he was the aggressor throughout the courtship. But, back up a few months, and, with the help of an off-screen narrator, we see Gertrude in control of just about everything from the start -- from giving up alcohol, cigarettes, and chewing gum, to hiding the fact that her braid is a hairpiece. Will the guy figure out she's just after security? The narrator tries to tell him and even suggests a little trap. Will Gertie be exposed?
