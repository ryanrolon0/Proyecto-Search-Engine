Sonny Boy

 Actress-Director Soleil Moon Frye's second work "Sonny Boy" focuses on her often troubled relationship with her father actor Virgil Frye who suffers on Alzheimer's disease. From the beginning of his career as a makeup artist on the set of Easy Rider, his work as a Elvis Presley double in New Orleans and his political support for the civil rights in Alabama to his work on the cornfields in Iowa and his Golden Gloves boxing championship Frye accompanies her father to re experience their past on a journey through the states. The longer their trip lasts, the more Mr. Frye's disease seems to worsen. Therefore it gets more and more difficult for both of them to cope with their lives and memories.
