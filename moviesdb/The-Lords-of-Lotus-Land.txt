The Lords of Lotus Land

 As technology evolves, so does society, so does organized crime. If you don't keep up you will be left behind. The Lords Of Lotus Land are stopped at a major cross-roads... keep with tradition or modernize. Talk of a new morality? Whispers of a changing of the guard? The Lords stand face-to-face with the monster of their own creation. Subdue it or be devoured by it? All they know is nothing will ever be the same again.
