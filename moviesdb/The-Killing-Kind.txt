The Killing Kind

 Jack, a hapless drifter with a penchant for card playing, is released from jail and returns to town to pay off an old debt. He is reunited with Tuesday, a desperate widow with a secret. Tuesday sees Jack's arrival as an escape from the clutches of Frank, a smalltime gangster. But loyalties are put to the test and more than one person ends up dead.
