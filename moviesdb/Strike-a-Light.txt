Strike a Light

 Twenty years of sexual-sentimental adventures of a woman accompanied by hits from the 70's to the present. One protagonist, whose story is told in the first person by eleven different women. From suburbs to the city, from tattoos & psychedelic paraphernalia to piercings & cell phones in search of the right man. After a series of encounters/confrontations with men who all seem to possess a similar trait - that of not being right for her- the protagonist has nothing to lose
