Tango Bayle nuestro

 Impressionistic look at the tango in Argentina, mixing dance sequences with interviews, archival footage, and atmospheric fictional scenes. The narrative discusses tango's place in Argentine identity, its decline in the 1950s, attempts in the 1980s to revive it, differences between the tango in Argentina and in other countries, its healing properties, the distinctive roles of man and woman in the dance, and contrasts between professional and amateur styles. The archival footage includes some of the mid-twentieth century's best known dancers.
