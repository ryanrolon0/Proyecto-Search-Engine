Predator X

 Deep in the Polar Arctic, the discovery has been made of a completely new species - a giant sea monster with the head of a T-Rex, a fifty-foot-long body the shape of a giant whale and huge flippers - making it the largest and fastest prehistoric sea creature ever to terrorize the oceans. Up until now the very existence of this creature during the Jurassic period has been completely unknown to science.
