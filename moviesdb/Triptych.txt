Triptych

 Derek, Julia, and Ian are three 20-somethings building individual paths to destruction. Derek, an outspoken college drop-out, is focused on perfecting philosophical arguments and sleeping late. In the meantime, he's losing hold on his relationship with Julia, a nine-to-fiver who is unfulfilled with her life as a cog in the capitalist machine. Derek's best friend Ian seems to be the most contented in the trio, but it's his struggle with his own identity that will stun everyone, and turn the lives of all three upside down.
