The Making of Indiana Jed 'Behind the Scenes'

 This made-for-video documentary treats comedy and independent movie fans to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Indiana Jed, a spoof (although the makers see it more as a rip-off) of the Indiana Jones movies. Includes interviews with producers Michael and Marc Linn, along with other members of the cast and crew, who describe what inspired them to create this piece of work, and share some of the experiences they had in the course of bringing the film to completion.
