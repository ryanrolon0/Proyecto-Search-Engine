The Sound of Laughter

 Ed Wynn narrates this compilation of short subjects produced in the 1930s by Educational Pictures. Educational's talent roster included young performers on the way up, older stars who were still popular, and Broadway and vaudeville headliners. This feature offers a representative sampling from all three categories. The clips are not identified, but the major sequences are taken from GRAND SLAM OPERA and ONE-RUN ELMER with Buster Keaton, THE HITCH HIKER with Harry Langdon, HOTEL ANCHOVY with The Ritz Brothers, DREAM HOUSE with Bing Crosby, POPPIN' THE CORK with Milton Berle, MONTAGUE THE MAGNIFICENT with Bert Lahr, GOING SPANISH with Bob Hope and Leah Ray, THE INVENTORS with Col. Stoopnagle and Budd, GLAD RAGS TO RICHES with Shirley Temple, and CUPID TAKES A HOLIDAY with Danny Kaye. Shorter clips appear from the Educational shorts MR. WIDGET, DATES AND NUTS, THE BASHFUL BALLERINA, MILLION DOLLAR MELODY, SHE'S MY LILLY, WAY UP THAR, ALL-AMERICAN KICKBACK, and TWO LAME DUCKS, among others.
