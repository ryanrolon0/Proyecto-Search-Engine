Walking Through Fires

 What is real?, What is not?, What is really important? Based on the true story of illusionist Mark O'Brien. A renowned master of illusion, O'Brien is closing in on achieving his dream of opening a magic attraction in Orlando, Florida when two suspicious fires, five days apart, cripple his production company. Investigators call it arson. Pressure mounts as he rebuilds his company, and he discovers that a similar attraction is now under construction. Determined to find out the truth, O'Brien hires two private investigators to get to the bottom of things. They are arrested as they begin to uncover what they believe is a 'major cover-up'. O'Brien tells his story to his life long friend 'Dave' who visits Mark on a business trip.
