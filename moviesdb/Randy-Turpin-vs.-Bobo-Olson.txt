Randy Turpin vs. Bobo Olson

 This short features the October, 1953 Middleweight Title Fight between Britain's "Randy" Turpin---never fighting as Randoplh Turpin, even in his 1951 bout with "Sugar Ray" Robinson---against Honolulu's Carl "Bobo" Olson. Bill Corum was the ringside radio-announcer. Round One was Turpin's highlight round in which he landed a few punches that did no harm to Olson. The latter shuffled around with Britain's pride-and-joy for a few rounds, and then turned aggressor from Round Five onward. Olson knocked Turpin down for a nine-count in Round Ten and, while Turpin fought strongly in rounds 13 and 15, Olson kept the British champion on the ropes and won the decision, and the Middlewight title, from both judges and the referee.
