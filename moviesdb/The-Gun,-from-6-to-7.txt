The Gun, from 6 to 7

 "The Gun", a new film by internationally acclaimed director Vladimir Alenikov, is a quite unique. Filmed in real time (90 minutes) and shot in only fifteen scenes with no cuts' the complex choreography and brilliant camerawork puts the audience in the middle of the action and makes the actors' performances look absolutely natural. Innovative and compelling, "The Gun" is far more than a frantic dash through the seedy alleys and strip clubs of Los Angeles - it is a journey through the minds of people so desperate in their pursuit of happiness that they are ready to kill for it.
