The Warrior and the Sorceress

 The mighty warrior, Kain, crosses the barren wastelands of the planet Ura, where two arch enemies, Zeg and the evil degenerate Balcaz, fight incessantly for control of the village's only well. Kain sees his opportunity and announces that his sword is for hire...but his eyes stay clearly on the beautiful captive sorceress Naja, and his newly awakened purpose. A powerful warrior named Kain, skilled in the use of many weapons, discovers two worthy opponents while traveling through a small village. There he also encounters a ravishing sorceress. His holy warrior gig now over, Kain roams the earth as a mercenary, selling his unequaled skill at arms to the highest bidder. He'll find plenty of work in the village of Yamatar. The commoners there are exploited or enslaved by a pair of rival warlords named Zeg and Bal Caz, who spend most of their time struggling for control of Yamatar's well, just about the only thing of real value for thousands of square miles. Kain may be just a sword for hire these days, but the old Homerac in him is rankled by what he sees in the village, and just for the hell of it, he decides to bring down both tyrants.
