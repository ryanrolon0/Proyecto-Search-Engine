Singing in the Dark

 Leo is a holocaust survivor who suffers from total amnesia; he comes to the U.S. and works as a hotel desk clerk. One night while a comedian, who owns a bar in the hotel, gives him a drink, he breaks out in song and discovers a great voice. Under a psychiatrist's treatment, and because of a blow to the head by some hoodlums, he realizes his name is David and that he was the son of a great Jewish Cantor, and gradually recovers his memory of losing his parents. He gives up a promising career singing in nightclubs to return to the synagogue. This important and virtually unknown independent film is one of the very first American feature films to focus on the Holocaust. A concentration camp survivor (Moishe Oysher) emigrates to the United States and suffers amnesia due to the traumatic experiences he has endured.
