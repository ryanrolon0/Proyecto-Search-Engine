The Bibulous Clothier

 The proprietor is standing in front of his impromptu outdoor second-hand clothing store. A well-dressed man appears and is measured for a coat. The proprietor finishes measuring, takes a drink from his bottle, looks at the customer and finds he has increased in size. He drinks twice more and the customer grows larger each time. With the fourth drink, the customer returns to normal. This is too much for the proprietor and he falls to the ground in a faint.
