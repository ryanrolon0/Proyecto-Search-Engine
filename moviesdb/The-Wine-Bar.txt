The Wine Bar

 On a winter night in New York City, an average guy, Henry, wanders into an upscale wine bar looking for a beer. Obviously out of place, Henry innocently offends both the snooty Bartender and Evelyn, the pretty young woman quietly reading next to him. When Steven, Evelyn's hotheaded boyfriend, comes in looking for a fight, Henry decides to take matters into his own hands.
