The Law Comes to Texas

 Dean, the Bailey County Judge, is the boss of both the outlaw gang and the Sheriff. He utilizes the state law that Sheriffs have jurisdiction only in their own county. After a raid the gang merely returns to the safety of Bailey County. The Governor sends Lawyer John Hayes. When he has no success as a Lawyer he leaves town only to return disguised as an outlaw with a scheme that will nab all the culprits.
