Slingshot

 By fate two diverse souls meet in the desolate hills of Afghanistan. One is Zaed a 13-year-old Afghan boy, who calls upon Allah for guidance during some harsh times. The other is Frank (35) a Canadian soldier who has morally lost his way. Now at this destined meeting they find their salvation in each other.
