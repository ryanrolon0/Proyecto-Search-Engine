Spiel mir den Osaka-Blues

 On his quest for enlightenment a Japanese samurai crosses the beautiful Bavarian landscapes on his horseback. Enthralled by the beauty of the lands he dozes off in meditation only to wake up to the fact that his horse has been taken by four mean Bavarian butchers and made into sausage. That's when he draws his blade to turn the butchers into sausages in return.
