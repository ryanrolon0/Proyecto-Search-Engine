Ride of the Mergansers

 Ride of the Mergansers brings to the screen the challenging life of the hooded merganser, a rare and reclusive duck found only in North America. Produced by U.S.-based Steve Furman, the film takes audiences to the Great Lakes region where, within 24 hours of hatching, tiny ducklings must make a perilous leap to the ground from the safety of their nest high in the trees.
