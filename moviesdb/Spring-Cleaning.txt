Spring Cleaning

 A chillingly layered family drama, Spring Cleaning explores the sometimes devastating responsibilities of adult children and the bizarre and psychotic methods with which the main character chooses to deal with those responsibilities. Although Leticia resolves the immediate problem of how to care for her dying mother, the film does not necessarily resolve who, in the final analysis, will take care of Leticia.
