Starter Home

 Taking a light-hearted look at inter-cultural romance, this is the story of two lovers looking back at a failed relationship. Flashing back from present time, we pick up with the pair 5 years ago as they are looking to buy a house. A quirky, hapless Realtor (Kathy Kinney, THE DREW CAREY SHOW) attempts a hard sell of the bank-owned 'starter home.' In the course of looking at the house, the cultural rift between the couple becomes evident and widening. Returning to present day, we see the two struggling to believe in the happiness and cultural parity of their new chosen partners, haunted by a past that proved love wasn't enough.
