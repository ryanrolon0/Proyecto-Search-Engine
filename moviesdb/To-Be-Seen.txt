To Be Seen

 A study of visual culture, of urban culture and an exploration of an age-old urban cultural phenomenon, street art. This form of art, that is not a commodity (there is no price tag), that is ephemeral, and that tends to address current political and cultural issues, is examined as a form of public expression, a form of media and a means of political and social protest.
