The Secret of Oz

 What's going on with the world's economy? Foreclosures are everywhere, unemployment is skyrocketing - and this may only be the beginning.

The yellow brick road (the gold standard), the emerald city of Oz (greenback money), even Dorothy's silver slippers (changed to ruby slippers for the movie version) were powerful symbols of author L. Frank Baum's belief that the people - not the big banks -- should control the quantity of a nation's money.
