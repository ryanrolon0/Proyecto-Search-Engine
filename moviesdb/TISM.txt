TISM

 Australian band TISM ("This Is Serious Mum") are about to disband. With the aide of a telethon running on stage during their concert, their fans, unsuspecting callers and "special guests" attempt to raise $1,000,000 in order to keep the band together. Spanning three discs, The White Albun is at times a concert, an album, a documentary and a retrospective of an Australian band with a 20+ year history who rarely achieved fame or recognition - if only because they didn't want to.
