We Played Marbles... Remembering a Stolen Childhood

 WE PLAYED MARBLES features eleven Holocaust survivors who recount memories of their childhoods in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, and Poland. Their stories illuminate the rich European Jewish culture that was destroyed by Nazi tyranny. They share memories of how their lives were abruptly and forever changed. They tell of loved ones who perished, and of the courageous people who helped them survive. These interwoven narratives are infused with the wisdom and strength that is born out of building new life after loss.
