The Hootch

 The true story of the 26th Marine Regiment Sniper/Scouts at Khe Sanh Combat Base leading up to the Siege of Khe Sanh, one of the longest, bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War. In the summer of 1967, a platoon of snipers set-up their bunker, their "Hootch," which would be their home for this particular tour in Vietnam. The Hootch is where they live, laugh, share their pain and joy, and relish life between missions. They play, drink, take pictures to send home, and live their lives with their brothers; and as patrols go out, some do not return. The platoon includes Sergeant Donnelly, the hard-charging leader and five-year veteran from Illinois; Sergeant Beam, from California, all spit and polish; and Corporal "Slappy G," from New Jersey, the cool professional. They embody the heart and personality of the platoon. While on patrol, they learn the base is being surrounded and the build up of troops soon becomes evident. Before dawn on January 21, 1968, while two snipers were guarding an enemy officer who had surrendered, the first bombs hit, beginning the continuous 77-day siege. This movie is not about the war, but of the young Marines who face what most people will never have to; and the Esprit de Corps that allows them to live a life that they were proud to have lived at all. Always faithful, always together, thirty-six men of the platoon were wounded or killed. This is a true story of America's youth in the 60's. It's about loyalty, friendship, honor and courage, forged like the steel of an NCO sword. This is their story. SEMPER FI.
