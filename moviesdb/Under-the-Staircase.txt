Under the Staircase

 My grandfather was innocently executed in Iran on January 4, 1982, due to religious persecution. A member of the Baha'i Faith, Iran's largest religious minority, he was imprisoned, tortured, and executed without a trial. In honor of his memory, I made a short documentary piece about the events surrounding his death.
