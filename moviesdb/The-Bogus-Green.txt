The Bogus Green

 Advance man Brass McGannon is nearly arrested for passing counterfeit money while promoting his circus' next stop. Returning to the circus, he learns that the Treasury Department suspects someone in the circus is responsible for the bogus dough appearing wherever the circus visits and suspicion falls on the show's newest employees. Meanwhile the alcoholic sideshow barker falls off the wagon when his beautiful daughter returns unexpectedly.
