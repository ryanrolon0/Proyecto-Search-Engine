Revenge of the Bridesmaids

 When Abigail and Parker return from New York City to visit their home town, they discover that their best friend Rachel is a bridesmaid in the wedding of their childhood friend, Caitlyn, and Tony, who was Rachel's boyfriend until Caitlyn interfered. Abigail and Parker decide to run some interference of their own. They manipulate Caitlyn and become bridesmaids as well so that they and Rachel can sabotage the wedding from the inside. With help from a police detective who happens to be a groomsman, the girls strive to ruin Caitlyn's wedding while dodging her controlling mother and hopefully reuniting Tony and Rachel.
