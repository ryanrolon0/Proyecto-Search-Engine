The Red Front

 Nazi Germany, 1933. The introverted WERNER STEIN, son of a prominent underground Communist leader, has no aspirations to follow in his father's footsteps. But when he and his father are arrested by the Nazis, an SS Officer forces Werner to make an unspeakable choice. Shattered, Werner is recruited by his father's underground organization, THE RED FRONT, to exact revenge. But revenge is never simple, and again Werner is forced to make a final, deadly choice.
