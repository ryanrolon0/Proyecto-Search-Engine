Sueño de un pájaro

 This film is a process of decompression, like deep sea divers. Sueno de un Pajaro shakes you from the start , with the intense image editing and music by Babasonicos. To me it evokes a wave of those images with a 'liquid' quality that come from Pink Floyd at the time Barrett. Sueno de un Pajaro is young and free, though it is a pure design for liberty that never comes. It describes a short journey between the margins of escape and sudden collapse (as shown by the scene in which James Dean falls from the banquet table).This tries to convey a feeling of fragility, that our eternal youth is dead before it begins, that in truth all we want are the simplistic things.
