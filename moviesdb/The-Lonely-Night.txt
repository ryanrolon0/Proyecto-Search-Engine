The Lonely Night

 A fact/fiction documentary financed by the U. S. Public Health Service and endorsed by the National Association for Mental Health and the National Institute for Mental Health. Lots of talky scenes in a psychiatrist's office juxtaposed with family scenes stressing the positive and negative ways of moulding a child's character. An early role for actress Marian Seldes whose Caroline character was molded by the negative ways.
