Rani of the Ring

 Kanaka Durga rejected the traditional role of an Indian woman, instead choosing to punch her way out of poverty by becoming the first female boxer in Andhra Pradesh. Fame and gold medals have led Kanaka to encourage other young women to step into the ring. This film follows Kanaka as she trains new contenders who know that behind every jab lies the promise of a better future.
