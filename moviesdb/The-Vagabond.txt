The Vagabond

 After passing the hat and taking the donations intended for German street musicians Charlie heads for the country. Here he finds and rescues a girl from a band of gypsies. The girl falls in love with an artist whose portrait is later seen in a shop by the girl's real mother. The mother and the artist arrive in a chauffeured auto and offer Charlie money for his services, money which he rejects. An impoverished violinist falls for a beautiful gypsy girl. Together they meet an artist who paints the girl's portrait. Charlie, the violinist, believes the girl loves the painter. Later, when a wealthy woman recognizes her long-ago- kidnapped daughter in the painting, she tracks down the girl with the artist's help. The gypsy girl is taken back to her rightful heritage, leaving Charlie thinking she has gone off with the artist he thinks she loves. But has she? Does she?
