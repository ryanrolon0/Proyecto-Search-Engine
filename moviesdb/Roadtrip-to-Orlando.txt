Roadtrip to Orlando

 In this seventh of the telling named "Spank This" series, four more scenes of merciless discipline on a total of five mischievous boys' behinds are meted out by four firm-handed educators during a road trip to Orlando, where the kids get tanned hotter then even sunny Florida's sun ever would.
