Sioux Me

 After being kicked out of the back of a moving truck, Woody and his pal Fink Fox encounter an Indian tribe. They are desperately wanting rain, and they believe they can get it by sacrificing a woodpecker. Fink Fox turns his back on Woody and agrees to catch him for a reward of gold from the Indians, but Woody proves a formidable opponent indeed.
