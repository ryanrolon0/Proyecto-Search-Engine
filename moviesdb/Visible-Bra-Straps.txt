Visible Bra Straps

 This is a story of two women, a young Italian corporate professional Sandra and a young Indian college student Sanjana. They would not have even known each other had their life continued as it is. Sandra has lost her job and Sanjana has lost her love. Their solitude brings them together, not in person but in virtual, through web chat. It seems that their pain is connecting them together, but it is not. They are entirely different as individuals and their cultures and way of lives are poles apart. It is their difference that is connecting them more and more. Visible Bra Straps is their point of reference to the freedom of Sandra and bounds of Sanjana.
