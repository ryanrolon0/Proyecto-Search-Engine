Tonny

 Tonny is 30 years old, works at a dead-end job and is stuck in a sad little suburb. He shares a run-down house with his shabby older brother, who always gets in trouble. Tonny is sick and tired of helping him out all the time. In fact, the only bright spot in Tonny's life is his girlfriend, Maria. But driving his brother back from the pub one night, Tony accidentally runs Maria's mother down. He panics and races off without being seen. Tonny is consumed with guilt and self loathing. How can he tell Maria, and can he ever make up for his misdeed?
