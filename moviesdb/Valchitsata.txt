 Anna is a young girl known by the nickname The She-wolf. Her defiant conduct conceals an unhappy childhood without parents, without true friends. Her open, sincere nature gets her involved in the sharp conflicts with the hypocrisy and indifference of those around her. Embittered and suspicious of everybody, she ends up in Borstal. Her appearance there disrupts the established regulations and gives rise to a rebellious spirit. The headmaster of the Borstal, however, is an experienced man of goodwill. He perceives the girls as victims of a bad milieu and gradually, wins their confidence. With great patience and chiefly with great trust the headmaster begins to transform Anna and to bring her back to people. In the endless dispute with the teachers he manages to defend the dignity of the girls and their faith in them. Thus, the warm human feelings of the headmaster help Anna overcome the confusion in her heart, her destructive hatred, and in the same time to regain her normal human self-confidence.
