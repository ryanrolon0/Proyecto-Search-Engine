Trees

 "Trees" serves as a comic warning about the devastating effects of deforestation of our rainforests. As the story unfolds, we move through a lush deep green pastoral jungle inhabited with exotic creatures. "Welcome to the oxygen factory! We breathe in the old CO2 and breathe out the O2. I tell you though, a lot more CO2 these days," barks a tall, skinny character who calls himself the "green collar guy." "Yeah, lotta CO2," confirms his leafy female companion. Suddenly, a chain saw starts up, followed by the sound of another tree crashing to the ground. "The rain! Tell them about the rain!" our fallen friend gasps. Green collar guy happily demonstrates what he calls "transpiration." We return to the two trees now on the edge of a stump-filled clear cut where they are the only lucky trees still standing. As we sadly depart, it seems clear not the only ones doomed in the end.
