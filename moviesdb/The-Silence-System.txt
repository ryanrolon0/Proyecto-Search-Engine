The Silence System

 The loyal, hardworking husband, who devotes every moment of his spare time to thoughts of his home, hastens from his place of business. On his homeward journey he buys a handsome ring for his wife. He resumes his journey homeward. Entering the house a few moments later than usual, he is met by his wife, and in exchange for his cheerful greetings receives harsh words. The wife ceases for a period, when he takes the morocco case from his pocket, opens it and displays the handsome ring he has purchased for her. She is immediately transformed from a veritable shrew into a loving, cheerful wife.
