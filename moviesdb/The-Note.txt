The Note

 When a plane crashes, Newspaper columnist Peyton MacGruder discovers a Note that was meant for the child of one of the passengers. "The Note" shows how dramatically life can change in a spilt second...the need to make a connection and reach out to someone you care about. If only we had a chance for those final goodbyes, to offer words of reconciliation, to say I love you or share regret. Who would you write to if you had only a few moments? What would you say?
