The Original Cast Album

 Welcome to Neverland! Seventeen year-old Gregory lives with his manic-depressive mom in a Manhattan apartment that looks more like the costume shop of some musty, old theater...long dark. Gregory owns just about every original cast album ever recorded, dresses up like Peter Pan and zealously clings to the notion that a better life awaits them at Rhode Island's Theater-By-The Sea where they can co-star in an endless summer of breezy musicals. Mother, however, professes to be an actress who doesn't sing, a situation Gregory tries to remedy by inviting a 500 lb. vocal coach to movie in with them. Add a wheelchair-dependent chorus girl and you have writer/director Edward Jordon's apocalyptic "Regards To Broadway"...a pitch black dramedy (with music) about four misfits desperately struggling to make their lives as rousing as the music on an "Original Cast Album."
