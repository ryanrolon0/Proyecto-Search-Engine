Transmission

 In 2057, Dr Sing records his final thoughts before sending a message back in time. It's destined for Mieke, who committed suicide last year. The message will appear to Mieke as a dream, where they can both engage their minds. Mieke was an artist tormented by self-doubt. For three months, Sing has studied video and photographs that are Mieke's only surviving mementos. The transmission will cost him his life. His final act is to try to convince Mieke that life is worth living. Sing is compelled to tell Mieke's story because she no longer can. We see Mieke's video and photographs throughout the film. At conclusion, it's revealed that Mieke herself has made the film, a portrait of Dr Sing, In Memoriam.
