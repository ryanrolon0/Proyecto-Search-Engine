The Ayudate Project

 A touching look into the lives of people who are learning new ways to help themselves at Circulo de Amigas, a tiny non-profit in Jinotega, Nicaragua. The film is about the cast and crew of local citizens who make a film showing the barrio how to battle the hunger and poverty left by decades of civil war.
