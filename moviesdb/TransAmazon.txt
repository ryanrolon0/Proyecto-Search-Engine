TransAmazon

 TransAmazon is a 41-minute documentary film about gender identity and the struggle for social change as seen through the eyes of one self-styled transgender warrior. This film explores evolving definitions of trans, genderqueer youth, the "bathroom bugaboo," radical challenges to the gender binary, "passing," violence and hate crimes, bigotry, and the possibility of uniting for cultural transformation. This is a gritty, grass-roots film which uses one individual's very personal struggle to raise fundamental questions about the construction of gender in contemporary society. As Joelle struggles to carve out a place for herself in the world, she urges viewers to see the common struggle of humanity and the interconnectedness of all life on the planet. Viewers watching the film will not only have their view of gender challenged, but their take on what it means to be one person fighting for change and freedom.
