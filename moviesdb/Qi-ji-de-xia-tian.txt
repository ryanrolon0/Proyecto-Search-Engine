 In Hualien, players of Mei Lun Junior High School football team are preparing for the upcoming National High School Games, one of the major youth football competitions in Taiwan. It is the last -- and the most important -- game in their three years of junior-high-school life. They are eager to win, not only because they are the defending champion, but also they want to devote the title to their beloved coach as his wedding gift.
