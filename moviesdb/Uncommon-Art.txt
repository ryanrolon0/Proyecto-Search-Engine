Uncommon Art

 Dale, a homeless artist in Boston, finds his way to Common Art, a program designed to give homeless artists the space and resources necessary to create their own art. Over time, he hones skills he learned as a child and develops new skills to create and sell his own art. He travels around Boston, selling his art, entertaining children with animal balloons and earning a small living, all while still trying to find shelter each night and beat the rush of people into the area homeless shelters. The creation and selling of art finally inspires him to apply for housing assistance, and having spent years on the street, he must maintain his self-confidence and hope while weathering the lengthy delays caused by bureaucracy and the many hundreds of others trying to escape homelessness. Our journey with him follows his bridge from homelessness to having an apartment. In order to maintain his housing, Dale must do community service. He fulfills this mission by giving back to the very group that gave him the self-confidence and means to pull himself out of poverty, by teaching in the Common Art program on making flowers and other pieces of art.
