The Ord

 We become the ghosts haunting an abandoned city the size of San Francisco. We discover 583 murals, painted by soldiers, forgotten in institutional architecture that rots in a sublime and familiar way. Shot in HD on a 5-D Mark ii, this experimental documentary features beautiful cinematography and elaborate soundscapes.
