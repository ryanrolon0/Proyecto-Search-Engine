Supari

 Aryan Pandit lives a middle-class lifestyle with his family in Nasik, India, where the entire family depend on his salesman dad's earnings. He re-locates to Bombay's St. Andrews College, has big dreams of being wealthy and driving a red Ferrari. He befriends 3 other middle-classed youth, Papad, Mushy, and Chicken. He borrows money from Matka Rajan, gambles it, loses everything, is unable to re-pay, and as a result Rajan sets his goons on him. He goes to a man named Baba for help, who in turn takes him to a Mamta Shekari, who offers to hire him as a hit man, agrees to pay him Twenty thousand Rupees for every killing, so that he can re-pay his gambling loan. Aryan reluctantly accepts, is trained by Baba to shoot a gun, and kills his first target, none other than Rajan himself. He tells his friends about his good fortune, and they too join forces with him. In all killing contracts they are provided with a photograph, the location, and are instructed to look at the photo just 15 minutes before killing the person. In this manner the friends' enjoy their new-found wealth. When Aryan's Parsi girlfriend, Dilnawaaz finds out, she wants him to quit, which he does, but his friends refuse to let go of this easy life and money. Shortly thereafter, the trio are given a contract, the location is Bhuleshwar, and shortly before the killing they look at the photograph - the photo is none other than that of Aryan. And the trio know that it is too late to back out of this particular Supari (Contract killing).
