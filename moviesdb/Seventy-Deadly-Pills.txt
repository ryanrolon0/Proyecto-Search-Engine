Seventy Deadly Pills

 A gang of children, "The Rockets" have their clubhouse (above an old garage) used by a pair of villains on the run. The villains have stolen a doctors car which had some deadly pills left in it. One of the children finds the pills and, thinking they are sweets, shares them out to the rest of the gang. The race is on for the police to find them all before the children eat any of the deadly pills.
