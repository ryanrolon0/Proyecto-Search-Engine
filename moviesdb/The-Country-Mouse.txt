The Country Mouse

 A strong mouse says that he will become the heavyweight champion of the world. But his grandma (who is just as strong) doesn't want him to fight. So that night he sneaks off to the fight, which Granny hears on the radio. Granny is so concerned she goes to the arena to stop him from fighting...but fate plays a hand.
