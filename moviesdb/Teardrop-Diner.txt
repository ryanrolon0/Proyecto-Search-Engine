Teardrop Diner

 A short that playfully asks, 'Why do fools fall in love?' It features lovers crying in a diner set to 50's doo-wop. It is comprised of a series of vignettes showing romantic disasters; greasers and squares alike experience the cycle of heartbreak. In the middle of it all is a waiter who is increasingly disturbed by the crying of the diner's patrons. The infectious melody of the music paired with the sobbing faces celebrates heartache with cynicism and glee.
