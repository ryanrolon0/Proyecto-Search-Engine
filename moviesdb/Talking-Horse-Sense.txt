Talking Horse Sense

 Oscar is a dreamer who's never met a get-rich-quick scheme he didn't like, no matter how disastrously it would turn out, much to the dismay of his wife, Ethel. Oscar thinks he's finally found his gold mine when he comes across a talking horse in front of a glue factory. Oscar buys the horse, who he names "Gabby." But it turns out Gabby can gab to only one person, and one person only Gabby until Oscar figures out another way the horse can make him wealthy.
