The Gospel of St. Jive

 The film is about a homeless man, Jerry, who knows that he is in a movie, he is aware that the audience is watching him and of the narrator which he interacts with. Because he is being watched he tries to do saintly deeds for the city so people will judge his character well. In particular he tries to help a homeless woman. However it becomes apparent through his interaction with her, that Jerry's 'awareness' could be construed as mental illness. Through the movie he has to choose which reality he wants to accept.
