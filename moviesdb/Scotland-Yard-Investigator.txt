Scotland Yard Investigator

 At the outbreak of World War II, the famous 'Mona Lisa' is removed from the Lourve Museum in Paris, and stored for safekeeping in London. Sir James Collison, director of National Art Museum in London, is determined to safeguard the priceless painting. But Carl Hoffmeyer, a German fanatic art collector, is equally determined to steal the painting even it takes murder to do so.
