The Weird World of Blowfly

 THE WEIRD WORLD OF BLOWFLY tells the story of singer/songwriter Clarence Reid and his alter ego Blowfly, the original dirty rapper. At 69 years-old, with a catalog of the world's raunchiest tunes, Blowfly continues to record new material and tour the world, struggling for success and recognition. The film highlights both Clarence's and Blowfly's unique contributions to music history, including Top-10 R&B hits and what might be the world's first rap song, recorded in 1965. On tour and at home, we see Clarence's life, career, and philosophy unfold. A revealing portrait of an unheralded man, THE WEIRD WORLD OF BLOWFLY examines Clarence's personal and professional contradictions, explores his legacy, and celebrates his musical and cultural significance as a rapper and soul music legend.
