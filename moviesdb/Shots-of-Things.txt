Shots of Things

 A young filmmaker who makes fun movies with his friends breaks his HD camera while filming with a dutch angle. The camera tips over and breaks. Without the camera, and with a film festival fast approaching, he decides to use an old DV camera to shoot an art film, believing that he will wow audiences with insight and art instead of flashy visuals and mindless entertainment. Throughout the filmmaking process he transforms from a fun filmmaker to a pretentious one, seeking awards glory for his 'vision', and losing his friends. As he nears the end of his filming, he uses a dutch angle once again, tipping over the camera and breaking it.
