Saturday Afternoon

 Harry and his friend have planned to go out for an afternoon of fun. But first, Harry must figure out how to slip away from his domineering wife with some money to spend. Once he finally does get away, he finds that his troubles are only beginning. Foundry worker Harry Higgins, the original Mr. Milquetoast but with an unscratched itch, yields to the request of his bachelor friend, Steve Smith, to accompany him on an afternoon of fun and frolic with Pearl and Ruby. Harry retrieves the few spare coins he has hidden under the carpet from the eyes of his bickering, domineering wife, and shuffles along for a rendezvous with the two flirtatious shop-girls. The shop girls also have two burly shop-guys as boyfriends.
