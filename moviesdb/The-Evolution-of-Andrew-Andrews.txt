The Evolution of Andrew Andrews

 30-year-old Andrew Andrews has never had a friend, unless a 3 foot rubber alien doll counts. Yet, in his quest to be a somebody, this clueless "man child" ruins a full length feature film in one morning. When his studio mogul father exiles him from his cushy womb, Andrew must fend for himself for the first time in his life. Is it too late for Andrew to learn how to make friends, make money and even make love? Or are some grown-ups children forever? This heartwarming, oddball comedy takes you through the pains of "growing up" one laugh at a time.
