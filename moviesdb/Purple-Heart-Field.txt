Purple Heart Field

 World Reknowned Field Portrait Artist (Roger Baker) is filmed, uncensored, wearing his emotions out there for us to see, as he sets out to honor the men and women who did what they had to do in war. He was moved by the bravery, by those who stood tall in a time of crisis and honored their fellow human beings, by putting themselves in harms way. He carved 'The Worlds Largest Portrait of The Purple Heart' (850,000 sq ft) in a giant field as a thank you from us to them.
