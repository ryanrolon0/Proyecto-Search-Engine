Swimming Lessons

 Eight year old Zoie hates to get wet. She hates swimming. And above all, she hates swimming lessons. And today is the worst Saturday in swimming lesson history - because today - is testing day. Zoie will have to squeeze herself into a cold, clammy piece of Lycra in a public changing room, risk life and toe crossing publicly trodden-on floors, brave "the showers", get her face wet in the shallow end - and perform the dreaded 'Dead Man's Float'. And, she'll have to do it in the deep end. Today is the day that Zoie must swim, or sink, in the deep end. And she's in way over her head.
