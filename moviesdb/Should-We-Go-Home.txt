Should We Go Home

 A group of amateur filmmakers are trying to make a film about a mature upper class woman who claims that she has lost her house. Wondering the lonely and cold streets of the city, she seems to be in a very particular mind of state, she is more interested and talking about the world than answering the question about why did she loose her home?. This feeling of lost is impregnated in the whole film and it will become the main topic of it, this will cause even the lost of the film itself.
