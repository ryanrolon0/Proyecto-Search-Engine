Quan plovien bombes

 Quan plovien bombes (Raining Bombs) commemorates the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the bombings in Barcelona, during the Spanish Civil War. The interest of the project is not only the presence of the survivors, but mainly the way in which their memory is transmitted to other generations, usually very unaware of the Spanish Civil War reality.
