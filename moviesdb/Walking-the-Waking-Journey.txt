Walking the Waking Journey

 Set against the backdrop of a country rich with history and cultural identity, the journey is a glimpse into the hopes and dreams of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Seven years ago, Lama Tenzin, a young Tibetan monk, rescued children from poor living conditions in the isolated villages in the Himalayan border region of Upper Dolpo, Nepal. He built a home for them in India where he raised and educated them, and provided them with spiritual guidance with the hope that these children would return to their homes one day and do the same for their communities. In 2008, Lama Tenzin took the eleven children he rescued on a 30 day journey back to visit their homes and families. Walking the Waking Journey is the documentation of that remarkable voyage. The viewer is invited to join Lama Tenzin and the children as they move through the fierce and jagged beauty of the Himalayan landscape.
