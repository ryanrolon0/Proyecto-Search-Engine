The Krolevsky Case

 Inspired by the drama 'Biography' by M. Frisch university teacher in the middle of a conjugal crisis. He suddenly has the exceptional possibility of modifying the course of his life by revisiting his past through theatrical rehearsals. As the scenes develop, chess-pieces compose and decompose the game-like course of his life. An area without dimensions, lost in an ethereal whiteness, in which there are only, as suspended in the void, six geometric form-objects of different colors and a staircase. Sitting on a cylinder, a man faces a chessboard placed on a cube. His name is Kurmann, and he has just been asked to play again the match of his life; he's a fifty year-old man suffering from a long-term crisis.Under the watchful direction of a mysterious childish voice, heard off a vinyl disc in continuous rotation on a turntable placed on the top of a pyramid, Kurmann is able to ask indefinitely at his will to restore the game to an earlier stage, and hence tries to modify a certain event in order to change the course of the subsequent ones.
