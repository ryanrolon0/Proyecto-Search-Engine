Press 1 for English

 This is a film the US government does not want you to see. Press 1 For English exposes Washington's immigration policies and its handling of the devastating effects of crime, murder, trafficking, narco-terrorism, smuggling, and border violence that have turned the communities of the southwest into the wild west again. For years you have wanted to see a documentary that takes an honest, forthright look at US immigration without interpretation, and now... you finally have it.
