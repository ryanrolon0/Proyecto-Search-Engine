The X-Rated Grandma

 Filmmaker Jack Truman returns back home to the Bible Belt, and over a 3 year period, filmed a collection of 7 shorts about his real-life Mother, Opal, a former stripper. Some documentary, some mockumentary, the audience is left to decide....which is real? Which is not? You be the judge. Nothing is as it seems.
