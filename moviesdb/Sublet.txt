Sublet

 A guy traumatized by his 80s childhood must deal with a streak of bad luck after his lease runs out sooner than expected. It doesn't help matters much that he is forced to play in an '80s revival band' and share an apartment with the obnoxious lead singer. Featured in the 2006 Tisch School of the Arts First Run Film Festival/2006 SXSW Film Festival
