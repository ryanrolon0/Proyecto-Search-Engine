Prehistoric Perils

 Mighty Mouse encounters a Time Machine while trying to save pure-hearted Pearl Pureheart from the unwanted advances and clutches of the evil oily-villain, Oil Can Harry. After brief stops in 1620 and 1890, and ancient Egypt, Mighty Mouse finds himself in the prehistoric age of the dinosaurs. He mops up on Harry and the dinosaurs, proving he can take care of anyone, anyplace, anywhere at any time.
