Prince of Jerusalem

 Abd al-Qader al-Husseini tells the story of four sites in Jerusalem connected to the history of the al-Husseini family- one of the most prominent families in Palestinian society. Abd al-Qader speaks about his father, Faisal al-Husseini, a Palestinian leader who worked for Palestinian self-determination and especially for a free and open Jerusalem, and about his grandfather and namesake, Abd al-Qader al-Husseini, who was the commander of the Palestinian resistance in 1948 and was killed during the battle at Qastal. 'The two people have rights upon this land. History forces war on us. Reality requires co-existence in peace.' (Faisal al-Husseini, 'Haaretz', 1968)
