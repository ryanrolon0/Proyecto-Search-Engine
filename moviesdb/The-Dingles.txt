The Dingles

 The Dingles are Doris and her three cats. Life is idyllic, until the day a big windstorm threatens to blow the cats away, but Doris ties the cats to her apron and manages to get inside. Once inside, they have warm milk and honey. The cats climb into Doris' bed and spend the night, snug and safe.
