The Sneakers

 Emily lives in South Boston with her daughter, Fara. Struggling to make ends meet on her waitress wages, she tries to protect her daughter from the harsh realities of their economic situation. But when Emily cannot afford shoes for her family she must choose between her own needs and her daughters sense of belonging. The Sneakers is a work of social-realism that focuses on the issues so many working families face today.
