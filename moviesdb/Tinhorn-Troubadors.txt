Tinhorn Troubadors

 Straying none too far from the premise of two earlier Edgar Kennedy shorts - Locks and Bonds (1937), and Wall Street Blues (1946), where the wife uses stock certificates as wallpaper - this Wally Brown-Jack Kirkwood short finds them as unemployed song-and-dance men who give their landlady 50 shares of what they think is worthless stock to pay their room rent. They hear the stock is worth $6000 and, after some inept second-story work, recover the certificates, only to discover the stock really is worthless.
