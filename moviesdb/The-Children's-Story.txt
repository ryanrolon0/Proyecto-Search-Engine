The Children's Story

 A just-established totalitarian government places a new teacher in a classroom of young children while the old teacher is sent away. The new teacher challenges the students' view of their world. Young Johnny asks questions, but the teacher manages to twist the truth into reasonable answers. It doesn't take long for the children to see things the new teacher's way.
