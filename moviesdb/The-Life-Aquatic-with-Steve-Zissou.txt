The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

 When his partner is killed by the mysterious and possibly nonexistent Jaguar Shark, Steve Zissou and his Team Zissou crew set off for an expedition to hunt down the creature. Along with his estranged wife, a beautiful journalist and a co-pilot who could possibly be Zissou's son, the crew set off for one wild expedition. Steve Zissou, sea-film auteur a la Jacques Cousteau, has reason to be melancholy his wife may be taking up with her ex-husband, a young man appears claiming Steve is his father (Steve hates fathers), his most recent films have tanked, he's having trouble raising money for his venture to revenge his partner, and he's attracted to a pregnant reporter who prefers the pretender. At sea, in pursuit of the shark, will he escape pirates and mutiny, forge the bonds of fatherhood, place his arm around his wife, find the monster of the deep, re-establish box office hegemony, and discover a reason to smile? While making a documentary, the famous oceanographer Steve Zissou loses his dear friend, eaten by a jaguar shark. He raises funds for an expedition in his ship Belafonte to hunt the shark and make a new film. The journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson and a pilot that claims to be his unknown son, Ned Plimpton, join his crew in their journey, planned by his wife Eleanor Zissou. While making the movie, they are attacked by pirates and left without any money to finish their work.
