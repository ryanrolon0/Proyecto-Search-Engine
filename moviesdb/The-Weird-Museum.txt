The Weird Museum

 For nearly half a century, "THE WEIRD MUSEUM", was known as the world's only, walk-in-off-the-street sideshow. In late 1999, after 50 years of existing in relative obscurity, the Los Angeles Police Department raided the museum and carted away it's entire contents. What they hauled away consisted of skeletons, skulls and shrunken heads, as well as, birth oddities in jars, diseased organs, dismembered hands, the heads of mass murderers, Bluebeard and Hamander The Warlock, a 3,000 year old mummy and the actual earthly remains of 15th Century tyrant, Vlad (The Impaler) Tepes. This documentary was shot only weeks before the place was emptied out by the city of Los Angeles. It is known to be the very last tour, not to mention, the only known existing footage of "THE WEIRD MUSEUM".
