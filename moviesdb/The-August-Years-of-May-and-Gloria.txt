The August Years of May and Gloria

 The August Years of may and Gloria is a darkly humorous, compassionate and intimate documentary about an aging Scottish mother who lives with her adult daughter. 'We're like a married couple, except that we're mother and daughter', begins the daughter, Gloria. With May in the early stages of Alzheimer's, the pair navigates through life as if they are on an extended vacation, not quite knowing where they are headed. But as each day becomes more of a struggle, Gloria decides to uproot them and take her mother back to Scotland.
