The Astounding She-Monster

 A pair of crooks (Kenne Duncan and Jeanne Tatum) take over the country house of a geologist (Robert Clarke) and his trusty dog. They have kidnapped an heiress (Marilyn Harvey) where they plan to hold her until the ransom is collected. Soon they hear an explosion in the woods nearby that turns out to be a spaceship containing a sexy blonde alien with a skintight metallic suit, high heels, lipstick, and incredible eyebrows (Shirley Kilpatrick). Don't let her touch you in any way! The plot is advanced by an off-screen narrator.
