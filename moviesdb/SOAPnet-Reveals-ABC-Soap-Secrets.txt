SOAPnet Reveals ABC Soap Secrets

 Preempting The View for one day in August, this TV Special aired as a way to entice Soap Viewers to stick to their shows during the 2004 summer olympics. Main actors from ABC's "All My Children", "General Hospital" & "One Life to Live" discuss upcoming storylines on their shows with Ty Tredway and Lisa Rinna ( the hosts of the Emmy nominated soap discussion program SoapTalk ).
