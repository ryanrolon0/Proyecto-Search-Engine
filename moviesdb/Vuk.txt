Vuk

 Vuk returns from Sweden to find his best friend Zeka addicted to heroin and his one time flame Dunja, a desperate young woman, so far from the cheery girl she used to be. Vuk tries to help Zeka. First off he tries to scare away the dealers who purue Zeka over some allegedly stolen dope. Vuk's threat initially works but then dealers reply with unmatched brutality. Their response spins Vuk into the underbelly of Belgrade's underground that features coldblooded murderers, extortions, charitable cab drivers and illegal surgeons.
