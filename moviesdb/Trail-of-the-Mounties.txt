Trail of the Mounties

 Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman Sandy Sanderson (Russell Hayden) is given the task of rounding up a gang of fur thieves led by his twin brother Johnny (Russell Hayden). The brother, by masquerading as Sandy in a Mountie uniform, puts suspicion of fur stealing and murder on Sandy. Sandy narrowly escapes a lynching before escaping and bringing his brother and the rest of the gang to justice.
