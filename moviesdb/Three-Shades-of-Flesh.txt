Three Shades of Flesh

 Three frolicsome roommates, tired of the way men have been "using them," decide to take matters into their own hands (and other parts of their bodies). Diane has grown tired of being passed from hand to mouth or from one man to another. She makes an agreement with Lynn and Alice, both willing to learn from her and Alice. For the next 75 minutes you are lost in a kaleidoscope of human colors.
