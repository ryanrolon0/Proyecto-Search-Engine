Teddy

 From creators Steve Goltz and Kevin Sommerfield comes a new experiment in terror. A throwback to the slasher films of the 1980's, "Teddy be a Bear" tells the story of four college students that get more than the bargained for when a hit-and-run accident turns into murder. Revenge is a dish best served hot with a hatchet in one hand and a teddy bear in the other. Will they "bearly" be able to survive the night?
