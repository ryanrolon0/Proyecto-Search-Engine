Red River Shore

 When an oil discovery is reported at Paxton, Oklahoma, Marshal Rex Allen immediately suspects that where there is oil, there is trouble. Rex arrives just as a band of desperadoes stage a bank hold-up and escape with $25,000 which ranchers have invested in prospective oil drillings. Rex discovers that rancher Frank Barlowe is behind the bogus oil venture which is fleecing the local ranchers. Marlowe is killed in the hectic proceedings and his son, Ned Marlowe, unwittingly carries on the oil deal. Marlowe's secret partner in the hoax, Case Lockwood, convinces Ned that Rex killed his father. Oil is actually discovered on the property and Lockwood, with his attempted land-grab scheme, is tripped up by Rex. The respected oilman Barlow has a deal with Lockwood to rob him of the money he has collected for a new well. When Rex has to shoot him, he asks Rex not to tell his son he was an outlaw. When the son Frank brings in the well, Lockwood tells him Rex shot his father. Now both the outlaws and Frank are after Rex.
