Wasps

 A wasp exterminator travels to a large stately home to deal with a wasp infestation problem. However when he arrives he is greeted by a dysfunctional, hate filled family that attacks each other with spite and hurtful remarks. He reassesses his feelings towards the wasps that only sting in self defence.
