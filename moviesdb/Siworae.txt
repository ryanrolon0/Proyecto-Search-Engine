 Moving into "Il Mare", his new apartment building, Sung-hyun finds a delivery in his mailbox, a love letter sent by a woman called Eun-ju to the man who has left her. They begin a correspondence and arrange to meet. Eun-joo moves out of her house "Il Mare", leaving behind a Christmas card for the eventual new owner of the house in 1999. In it she asks him/her to forward any mail of hers to her new address in the city. It is 1997 and Sung-hyun, the first owner of "Il Mare" is moving in and finds in his mailbox the Christmas card from Eun-joo. Thinking it was a joke, Sung-hyun leaves her a letter telling her so and reminds her that its 1997 not 1999. Eventually the two realize that they are separated by two years of time but can somehow communicate through the mailbox and begin to form a friendship through their letters In the year 1999, a young woman leaves her quaint house on the sea and returns to the city, leaving behind in the mailbox a card for the next owner, with instructions to forward any mail of hers to the new address. In the year 1997, a young jaded architect moves into the same house...and finds the letter. His reply, which he slips into the mailbox, finds its way to her, beginning a parallel-time love story separated by a span of two years.
