Snitch in New York

 New York's Toughest Police Precinct has six escaped felons on the loose. These dangerous criminals specialize in insurance schemes, drug-running, paid assassinations,pimping, and organized robberies. Feeling pressure from New York's top brass, the precinct elite set out to arrest these hard to get criminals by using their number one weapon... A snitch.
