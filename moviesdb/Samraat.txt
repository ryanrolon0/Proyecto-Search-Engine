Samraat

 Captain Chawla has been employed for years with a cargo shipping company run by Ranbir. While celebrating the new year, Chawla hears gunshots and goes below to investigate. He finds out that one of his officers, Gomes, has shot and killed a drunken sailor. Before he could do anything to address this situation, there is an explosion abroad the ship, "Samraat", which subsequently sinks. Ranbir finds out that Chawla was misusing his captaincy and smuggling gold bars, and files a police complaint, Chawla is arrested and imprisoned. His daughter, Suman, returns from England and decides to find out what really happened as her dad claims that he is innocent. In order to carry out this investigation, she hires two crazy divers, Ram and Raju alias Raj, who decide to undertake this mission. Then Ram finds out that the ship contains gold bars which are virtually their's for the taking. He informs Raj, only to find out that Raj is only interested in handing over the gold to the Government, as he has fallen in love with Suman, and wants to assist her in proving her dad's innocence. The question remains will both friends be able to reconcile their differences, and is Chawla really telling the truth?
