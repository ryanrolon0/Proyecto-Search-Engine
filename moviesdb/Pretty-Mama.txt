Pretty Mama

 Karin Dittmann is married and mother of two children. Without her it would work nothing. She helps her husband in the office and takes care of her both sons. But her hard efforts aren't appreciated. When she finally wins a Caribbean-journey at a competition, actually she takes part despite the astonishment of her family, while her husband keep home with the kids. During the vacations she gets to know an admirer.
