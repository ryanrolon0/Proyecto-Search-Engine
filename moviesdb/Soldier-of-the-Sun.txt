Soldier of the Sun

 Arthur Silver has a unique weekly ritual which is magnificently captured by filmmaker Scott Wells. Wells is able to dive deep into the magnificently mind of Silver as he performs his ritual which includes staring into the sun for 20 minutes, blowing a rams horn, and wearing tefillin tight around both arms. It truly is a sight to be seen.
