Swim

 To raise funds and awareness for disabled veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Air Force veteran David Broyles and Army officer Rush Vann attempt to become only the 16th and 17th Americans to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar, from Spain to Africa. Fewer Americans have accomplished their challenge than have climbed Mount Everest.
