TS

 Social worker Hugo works with teenagers in an underserved community in Montreal, Quebec. On a daily basis, he deals and reads through their silence, fears, distress and rage. When he nearly loses one of his proteges, he has to fight against a world that attempts to solve every problem with rapid and drastic solutions. In the end, staying true to the humanity inside each one of us seems to be our best chance for hope. This film is a cry from the heart and launches a debate about possible solutions to help Canadian youth. TS Social Worker is also a tribute to those who work everyday to try to find human solutions to this problem workers ('TS' in French).
