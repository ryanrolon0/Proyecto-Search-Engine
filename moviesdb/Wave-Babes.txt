Wave Babes

 Three fortyish women, Sam, Val and Maureen, friends since high school, meet up at their old teenage, beach hangout to celebrate Val's divorce. While there, they come face to face with people from their past, (ex-husband, trophy wife, old surf rivals...) forcing Val to re-examine her life, give up the ghosts of her past and start living in the present.
