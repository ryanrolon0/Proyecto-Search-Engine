Tayeb, Khalas, Yalla

 In 'Tripoli', Lebanon, where family ties run deep, a forty year old man still living with his elderly mother has given up on the idea of becoming independent, but when suddenly his mother leaves him, he is left with nothing but the company of a city and what it offers. It's a coming of age story of an adult man finding his comfort for the first time, alone, in the city he grew up in.
