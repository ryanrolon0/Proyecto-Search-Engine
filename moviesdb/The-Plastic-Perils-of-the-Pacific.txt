The Plastic Perils of the Pacific

 The Plastic Perils of the Pacific tackles the dangers posed by plastic garbage in the open sea with humor. Our hero, a neurotic little red crab, finds his paradise under assault by the intrusion of a water bottle. He undertakes a fantastic journey through the beautiful realm of a coral reef meeting and helping other sea-life along the way.
