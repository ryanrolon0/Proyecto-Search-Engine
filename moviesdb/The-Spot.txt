The Spot

 November 22, 1963. A day that America and the world will never forget. Four decades later, as the rest of Dallas makes strides as a 21st century city, the spot where President Kennedy was shockingly assassinated remains eerily and forever frozen in time. A reflection on the melancholy and exploitation of a place forever branded in the American psyche, this impressionistic and voyeuristic film exposes the bizarre happenings taking place every day around Dealey Plaza--a prosaic site, made significant by the event that has come to define it.
