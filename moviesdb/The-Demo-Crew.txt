The Demo Crew

 In order to make his legal problems disappear, ANTHONY VALENTINE agrees to form an amateur men's street hockey team and represent his home town in a state-wide tournament. Although he sees this as an opportunity to keep the old gang together, the old gang does not, and very reluctantly plays along half heartedly, until one of their teammates is killed in an auto accident. Suddenly the young men feel a sense of loyalty, bond together to become better friends than they ever were, and make a pact to play this tournament in honor of their deceased buddy. With the hometown behind them and a fallen brother watching down, the team strives for the title, not knowing that, win or lose, they've already become champions. Anthony Valentine tries to keep his childhood pals together in their latter years by drafting them onto a recreational street hockey team to compete as they had as kids. They reluctantly agree to play and do so halfheartedly until one of them is killed in a car accident. The players now bond together and become better friends than they'd ever been as they strive to become champions, dedicating the effort to their fallen brother.
