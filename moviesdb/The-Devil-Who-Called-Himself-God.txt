The Devil Who Called Himself God

 Rebecca comes from a good home, but still sees little sense in life. She feels left out from her father's new family, she's had an abortion, she's tried to commit suicide, and she hates life in the city. In this condition, she meets Lukas, a gentle, but at the same time, strong-willed and good-looking young man. Lukas and his friends live in a commune out in the woods. They share their drugs and bodies, and beg or steal whatever they have to in order to get by. Rebecca falls in love with Lukas and soon feels more comfortable in the commune than she does at home. Together, they develop a criminal energy that knows no boundaries and leads them to cold-blooded murder...
