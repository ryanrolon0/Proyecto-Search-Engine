Tredici

 On September 10th 2000 in Soverato, a seaside town in Calabria, a huge mass of water hit a camping that hosted a group of disabled people on holiday. The tsunami-like wave caught them during their sleep, causing thirteen victims. The short film reenacts those tragic events, alternating archive footage with testimonies of survivors and people who risked their lives in the rescue operations.
