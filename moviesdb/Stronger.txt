Stronger

 Following David Patterson, a bodybuilder and personal trainer, this film explores what it's like to commit to a fitness based lifestyle and be competitive in the sport of bodybuilding. The documentary includes a behind the scenes look at the Washington Ironman bodybuilding competition; a natural, drug tested event. Shot in two days, the film takes a raw, un-embellished look at the reality of a life's pursuit of a singular goal - stronger.
