Song of David

 David Fisher is a sixteen year old soul-searching Hasidic who is studying to become a rabbi in a Los Angeles Yeshiva. Alienated by the social boundaries that enclose him, he reaches out to the broader world. He becomes obsessed with rap music, wherein he discovers artistic freedom and honest self expression. He then must choose between diverging worlds.
