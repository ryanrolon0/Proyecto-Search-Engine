Sneaky Snake

 Sneaky Snake (a green sock puppet), whose escapades often get him into hot water. In this episode, Sneaky becomes lost in the Holy City of Jerusalem, searching for a McDonald's bacon-cheeseburger. Along the way he meets a Rabbi, a Priest, and a Mullah, who each recommend a 'particular' surgical procedure on Sneaky's anatomy. In an amazing tour-de-force of acting, Sneaky plays all the roles in this culturally diverse short.
