The Home Economics Story

 This high-school educational film describes the benefits and opportunities available to young women who go to college and major in home economics. The film follows Kay, Helen, Louise, and Jean throughout their college years, as they take a variety of interesting and useful classes and eventually accept job offers in their chosen specialties. Nevertheless, the traditional middle-class ideals of marriage and stay-at-home motherhood are reinforced.
