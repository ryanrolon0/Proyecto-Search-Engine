Resurrection Man

 "Resurrection Man" is a journey through both unspeakable horror and a life-affirming lesson of love, hope and renewal. Grandison Harris, the "Resurrection Man," is he hero or hypocrite, villain or victim, rogue or redeemer? Six years of painstaking research-at every turn a revelation, a wonderment, a new horror-finally reveals the untold true story of how one man's actions would at once savagely betray a people and, ultimately, impact the course of education, science, art, culture...life as we know it, forever.
