Really Hard Be Good Masai

 This moving portrait grants an intriguing insight into the live of adolescent Masai-warriors. In its entire complexity and variety the daily routine as well as the cycle of its accompanying show for the tourists are demonstrated with the stylistic means of Direct Cinema - for which the script of director Gabriele Neudecker has been awarded. 'Really hard be good Masai' is a chronicle of young Morani-warriors and a small panorama of role-aspects between being guardian of tradition, modern teenager or tourist attraction.
