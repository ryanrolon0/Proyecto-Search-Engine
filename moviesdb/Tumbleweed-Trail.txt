Tumbleweed Trail

 Barton has his men knock off Bill Ryan so that Barton will end up with his ranch. He has a forged will that gives the ranch and everything on it to him, and not Bill's kid's. But Eddie and Soapy show up to help Robin retain the ranch for as long as she can. But Barton's lawyer, Small, seems to have all the cards and wants Robin out so that Barton can pay off his debts. Eddie Dean's assignment is to thwart the efforts of a crooked gambler, Brad Barton, to take over the property of his half-brother Bill Ryan. In order to secure the ranch, which is believed to hold large silver deposits, the scheming relative contracts to have Ryan killed. He then presents a forged will to the court naming himself as the sole heir. Shocked by the tide of events, Ryan's two rightful heirs, his grown daughter Robin and young son "Freckles" are determined to remain on their father's property. Eddie and his sidekick, Soapy Jones, arrive on the scene in time to enter the fight on the side of Robin and "Freckles."
