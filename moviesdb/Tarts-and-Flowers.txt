Tarts and Flowers

 A fey chef delivers his daily recipes over the airwaves and into ladies' kitchens, including the kitchen of a young lady named Little Audrey. The radio announcer's frantic instructions for baking gingerbread wipe out Little Audrey, who goes to rest on a stool. Moments later, her timer goes off. And what should happen next but the gingerbread boy she is baking busts out of the oven, demanding to know why he is in her kitchen and not Cakeland where he belongs. The boy runs away and Audrey takes chase. He upsets a can of flour and suddenly Audrey's way is obscured by white clouds. Audrey gasps when she realizes that now she is indeed up in the clouds. And that's where she finds Cakeland, whose every citizen is a delicious pastry. Once she catches up with the gingerbread boy, she finds him with the angel food cake he plans to marry. Audrey helps the bride get ready for the wedding, which proves to be a grand event. But once the bride and groom are at the altar, a devil's food cake suddenly appears and kidnaps the poor bride. Audrey, armed with an egg beater, goes to the rescue.
