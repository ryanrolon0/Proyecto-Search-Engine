Social Work

 Every weekend the streets surge with crowds looking for love, music and oblivion. "Social Work" is about the people who provide it to them - those faceless heroes whose Monday morning is other people's Friday night. It's a dirty job but someone's got to do it. The film takes place over one Saturday night shift in a seedy nightclub and centres on Lee and Andy, who work in the cloakroom. The club is the kind that people go to in every city and town all over the country.
