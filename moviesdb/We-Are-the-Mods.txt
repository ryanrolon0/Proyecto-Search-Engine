We Are the Mods

 Senior year was set to be uneventful for outsider, SADIE, a loner who observes the world through her 35mm camera. But when she befriends Nico, the pretty, new Mod girl with a deformed foot, everything changes. With Nico, Sadie explores the Mod subculture of 60's films, music, fashion, drugs, sex and scooters in her present day Southern California town. Nico's bi-sexual tendencies and junior college boyfriend, Treg, help Sadie find out who and what she really wants.
