The Eyes of the Amaryllis

 In 1880, a little girl is sent to Nantucket Island to live with her grandmother. She discovers, however, that her grandmother is an odd woman who has some strange habits, one of which is keeping a vigil for a lover of many years ago who went out to sea one day and never returned.
