The Travelers

 The Travelers is the story of the enduring love of Anna Rostov for her half-mad god-ridden husband Vanya. Exiled from Russia for religious fanaticism, for 20 years Vanya has dragged his brood of talented children from one small church to another all over America; exploiting their considerable talent, parceling them out to the congregation for bed and breakfast. Dying of leukemia, Vanya bravely persist in his calling. Every night after the service Vanya stays in the bus squinting under his kerosene lantern to translate the gospels from Greek into his native Russian. He is obsessed with taking his own version of Christ's teachings to his "god starved" Russian countrymen. As the children mature, they increasingly reject their father's dictatorial way and eventual break his heart by selling out their talents to the Christian right. Anna's steadfast love for her insensitive husband and rebellious children hold the fragile fabric of their lives together as their traveling days come to an end. The journey's end is just the beginning.
