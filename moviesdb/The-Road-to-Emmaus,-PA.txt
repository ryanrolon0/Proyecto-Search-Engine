The Road to Emmaus, PA

 Three somewhat skeptical friends take a road trip in a haggard RV reenacting an ancient Biblical pilgrimage. In the gospel of Luke, the resurrected Jesus is said to appear to two travelers walking form Jerusalem to Emmaus in ancient Israel. This is the modern story of three travelers looking for Jesus between Jerusalem, Ohio and Emmaus, PA. What starts as an investigative experiment ends as a poignant story of post-modern pilgrimage and communal awakening.
