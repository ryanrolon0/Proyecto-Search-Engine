Waterfront Access?

 Waterfront Access? is an experimental film that connects a group of people from the City to the Brooklyn shore. As the dance evolves through various landscapes, life and colors arise, unveiling a message at each location Just - One - Person - Can - Create - Peace - And - Change - The - World. There are very few areas left in New York City where the general public has access to the waterfront; we would like this to change.
