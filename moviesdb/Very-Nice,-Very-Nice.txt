Very Nice, Very Nice

 The current day-to-day life is much different than what it was thirty or forty years ago, but it is the life to which we as people are now accustomed and take for granted. But it also provides us with what we must deal, including joys, happiness, sorry and anxiety. These thoughts are interpreted through a series of snapshots and sounds - some, what we now take for granted as being givens, but some more disturbing - combined in such a way to make one ponder if life is indeed better than it was thirty years ago.
