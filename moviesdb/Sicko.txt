Sicko

 The filmmakers utilize a unique and interactive technique that blends two worlds together, creating a blur between what is real and what is not real. The story starts out with two deadbeat men whose luck have come to an end, but then a major twist in the plot, takes the story to a whole new dimension. At the end, the audience then realizes the title; 'Sicko' was really a pun, a play of words.
