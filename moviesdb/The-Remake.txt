The Remake

 A movie crew travels up north for a weekend of bonding before their next big movie shoot, a remake of the horror classic "Slaughter Camp 13!". Not everybody is happy with this project, ruining the integrity of the original slasher flick, especially a deranged fan who has entered their ranks to make sure This Remake NEVER HAPPENS!
