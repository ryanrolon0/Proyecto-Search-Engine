Torendion

 Auron and Gideon are just two average villagers until they stumble across Adira, a Highborn Lady who helps them to realize that they're more than meets the eye. Yet, in this epic fantasy adventure, it's not just the heroes who may be more than they seem. Will they make it through the night in a tavern laden with hidden dangers? The answers, to the prophecies, lie in Torendion.
