Rockboy

 ROCKBOY is the story of enduring friendship between two college buddies. Taylor Barnes is a recovering alcoholic on a sojourn to spiritual enlightenment and peace. Chadd Nessbaum is fresh from a broken heart. Together, they move to Seattle in hopes of finding better lives. Along the way, they meet a rockboy who helps them see the value in facing problems headlong rather than burying them in escapist addictions.
