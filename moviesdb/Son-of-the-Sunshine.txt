Son of the Sunshine

 Immersed in the dingy world of low-income housing and diagnosed at age 11 with Coprolalia Tourette's Syndrome, Sonny Johnns cries out to a world that has left him by the wayside. Using money saved from years of government disability he takes part in an experimental surgery promising to rid him of his violent outbursts. With his symptoms eradicated Sonny feels he is finally experiencing life for the first time. But as his disorder begins to vanish so too does a divine ability of which only he and his sister Meryl are aware; an ability that saved his sister's life and upon which Sonny may need to call again.
