Vuelve a mi

 Life moves forwards but what happens when it goes somewhere leaving just a person behind? 'Vuelve a Mi' is the story of a family's struggle to find normality in abnormal times. A tragedy befalls them after an untimely death, leaving the mother unable to recognise her daughter in a way that affects all those around and while life goes on no-one is happy. As they try to return to old times they are faced with either going all the way back into their old lives or making peace with the present.
