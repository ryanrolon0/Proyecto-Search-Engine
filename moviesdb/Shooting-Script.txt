Shooting Script

 On the evening of Friday, September 16th, 2005, film director and then NYU Graduate Film student, Frank Hall Green, was shot (with a gun, not a camera) in the stomach in an unexplained shooting. In 2007, he set out to make a film about his experience. Distraught over the very recent breakup with his 3 year girlfriend at the time of the shooting, he struggled with the personal exploration into the incident and the resulting film. 3 years later, he emerged with this documentary, Shooting Script, a personal journey of a filmmaker steeped in crime, humor, anxiety and love.
