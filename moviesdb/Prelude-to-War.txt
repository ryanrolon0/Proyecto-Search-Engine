Prelude to War

 This famous propaganda piece, used as a U.S. Army training film in WWII before theatrical release, asks 'why we fight.' The answer compares the 'free' and 'slave' worlds. Included Germany and Japan, while anti-militarism and isolationism rise in the USA; a look at enemy propaganda; and the first acts of aggression. Walter Huston narrates a combination of archival footage, maps, and other graphics. In this first installment of the "Why We Fight" US propaganda film series, the series illustrates a definiton of two worlds. The first is the Free world of the Allies' nations that honours life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The second is the Slave world of the Axis nations that honours only tyranny, brutality and unquestioning obedience to the leader and threatens to envelope the entire planet if the Free world does not make a stand.
