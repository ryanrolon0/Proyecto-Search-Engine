Solo

 Filmed over three years, following Joseph P. Gerges, a son of Egyptian immigrant parents and a young burgeoning 29 year-old artist on the verge of success after years of struggling to break into the Contemporary Fine Art World. With several major groups shows along with local and national publicity under his belt, the efforts of the artist have all led him to this singular point in his career; a rare opportunity to showcase over 25 works of art at the highly recognized Gallery C in Los Angeles, California. Joseph, acting simultaneously as director and artist, subjects himself, family members, and the gallery players to the unflinching gaze of the camera. The result is a candid, raw and unfiltered glimpse into the personal life of an artist struggling to keep financially afloat, to push the boundaries of his talent, and to ultimately make a living through the passions that have tenaciously driven him to this singular moment in his career- his first major Solo show. With the economic slowdown unknowingly looming, Joseph's relationships and talents are tested through the probing tensions of his financial and artistic struggles. When the economy begins to slide and his personal and artistic responsibilities collide, the heavy burden that is the life of a visual artist begins to take its toll.
