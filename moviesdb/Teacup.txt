Teacup

 Sela chain-smokes. She wears headphones all the time. They protect her from the outside world. She carries a knife. She walks the streets like a ghost-watching. Thinking. Everyone she passes appears just as isolated, she wonders if they even know. She has a secret... Making the best of the world, she contemplates the universe and observes the beauty around her, even in the filth. The more dangerous the area, the more she's drawn to it. And she walks... Some of the answers will never come, but she still contemplates. And when the time is right, she flies.
