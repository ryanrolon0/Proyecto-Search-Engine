Urban Mythology

 A cornucopia of unusual characters are sprinkled throughout this Middle-American community in which the characters are constantly encountering the stuff of urban legends and myths. This dark comedy examines the stereotypes in society through misconceptions and misunderstandings as the stories begin to ravel into each other, eventually explaining each other. A series of seemingly unrelated stories slowly mesh into one in this dark comedy about upper middle class suburbia, until slowly all of the stories begin to explain each other. The characters we meet, Carol Simpson, Dr. Jackson, Helen Mccall, and even darius the Flaming Shoe Clerk, are constantly encountering the stuff of urban legends. But whereas some stories might use urban legends as a cliche, or an in-joke, these characters never quite seem to catch on. Much of the humor, then, comes when the audience can second guess what will happen to the characters on the screen, sometimes laughing and sometimes cringing. But true to the form of the urban legend, just about the time the audience thinks they have it figured out, Urban Mythology pulls the rug out from under them, and they realize they didn't see quite what they thought they did. In some ways URBAN MYTHOLOGY is like a cinematic Rube Goldberg, with the entire puzzle only working when the pieces of each story fall into place.
