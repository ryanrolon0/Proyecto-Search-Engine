Thirty Proof Coil

 From the wilds of the Idaho indie scene (which you just now heard of) comes Thirty Proof Coil, a high-tension, psychological horror/suspense feature length piece starring Calico Cooper (daughter of rock legend Alice Cooper). A young woman is kidnapped by a mysterious stranger and chained in an eerie, dilapidated barn. Unwilling to play the victim, she plots a daring escape. With thirst and hunger bearing down, her grip on reality loosens. Can she free herself from the chain and the haunting visions? Why is she here? Is that strange presence outside the barn her imagination or the reason for her capture? Thirty Proof Coil uses brilliant acting, a dramatic location and unabashed indie enthusiasm to punch viewers right in the nose.
