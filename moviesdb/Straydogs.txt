Straydogs

 Vildhundarna is a drama far away from the Swedish reality. It's about four young people on the outermost, with norms dispersed, the only survivors in a nameless city, in a nameless country. Vildhundarna could take place in the former Yugoslavia, or why not Warszawa in 1944 or Rwanda...?
