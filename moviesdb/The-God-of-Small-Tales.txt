The God of Small Tales

 Hanif Kureishi and Akram Khan collaborate to create an examination of the stories women tell about themselves and to each other. The origin of these stories - and the theme of the piece - is the relationship of daughter to mother. The women (all in their forties, fifties, sixties and in one case her seventies) express these stories through music, movement, dance and song.
