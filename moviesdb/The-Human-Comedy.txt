The Human Comedy

 Homer Macauley remains in a small town looking after his widowed mother and younger brother. Homer's older brother is fighting the war in Europe. Recently-deceased Matthew Macauley looks down upon his family in small-town Ithaca, where eldest son Marcus has departed to await deployment for combat in the Second World War. This leaves middle son Homer to support the family, working at a telegraph station. Now the man of the family, Homer comes of age amidst the clarion call of war, even as youngest son Ulysses discovers the wonders of life, and Marcus inspires his platoon mate, foundling Toby George, with stories of idyllic Ithaca. Deceased Matthew Macauley looks over his family from heaven. Two years after his death, his second eldest son, Homer, is the de facto head of the family in light of eldest son Marcus being in the army. Teenager Homer has to look after his mother Kate, his elder sister Bess, his adolescent brother Ulysses and surrogate family member Mary Arena (their next door neighbor who is Marcus' girlfriend), who all live in the farming community of Ithaca, California. Homer gets a job after school working in the postal telegraph office as the night messenger. Homer likes much about his job, but dislikes some of the messages he needs to deliver, especially death notices from the war office. Head telegrapher, the elderly Willie Grogan, deals with the death notices in his own way. Homer's boss, Tom Spangler, is dealing with issues of where he fits into the war world. Through his current lot in life, Homer grows up quickly, as he deals with typical issues facing teenagers, such as a crush on a girl and wanting to win the 220 low hurdles race in the upcoming track meet. Meanwhile, Marcus and his new army friend Tobey George, who grew up an orphan and is looking for a place he can call home, hope they will survive the war so that they can return to a civilian life in Ithaca.
