Sujut

 A group of soldiers is left on the wrong side of the Vuoksi river when the Finnish army is retreating in the summer 1944. One of them swims cross the river although own troops mistake him for the enemy. After these experiences, he decides he has done enough for his country, as the country does not seem to need him. He walks home and starts to live his normal life again, not caring whether caught or not. Before the end, the army finds him again and makes him dig his own grave.
