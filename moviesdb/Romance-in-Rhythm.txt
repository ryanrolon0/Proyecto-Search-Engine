Romance in Rhythm

 Using a nightclub setting, Carl Hoff and His Orchestra provide the music. Band vocalist Barry McKinley sings, the Randall Sisters do their interpretation of "The Whirling Dervish." The Kidooders (Paul Cordner, Bil Kearnes, Eddie Lewis and Bob Remington) wind this Votaphone short up with "Old MacDonald Had a Farm."
