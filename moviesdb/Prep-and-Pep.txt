Prep and Pep

 A bashful, timid 17-year-old boy comes to school and finds that the whole student boy and faculty expect him to live up to his father's accomplishments at the same school. The father is regarded as the finest athlete to ever attend the school, and the son is ill-equipped or prepared to follow in his big footsteps.
