Recovering Irma

 Recovering Irma crystallizes in the aftermath of domestic violence homicide as Sandra and her nephew Lorenzo embark upon a road trip from San Francisco to her parent's hometown of El Paso. Along the way, they will piece together her mother's life, interview the people Irma loved and travel through her favorite places. Sandra and Lorenzo will also meet with perpetrators, survivors, law enforcement, domestic violence experts asking the question, 'How do we stop this?' As the road trip unfolds, Lorenzo will quickly discover this journey is a chance to see what he could become if he doesn't change. Sandra's hope is that by going back to where it all began, generations will have a chance to remember, heal, change, and ultimately be set free.
