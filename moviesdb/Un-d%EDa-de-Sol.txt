Un día de Sol

 Adolescence, the stage when desires and enthusiasm collide with reality, is the framework for the story of Sol, a 17-year-old girl whose true passion is playing soccer. Along the way, she must face the prejudices of society, and even her own father, and learn to count on friendship as the key to living her dream.
