Viceroy

 Darren Viceroy is a self-made millionaire with the very bad habit of procrastination. He never ties up the small details of his business. This fatal flaw allows a former business associate named Minnie Cambridge to implicate Darren in drug trafficking. This throws hungry FBI agents off of Minnie's trail and prompts Darren to employ his wits and far-reaching business connections to get the FBI back onto Minnie's trail... and mayhem ensues.
