Speak Easy, Second Edition.

 Real History or Revisionism is the movement that seeks to debate history and thus disprove the Jewish Holocaust called The Shoah. Were there actually Gas Chambers at Auschwitz and was there a 'Final-Solution?' Lincoln Hudson interviews Revisionist Historian David Irving and then sets out to discover the truth, and then attempts to uncover the motivating forces of Holocaust Denial. Is Free-Speech a right or a privilege, and should individuals be allowed to debate that which is history?
