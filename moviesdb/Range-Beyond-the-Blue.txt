Range Beyond the Blue

 Henry Rodgers is after Margie's stage line. He has her in trouble by having her gold shipments robbed thereby driving her insurance premiums to an unaffordable level. Eddie and Soapy arrive to help out. Eddie suspects Rodgers but when he breaks into his office, Rodgers apparently kills him. With Eddie out of the way, Rodgers makes the robbery that will put her out of business. Henchmen Kyle ('Bill Hammond (I)' (qv)), Bragg ('George Turner (IV)' (qv)) and Sneezer ('Ted French' (qv)), led by Lash Taggert ('Bob Duncan (I)' (qv)), attempt to hold up a stage driven by Margie Rodgers ('Helen Mowery' (qv)), but Eddie Dean ('Eddie Dean (I)' (qv)) and his partner Soapy Jones ('Roscoe Ates' (qv)) come riding along and drive them away. The Yucca County Sheriff ('Steve Clark (I)' (qv)) is wounded in the battle, and Eddie suggests that Soapy be made acting sheriff. Margie tells Eddie that her stagecoach has been held up each time it carries a gold shipment and her uncle, Henry Rodgers ('Ted Adams (I)' (qv)) says that is proof that the bandits are receiving advance information, but his offer to buy the line is refused by Margie. Eddie pretends to turn outlaw so the bandits will think he is on their side. While his scheme is not totally successful, he does learn that the uncle is the man tipping off the outlaws. He and Soapy intercept the message the next time Rodgers advises Taggert of a gold shipment, and the two are able to foil the holdup and prove the connection to Rodgers.
