Un homme de main

 All his life Jean-Louis has mixed up right and left. Choosing the wrong way, one day he finds himself, unwittingly, enrolled in a dance class. There, he meets the beautiful HElene, a professional manicurist. It's love at first sight. Still Jean-Louis tries to resist, convinced that his hands are tied. Can one allow the invisible hand of destiny do its work and trust in a happy end ? That, indeed, is the question for these two handsome lovers.
