The Slap-Hoppy Mouse

 Sylvester Cat takes his son, Junior, on a mouse-hunting expedition in an old, broken-down, mouse-infested house near some railroad tracks. Baby kangaroo Hippety Hopper falls out of a passing train and turns up in the house. Sylvester and Junior, as usual, mistake him for a giant mouse, and Sylvester is obliged to fight the playful Hippety.
