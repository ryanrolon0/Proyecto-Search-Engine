Son of Geronimo

 Columbia's 50th serial (between "Blackhawk" and "The Lost Planet") and made during the production season, 1952-53, when Clayton Moore left "The Lone Ranger" television series and was replaced by John Hart for a year. Story has frontier trouble-shooter Jim Scott seeking to put an end to the bloodshed between whites and Indians on the Western frontier. He is aided by Tulsa, the boss of a wagon train, and by frontier settlers Frank Baker and his sister Ann. A band of Apaches headed by Porico, son of Geronimo, continually attack the settlers, their wagon trains and a new stage line. In vain Jim seeks a meeting with Geronimo. A band of white renegades, led by Ace Devlin and Rance Rankin, manage to worsen the situation. After scores of savage battles and hair-raising escapes (14 to be exact, as Chapter 15, "The Peace Treaty," had no need for a cliffhanger), Jim succeeds in killing or capturing the outlaws, and convinces Porico to arrange a peace-accomplishing mission with Geronimo.
