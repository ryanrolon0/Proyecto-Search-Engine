The Bold Bank Robbery

 Three well-dressed men are taken by a servant to a home where they change clothes. The four of them summon a car, and after being driven a short ways, they overpower the driver and leave him bound and unconscious by the roadside. They proceed to rob a bank vault and then try to make their escape, with police pursuing them across the city.
