Sin querer

 Mario, a young, handsome surveyor, arrives in a small Patagonian town to prepare the overland transport of a passenger ship. The inhabitants eagerly await the trek, some hoping it will establish a better link to the outside world, others just sensing an opportunity to make money. No only by falling in love with Gloria, who runs a garment store, is married to a wealthy hacienda owner, but also has an affair with the town's mayor, Mario gets entangled in a tight web of relations.
