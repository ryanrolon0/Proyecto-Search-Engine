The Truth of the Matter

 'The Truth of the Matter' presents two girls sitting in suits, drinking tea in the rain. The background frames show us images of their current thoughts, feelings, and day dreams. In order for the characters to understand each other's perspective they must first emerge from their respective worlds and relate to one another. In doing so, they are able to better understand their own frame of mind.
