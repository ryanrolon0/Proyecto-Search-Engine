Swamp Devil

 Sweet young Melanie Blaine returns to her small backwoods country hometown of Gibbington to check on her estranged ex-sheriff father Howard, who's the primary suspect in a series of grisly murders. Nice guy local Jimmy Fuller helps Melanie out. Melanie eventually finds her dad and discovers that something not human and much more sinister than a mere mortal man is responsible for the killings.
