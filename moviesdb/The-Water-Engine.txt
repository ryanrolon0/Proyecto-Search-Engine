The Water Engine

 In the 1930s, Charles Lang invents an engine that runs using water for fuel. But when he tries to get it patented, he is first offered a ridiculously low amount. When he refuses, he is suddenly several people are pressuring him to sell. The big oil companies don't want the competition. Now he has to try and keep them from getting his idea, and somehow get it published. Key themes that provide an important backdrop for the film are the Great Depression, a sense of political and social unrest with the related issue of the powerful vs. the weak, and a sense that the country is entering an age of science that will bring great wonders to all. Lang (Macy), a drill press operator in a huge, ominous factory, cares for his blind sister (LuPone) and the two of them dream of a way to a better life with his water engine. The film is about hopes and dreams against the reality of the Depression and powerful forces.
