Romy and Michele's High School Reunion

 Romy and Michelle have been through it all including being tortured by the Popular crowd when in high school. When they recieve word of a 10 year reunion they come to realize their lives aren't as impressive as they'd like them to be. Instead of staying home they go to the reunion with buisness outfits, cell phones, and one heck of a bogus success story. Romy and Michele are two former schoolmates who have also been roommates for ten years after the time they graduated, and their lives are far from successful, they can't even get a date. As the 10-year class reunion approaches they try to do something to make an impression on other former schoolmates and finally decide to act as though they are very rich business women who invented Post-Its.
