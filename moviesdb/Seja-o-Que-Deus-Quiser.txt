Seja o Que Deus Quiser

 Cacá, a VJ who works for São Paulo MTV, comes to Rio de Janeiro to make a report about a new band, whose members are poor and live in a slum called Morro do Alemão. She spends the night with PQD, one of the musicians. The next day, Cacá is attacked by two street kids who wanted some money, and thinks PQD is somehow involved. With the police chasing him, PQD decides to go to São Paulo to see Cacá and prove his innocence. But he meets Cacá's brother, Nando, who tries to convince him to take part in a scam.
