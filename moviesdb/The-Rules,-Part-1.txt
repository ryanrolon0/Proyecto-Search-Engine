The Rules, Part 1

 An actress (Jane) auditions for the role of a prostitute in an independent film. The director (Bill) asks her to strip to prove that she has the mettle for the part. She balks; after all, there was no mention of nudity in the notice. Besides, it's only her and the director in this tiny room. The director pitches Jane on the necessity of doing the strip - it's integral to the role and he can't take the chance that she won't do it come shooting day. The soft sell doesn't work. But the hard sell seems to do the trick.
