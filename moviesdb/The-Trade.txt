The Trade

 In the post-apocalyptic West, two men have found a place to call home. They guard their base in an abandoned junkyard, keep one another company, and try to pass the endless hours upon days upon years. But when a lone stranger, a female trader from the outside world, stumbles upon their camp, things instantly change. The younger man is intrigued. The older man is wary. And the trader is cutthroat, willing to do whatever she needs to get whatever she wants.
