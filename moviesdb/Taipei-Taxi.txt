Taipei Taxi

 I recorded part of a taxi driver and another passenger's conversation on the way to the Taipei Airport. I do not speak Mandarin, so I didn't understand what they were saying as I recorded it. Recently I had the audio translated. Taipei Taxi reveals the surprising story that the driver shared with a passenger that day.
