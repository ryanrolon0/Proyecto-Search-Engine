Sell It to the Hedge Funds

 Composed exclusively from the footage of real-life cold calls, Sell It to the Hedge Funds follows ace phone salesman Haven Pell on a cold caller's mission impossible sales pitch. Comedy, drama and tutorial all intermingle in this highly stylized, fast-paced four minute film.
