The Mischievous Boys and the Washerwoman

 While busily engaged at her occupation the washerwoman is annoyed by the mischievous boys, who throw lighted fire-crackers at her from a window nearby. She retaliates by sousing the boys with a convenient piece of wet linen. This enrages the boys, who proceed to deposit a lighted pack in such close proximity to her heels that she is compelled to beat a precipitous retreat, with the tub, suds and clothes in a somewhat inverted order. A side-splitting picture sure to win a laugh.
