Probe

 Pilot for sci-fi detective series "Search." Hugh O'Brian as Lockwood, a high-tech private eye, was outfitted with two electronic implants (one to hear what was said at HQ and a dental contact he could bite to communicate with HQ--one bite for yes and two bites for no) and a button-sized "scanner" that combined a micro-miniaturized television camera that could also see in infrared spectrum, microphone, medical sensors, and transmitter, putting him in constant contact with a room full of experts monitoring his actions and vital signs and supplying him with encyclopedic information. Burgess Meredith as Cameron, Lockwood's "head kibitzer." Story involves missing diamonds. Series plots tended to be "missing object(s) or person(s)"-type detective stories, rather than murder "whodunits" or "howcatchems."
