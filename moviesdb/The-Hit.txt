The Hit

 Upon being released from jail, George, hears that his friends think he snitched them out. Not wanting to wait at his house he wanders next door to wait with his neighbors who aren't home. Instead a little old lady answers the door, good enough, George barges right in...not realizing he has just jumped out the frying pan and into the fire.
