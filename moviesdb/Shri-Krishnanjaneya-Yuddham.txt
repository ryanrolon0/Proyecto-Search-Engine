Shri Krishnanjaneya Yuddham

 When a Hindu Hermit complains to Bhagwan Shri Kishan that his prayers have been interrupted and he has been humiliated, the later decides to use his Sudarshan Chakra to behead the culprit, Chitrasen. No one dares to oppose Kishanji until Subhadra convinces her spouse, Kuntiputra Arjun to intervene - resulting in a battle that may well destroy the universe as well as Arjun, his brothers, and the entire Pandava army.
