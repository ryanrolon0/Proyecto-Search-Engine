Une heure pres de toi

 AndrE and Colette Bertier are happily married. But Mitzi, an old school chum of Colette's, resurfaces out of the blue. As her marriage is on the rocks she has no better idea than to seduce AndrE. AndrE tries hard to resist but what could he do with that Mitzi? Colette decides to be revenged thanks to Adolph, AndrE's friend, who yearns for her. Happily, all ends well that ends well.
