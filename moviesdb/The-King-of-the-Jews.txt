The King of the Jews

 The King of the Jews is a film centered on Christianity and the hypocritical ideals that are preached and practiced in churches all over the country. The King of the Jews vividly depicts, through the life of one man, how such prejudice, hate, and ignorance can severely damage the life and emotional well-being of anyone subjected to such neglect and deceit. It analyzes the church's tendency to not follow that which they preach -- and ultimately tries to bring the focus of back to the universal and secular ideal of love and compassion. It is a beautiful film full of emotion, intellect, and truth. It is a story of hope for the helpless, and compassion for the suffering, and truth in the face of lies.
