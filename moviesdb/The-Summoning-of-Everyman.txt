The Summoning of Everyman

 God instructs Death to collect the soul of Everyman and bring him to his final judgment. Everyman, unable to bribe Death, must then seek a companion to join him on his journey to face his reckoning before God. Abandoned by Fellowship, Cousin, Kindred, and Worldly Goods, Everyman approaches Good Deeds, who alone will accompany him to the very end of his journey.
