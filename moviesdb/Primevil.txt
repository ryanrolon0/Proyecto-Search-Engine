Primevil

 In the year 25,000 B.C., a Cro-Magnon Hunter tracks three Neanderthals who've murdered his mate and kidnapped his child. Will he find them in time to save his child from being sacrificed to their heathen god? Inspired in equal measure by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Frank Frazetta and Robert E. Howard, Primevil is a tale of revenge and horror set before the dawn of recorded history.
