Sibylline Fracture

 As a part-time Atchafalaya Basin resident, I am very passionate about the waters of Louisiana. This is my response to the BP spill. Its origin stems from personal experience. I was playing cards in L'Anse Bleu, Louisiana on a spring afternoon when one of the players at my table received a call young family member had just been killed during the BP rig explosion. At that moment we were unaware of the magnitude of the spill disaster, but what I experienced was a fracture in the continuum of life. We didn't know then that the fracture was a foreshadowing of dreadful events to come, the Sibyl speaking. The video synthesizes my Louisiana swamp footage, oil related graphics, and my sense memory of that afternoon.
