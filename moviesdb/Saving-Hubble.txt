Saving Hubble

 Since ancient times, humankind has gazed upon the stars above and wondered about the meaning of the universe. How did it all begin? Are we alone or are there other beings among the billions of galaxies beyond our comprehension? Filmmaker and journalist David Gaynes wants to find out. That's why he's been traveling across America on a quest that he and millions of others share. The journey of SAVING HUBBLE. Touching down in America amid the troubles of a new century, Saving Hubble examines NASA's unpopular decision to cancel the famed Hubble Space Telescope in 2004. The film cleverly deconstructs the proposed cancellation and the movement to save it, always with a nod toward the quirk, the curiosity, and the existential wonder of space. Saving Hubble is ultimately a story about people finding their voices and a love letter that stands as humanity's ambassador to the expanding universe.
