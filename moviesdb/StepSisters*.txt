StepSisters*

 StepSisters is an intimate character-driven story chronicling the lives of two best friends as they come of age and try to hold on to their friendship amidst the temptations and traditions of one of America's prestigious Historically Black Colleges. Think Dawson's Creek meets Stomp the Yard. Christina Randolph and Angela Nixon have been best friends since they met in third grade. Growing up in upper middle-class families in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, the fact that Christina is white and Angela is African-American has never been an issue of concern. But as they step onto the campus of Frederick University (known as "The Fred" by students and alumni), everything changes. Suddenly Christina's race makes her stick out like a sore thumb. And as a college freshman, where blending in is the name of the game, standing out is not always a good thing. Christina not only has to learn how to cope with the trials and tribulations of college life, she has to prove that she belongs. To Angela, Christina has never been her "white friend", just her best friend. But now that they are at The Fred, the differences between the two are becoming much starker. As the feisty, outgoing one of the pair, Angela is normally never one to bow to social pressure. So the awkward glances and occasional whispers and odd questions don't bother her at first. But as the lure of popularity becomes stronger, she finds herself faced with decisions about where her loyalties lie...to the best friend from her past or to the future that she is trying to build for herself among her new peers, some of whom don't always look too kindly to her being friends with someone who is so different from them. Furthermore, the division between the two friends is intensified by their decision to join rival sororities. So much so that their friendship devolves into one of pure hatred.
