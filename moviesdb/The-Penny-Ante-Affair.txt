The Penny-Ante Affair

 'The Penny Affair' is the tale of Darren Golightly, accounts programming manager for Suffolk World Bank. Darren is a lot like the rest of us-we all have minor compulsions now and again, a song we can't get out of our head, walking on the same side of the street-but Darren's compulsion becomes an obsession. Unfortunately for him, that's when Tracey comes along.
