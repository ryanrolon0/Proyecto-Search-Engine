Shambler

 Brilliant multi M.D. Samuel Pratt obsessed with extending life. He finds previously lost Egyptian procedures said to raise the dead. When the mob shows up, shoots him, and steals his research, his lab assistants inject him with the life giving serum. They have now created the Shambler, a mummified version of the good doctor who is now hell bent on both revenge, completing his mission, and helping his one true love, before his time runs out.
