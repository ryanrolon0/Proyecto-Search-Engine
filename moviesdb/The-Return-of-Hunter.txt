The Return of Hunter

 Rick Hunter is back. Now a lieutenant, he is considering marrying his girlfriend. But before he could, she is murdered. He suspects that it's probably her abusive ex-husband who is stalking her. But being a celebrity, Hunter's not sure if he will be tried much less convicted. But did he really, that's what Hunter is asking when someone calls him with first hand information about the murder.
