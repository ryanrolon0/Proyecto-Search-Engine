 Story of the mental and emotional crisis of a burned out film director, reduced to doing video commercials and an occasional short. Adam, the director, has never been exactly lovable mid-life he does not have much to look forward to. He has a way-out musician friend who plays strangely on a bass. The two men converse about life and death and the meaning of existence. At the end Adam kills himself with sleeping pills and the musician listens to all his old tapes.
