Racing Luck

 Brother and sister "Boots" Warren and Phyllis Warren inherit two race horses. One of the horses is claimed by a rival horse-owner, Jeff Stuart, when it wins a claiming race at Santa Anita. Then Stuart learns that the horse will not run without its former stablemate. But neither Stuart nor the Warrens want to give up their respective horses. It is finally agreed that both horses will be entered in the same race, and the winning owner will gain possession of both horses. The only complication is that Phyllis has fallen in love with Stuart.
