Sitting Ducks

 Set in the Winter of 2002, at the height of British media hysteria over the massive influx of asylum seekers into the country. Sitting Ducks is a comedy about a slightly naive group of Romany Gypsies who come to London to escape the discrimination they suffered in former Yugoslavia. Through a twist of fate they find themselves in the smart house of a television executive and his ambitious wife. Events spiral out of control when an ambitious Tory politician gets involved.
