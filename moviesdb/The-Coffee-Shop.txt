The Coffee Shop

 All Bob wanted was a simple cup of coffee. The Coffee Shop had Raspberry Lattes, All-American Mochas, and some drink called the Big Smooch. Other customers knew what they wanted in their coffee. Everything. Including a cherry on top. Bob's request for 'just coffee' brings him unwanted attention from The Coffee Shop staff, customers, and three mysterious strangers.
