The Beginning of the End

 At the end of her rope, a young woman is out alone drinking herself to death. She finds one last moment of peace through the music of a local musician, only to be interrupted by rowdy bar patrons; they beat her and leave her for dead. As she lay in an alley, all hope abandoned, she discovers an unlikely companion waiting to be saved...and to save her in return.
