The Retreat

 Three childhood friends who are living wildly different versions of an unfulfilled life magazine, Skyler is a quirky animal rights activist, and Natasha, a former dancer, is now married to a stringent corporate job. Unaware of each others' trials, all three women are brought back together when their fourth childhood friend, Onya, restarts her mother's restorative retreat in their hometown and reaches out for their help. During their week at home, the four friends find it hard to keep recent secrets from each other and are forced to honestly view the power of their life choices.
