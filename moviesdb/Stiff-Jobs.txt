Stiff Jobs

 "Stiff Jobs" is the story of two of the most ruthless hitmen in all of Strangeville, Wolfram and Windgate. What was to be a routine hit on a well-to-do gay pedophile with inclinations toward fat Cuban boys, turns into murder, mayhem and all the perverted sexual nonsense Hack Movies is known for when our heroes get themselves balls deep in supernatural jizm, and come face to face with the forces of darkness!
