Teed Off

 National Lampoon invites you to play a round with television and film star David Leisure and his hilarious troupe of not-ready-for-tee-time players as they pull some of the most outrageous pranks ever captured by a hidden camera. That's right, it's National Lampoon's Teed Off - skit-comedy inter-cut with hidden-camera hi-jinx on the links - where the boundaries of good taste and good golf are blurred by this totally uninhibited cast of cut-ups.
