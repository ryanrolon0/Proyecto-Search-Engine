The Plastic Protocol

 It's September 1986 and over-privileged, over-educated, sex-driven students dictate what's hip. Vanessa and her boyfriend Blaine have just moved from sunny Los Angeles to New York to attend a prestigious arts college. She is incredibly focused on her future, and when reluctantly paired together on a psychology project with the charismatic and charming Sebastian, she'll discover unanticipated things about the college experience. Will is a respected Teacher's Assistant by day, and a successful drug-dealer anytime else, but is perpetually pursued by beautiful sorority Queen Lilah. When she accidentally discovers something that could destroy his reputation, their situation becomes much considerably more complex. These dynamic interrelated relationships set the stage for a week that will change all of their lives forever, with all roads leading to the the traditional 'Shut Up And Dance!' recruitment party at the end of the week.
