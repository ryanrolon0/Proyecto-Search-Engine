The Big Idea

 Jake Brayburg has a problem. He has to come up with the next great idea for a sitcom and he has no clue where to start looking. His friends aren't doing much better either. Ryan is having relationship issues with an overbearing girlfriend, and Mitch continues to be crapped on at every turn. Even Jake's business partner Ernie is of little help as he's currently involved with the company door man and Jake's assistant Daisy. Things only get worse when the guys lives are turned upside down by an unexpected house guest, a homeless man, and the most dysfunctional family in America. With Hollywood execs breathing down Jake's throat, can he come up with the next big idea?
