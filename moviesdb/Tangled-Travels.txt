Tangled Travels

 A movie studio hires a new travelogue director to drive cross-country. We see his pun-filled trip, mostly drawn on photographs full of mouths; an eerie canal includes a mother-in-law in a coffin; the sap running in the Vermont woods stops to say hi; a "light" house floats away; two Southern gentlemen offer to "buy-you" a stick of gum in Louisiana; an Indian reservation in the table lands lets him order a meal; finally, he passes Palm Springs (coil springs, of course) and delivers the result to his producer in Hollywood, who promptly shoots him.
