Primal Scream

 A modern Horror/Thriller Film about young adults terrorized by a killer, the film is based on an unfinished documentary of Serial Killers by a first time Japanese filmmaker. The film recreates true to life factual accounts and is a stylish, frightening, fast paced horror-thriller that pits four self-centered, college age kids returning from a lost weekend the North East against a malicious, whip-smart, mallet-carrying Serial Killer who stalks, terrorizes, and kidnaps them in a fifteen hour rampage set in Americas Heartland.
