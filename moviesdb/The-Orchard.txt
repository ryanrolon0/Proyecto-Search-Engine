The Orchard

 Two friends become prisoners of a mysterious orchard inhabited by a breed of mute children, overseen by a doctor who takes on God's hand to give life to the unwanted. As they fight for their lives, they realize only one will make it out alive and the other must make the greatest of all sacrifices.
