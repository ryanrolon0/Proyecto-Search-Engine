Strange Attractor

 A mysterious and alluring portrayal of a couple's interplay around the cooking of an onion, while elements of internal conflict and external chaos distracts their attention from one another. Stunning colorized B&W DV, post-processed using a vintage Commodore Amiga computer. An exceptional score by musician Richard Bone.
