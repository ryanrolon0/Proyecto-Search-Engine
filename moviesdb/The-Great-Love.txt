The Great Love

 An idealistic young American during World War I, itching to fight the Germans and not wanting to wait until the U. S. joined the war, journeys to Canada and enlists in the British army. He is sent for training to England, and then to the front in Ffance, where he is wounded. Returned back to England to recuperate from his wounds, he falls in love with the daughter of an Australian minister.
