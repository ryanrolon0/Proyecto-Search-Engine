Three Beauties

 Documents the lives of women in the slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh by focusing on three girls who have never met - Labli, Julie & Ruba. Labli (7) stays home to help her mother with household activities as her dad cannot afford a school education. Julie (14) works in a garment factory for 12 hours per day, seven days a week. Her salary is $15 per month, and she gets one day off every three months. Ruba (16) is getting married, arranged by her parents, to her 25-year-old first cousin. The three stories weave together to draw a vivid picture of a unique lifestyle.
