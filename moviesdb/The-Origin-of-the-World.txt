The Origin of the World

 The structure of "The Origin of the World" revolves around one scene in which a priest/doctor removes snake filled containers from the "sacrificial victim/patient" The removal of each container prompts a different scene to play, each one based on the various aspects of the energy centers, according to Kundalini Yoga.
