Steven's Sin

 In this 15-minute short film, a nineteen-year-old Mormon missionary named Steven Brown travels to Southern California where he meets Javier, an older charismatic missionary, who exposes Steven to a world of temptation the likes of which he's never seen. As Steven's attraction and feelings for Javier grow, he is forced to re-examine his beliefs, his sexuality and his relationship to God and the Church.
