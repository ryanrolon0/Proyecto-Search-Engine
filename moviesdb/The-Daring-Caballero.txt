The Daring Caballero

 Cisco learns from the Padre that Pappy Del Rio, the town's leading citizen, is to be hung the next day for murder and robbery. The Padre thinks he is innocent so Cisco breaks him out and hides him. Cisco then runs into the Mayor, an outlaw he knows who is now using a different name. Cisco figures he is the murderer and sets out to prove it. The Cisco Kid ('Duncan Renaldo' (qv)) sets out to make a young boy happy by clearing the boy's father of a framed-up murder charge. Cisco and his sidekick, Pancho ('Leo Carrillo' (qv)), learn that the people behind the plot to frame the father is a group of crooked town officials who are using the man as a scapegoat to cover up their own crooked deeds.
