The Ballad of Jacob Wonder and Wesley Precious

 Jacob Wonder and Wesley Precious are... well, we're not sure who they are or where they're going. Turns out they're not to sure about it either. This film does not lend itself well to words - while it asks for the audience's engagement, it does not require it; while its dialogue has great meaning, its understanding is derived from its imagery; and while it purports to be of great importance, it is ultimately a story everyone has known since birth. The Ballad of Jacob Wonder and Wesley Precious is an abstract and surreal reinvention of traditional story telling that follows the journey of our heroes as they struggle to define their ambivalent dynamic whilst saving the world from fate and destruction.
