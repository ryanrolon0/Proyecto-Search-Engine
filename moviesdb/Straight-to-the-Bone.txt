 Jay and Shannon have been together since college. Now, both approaching 30, Shannon makes an understandable request for the ultimate commitment. Unfortunately, Jay does not see the need for such a legal definition of their relationship. Frustrated, Shannon seeks comfort in the arms of Blake - a new friend who seems to share her ideals about the future. Does she gamble on this new opportunity or stick it out with the one she loves - who may not be able to give her all she needs?
