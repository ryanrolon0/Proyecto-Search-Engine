Silver Patriot

 The radio reports that Dr. Chameleon's reign of terror in Rivertown may be ending soon; listening is a woman who's just called the police. They arrive and interrogate her. She's just finished a double shift at a hospital; there's a body in her flat. Did she kill him? She tries to explain. Then we see the coroner make a startling discovery, and in a flashback, we see what really happened.
