Tryumf pana Kleksa

 Tomek Milkowski is an comic-books' illustrator. But his chef doesn't like his drawings. He tells Tomek to make up something really cool, if the boy doesn't want to loose his job. The illustrator has a guest. It's a bird Tri-Tri from stories about Mr. Kleks. Tomek takes the book and decides to illustrate it as a comic book.
