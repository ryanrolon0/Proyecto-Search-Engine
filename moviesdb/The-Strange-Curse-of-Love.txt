The Strange Curse of Love

 The film is a roller-coaster thriller which will have everything you know about plot twists blended into a mess of the mind. If you like films like Pulp Fiction and U-Turn, this will be a grabber for you. Produced by Sour Bamboo Productions and directed by Malek Haneen who worked on such films as Loaded, Traitor, and several VH1 videos. The entire film is based in Idaho, primarily the Boise area using local shops, homes, restaurants and our whole crew and talent resides in Idaho! We hope to be finished with the production Spring of 2010 and will be premiering in various theaters and showing at several film festivals.
