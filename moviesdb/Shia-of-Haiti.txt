Shia of Haiti

 On January 31st 2010, two American Muslims set out on a mission to help a community of hundreds in the earthquake torn country of Haiti. A mission which began solely as a humanitarian effort turns into a spiritual awakening for the two in a weeks span in a shattered land. Equipped with only a camcorder they documented their journey as they interviewed locals, engaged in heartbreaking conversations, and photographed a devastated Haiti, which is in a desperate need of help!
