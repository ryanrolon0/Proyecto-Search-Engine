Tin seung yan gaan

 This film gets under the skin of a very marginalized group immigrants to Hong Kong from Mainland China. Belying the expectation that they will belong in a territory now returned to China's sovereignty, they find themselves lonely, frustrated, poor and employable only in the most menial jobs from elevator service staff to prostitution.
