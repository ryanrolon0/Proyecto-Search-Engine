Sommaren

 Torun and Mikael have been married for a few years. When vacationing by the Danish coast, their young son Melker accidently drowns. Torun initially blames her sister, who was supposed to supervise her children. Later she turns her anger and grief against her husband. Since none of them know what to do with their feelings, they start to drift apart.
