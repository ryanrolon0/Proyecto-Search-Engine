Them as Themselves

 Shown at the John Anson Ford Theater in Los Angeles, CA as part of a evening Dance concert, longtime dance/choreographer collaborators McNamee and Bubba Carr did a duet which was then scored by a composer team including Dan Shulman of the band Garbage, after the picture was edited providing a new type of collaboration between dance, film and music. This unique approach to Dance cinema proved to be very remarkable.
