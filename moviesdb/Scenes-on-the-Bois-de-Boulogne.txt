Scenes on the Bois de Boulogne

 The passing crowds on this great boulevard are always interesting to watch. Bicyclists, pedestrians, carriages and cabs whirl by in kaleidoscopic profusion. A steam train enters in the distance, marking its route with light puffs of steam. An interesting feature of the picture is the pool of water on the crossing in the foreground which causes temporary embarrassment to some of the ladies who are obliged to take long strides to step over same.
