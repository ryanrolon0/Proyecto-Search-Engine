Space Samurai

 One man aboard the International Space Station Oasis thinks there's a weapon of mass destruction embedded within this eighth wonder of the world. Some assembly required. He must decide the fate of the society, and possibly all humanity from enemy global domination. But, no one else on the station or Earth believes him. Now, in a race against the clock, he must prove his own sanity, and save civilization.
