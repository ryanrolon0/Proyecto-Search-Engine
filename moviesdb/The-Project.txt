The Project

 Is it mere curiosity? The project is so secret that nobody working on it knows the whole story, and they aren't allowed to ask questions. Neil Fulton, however, feels the need to know. Others on the team had been mysteriously reassigned without explanation. After Grimes, his supervisor, suffers a mental breakdown, Fulton has one chance to get some answers. With a stolen access card, he ventures into the heart of the project to see what Grimes had seen. There he sees the creature the chamber was designed to contain. The chamber he designed. Is it just curiosity or something darker? Why would he follow in Grimes' footsteps when he would most likely share the same fate?
