There Is a Hippie on the Highway

 It is a story of Harry Mitchell, an ex-paratrooper who looked forward to have a peaceful time in Paradise City. But when he got there, he is drawn into a lethal set-up where dumped corpses, smuggling operations, hired killers, over-ambitious cops and a nymphomaniac double-crosser called Nina tend to make his life hell.
