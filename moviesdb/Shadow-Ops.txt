Shadow-Ops

 "Shadow-Ops" A group of young intelligence operatives, former employees of the military, the State Department and the CIA, have formed a company of their own, using their expertise to get what they need--even if it means parachuting into dangerous situations in hostile territory. In order to help a woman claiming to be a former Soviet military scientist, the team parachutes into Cuba and manages to retrieve what she claims is a stolen biological weapon from a heavily-guarded villa. After escaping from Cuba, the team learns that their client, and their "friends" in the U.S. government, are not who they thought they were.
