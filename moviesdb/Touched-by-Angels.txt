Touched by Angels

 How does one rise up in the ranks of the holy order of angels? By making one's Boss happy. Mezudio is an angel second class joined by his angel in training Kyle Tyler, once a demon now seeking his wings. Together they've been given an assignment that could bring them both up in the world. Mike Vasquez is a washed up rocker destined for greatness. If Mezudio and Kyle Tyler can help the down and out singer write the song he was meant to write, they just might save the world...and get promoted.
