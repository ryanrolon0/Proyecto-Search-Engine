The Forgotten Step

 An American art collector, living in France in the 1870s, loses his fortune in a stock--market crash. He conceives a perfect plan to recoup his loss. His scheme is to place his collection aboard a ship going to the United States, insure the collection far beyond its value, and place a barrel of dynamite with a clock-piece timed to go off when the ship is at sea. But, on the day of sailing, a heavy snowstorm hit, and the dray carrying the barrel skidded when approaching the pier and prematurely exploded, killing the would-be master criminal and would-be mass murderer.
