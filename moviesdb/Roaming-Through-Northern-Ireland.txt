Roaming Through Northern Ireland

 A look primarily at the beauty of the countryside and seacoast, starting at Carrick-a-Rede Island then on to Enniskillen, the cathedral at Downpatrick, an appreciation of Medieval Irish craft and architecture, visits to a peat farm and the ruins of Castle Dunluce, and the pastoral beauty of County Down. There we visit the resort seacoast town of Bangor. It's on to Cushendun in County Antrim, watching two pedestrians pass each other on a swinging bridge, and finishing at the Giant's Causeway, where the narrator tells folktales as we examine fascinating rock formations and the mysteries of creation.
