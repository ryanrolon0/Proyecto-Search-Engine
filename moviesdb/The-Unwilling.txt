Paid handsomely for his "wet work", he uses real estate sales as a front to wreak fatal vengeance on cheating spouses. A chance encounter with a beautiful single mother soon wears away at the hardened edges of Edward's corrupt world. Jenny's patient influences lead Edward away from his life of murder, but Edward's partner in crime, Freddo Malatesta, proves to be more than Edward has bargained for. When Edward blows off a very important hit, Freddo takes matters into is own hands and sets out to finish the job. Edward faces the bleak truth that he cannot continue to exist in two opposing worlds. He must choose to risk his life or lose the new world that calls to him.
