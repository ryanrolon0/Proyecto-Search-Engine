Tourette Syndrome

 Du Ballon Rouge is an annual camp exclusively for children with Tourette Syndrome (TS), a neurological movement disorder. Due to the various symptoms of TS, such as involuntary vocal and motor tics and severe OCD and ADHD, many of the children do not have friends outside of camp. For one weekend, in the hill country of Texas, these kids have the rare opportunity to socialize and be themselves, free from teasing, judgment, and embarrassment. Just FUN!! Get perspectives from the campers themselves, counselors, and parents on life with TS and the magical transformation that takes place at Camp Du Ballon Rouge.
