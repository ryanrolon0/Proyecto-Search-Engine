Searching for Church

 Join filmmaker Gary T. Smith as he travels from America to Europe, across Europe to the edge of Asia, and back to America in search of an answer to the question, "What makes up a New Testament type of church?" His journey (through both time and place) leads to discoveries that might surprise you. From ancient Israel to modern day America, you'll hear how the church got started, how it changed from its simple beginnings, and you'll find out what's happening to help it return to a simpler form of meeting.
