The Party Beyond Obama

 The Party Beyond Obama" serves up an inside out look at local politics on the Lower East Side. Harry Moncrief is a black republican ward leader in the projects. He has just one day to register a candidate or he is out of a job. Harry's pleas are rejected one by one by his sparse band of eccentric party members. In his desperation, he ends up running a half white half black albino janitor, Arnold Caesar, who is genetically linked to George Washington, George Washington Carver, and Sitting Bull.
