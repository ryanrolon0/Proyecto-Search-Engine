The Opposite of Sex

 A 16 year old Louisiana girl moves in with her homosexual half-brother and immediately starts coming on to his sexual partner, finally forcing him into an affair in which she becomes pregnant. The whole affair blows into a scandal exposing her school teacher brother and the true parent of the child is called into question as it is revealed that there have been a series of lovers. Dede Truitt is a perky teenager who manages to destroy the lives of everyone she meets--including her gay brother, his lover, and their friend. On the death of her stepfather, cynical sexy young Dede Truitt heads off and moves in with her gay schoolteacher half-brother Bill. Seducing his partner Matt, she then announces she is pregnant, and disappears with him. Bill meanwhile is falsely accused of past sexual misconduct at school by one of Matt's ex-lovers, causing much media attention. As the situation snowballs, the only person who sees what Dedee is up to is Bill's rather frustrated acid-tongued sister-in-law Lucia.
