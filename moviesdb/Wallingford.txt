Wallingford

 This documentary covers the long and illustrious history of the Oxfordshire Town of Wallingford from its beginning as a prehistoric ford across the Thames to its pivotal role in English history. It shows how it became Alfred the Great's leading fortified town in Saxon times and one of William the Conqueror's early allies when its citizen's allowed his army to cross the Thames. It tells the story of Richard of Wallingford, the Father of Modern Timekeeping and Sir William Blackstone, the celebrated judge whose legal writings became the basis of the U.S. Constitution. In modern times it tells of the town's long connection with Agatha Christie, the Queen of Crime Fiction, who lived there for over 40 years.
