Rubout

 In this dark comedy, two Italian American brothers whose father is a mob-genre character actor, desperately try to reinvent themselves. Paul, a failed novelist, finds inspiration with a role-playing masseuse who teaches him the literary value of fantasy exploration. Peter is a frustrated seminarian whose Siddhartha-like foray into the outside world of sex and drag queens forces him to confront his real desires. The brothers' fantastical journey leads them to deceit, betrayal, eroticism, and murder.
