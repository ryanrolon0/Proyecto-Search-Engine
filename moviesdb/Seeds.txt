 Fox, is the catalyst to the sins of six strangers and their subjection to fault and fallibility. After provoking the sins, Fox lures the six into the last place they would think to find evil, a church. Is Fox Savior or Devil? The sins are given until morning to "save" themselves or return to dust by means of the world's end. As Fox shadows over the sins and their spirits face a dead end, the six left must make an eternal choice.
