Van Gogh los

 November 2nd 2004 Theo van Gogh is killed under the filmmaker's window. Although he's an eye-witness, he decides not to film. The windows remain his frame towards the outside world. The filmmaker asks himself why he did nothing, the morning of the fatal shots. Van Gogh had insulted his mother and was now lying dead under his window. The self-proclaimed mayor patrols the area with his big Mastif-dog and cries about his little neighborhood. He claims to have shot Mohammed B. (Van Gogh's assassin), if he'd have reached the scene of the crime earlier. The artist tries to give meaning to the spot by placing a canvas on the bullet holes, but reality overwhelms him. Slowly the facts around the murder dissolve to make place for its personal signification. The film is a personal search into guilt and punishment.
