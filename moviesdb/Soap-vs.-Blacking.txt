Soap vs. Blacking

 A man is seen blacking his shoes in a great hurry, preparatory to going to meet some friends with whom he has an appointment. Suddenly his room door is thrown open and two of his chums enter in rather a dilapidated condition. Two basins of water are handy, and he requests his chums to wash up and make themselves presentable. They take off their coats and vests and throw them at him. Then both proceed to wash. While they are washing he substitutes the blacking for soap, and one of them blackens himself up. The one who has blackened his face notices the hilarity of his friends and, upon looking in the mirror, sees the joke is on him. He blames the wrong man for it, and by way of punishment throws the basin of water all over him, but quickly gets a ducking in return. The picture then reverses, and the water is seen to come back to the basin, the blacking is soon rubbed off the man's face, their clothes fly back in their places on the men, and they make their exit backwards. An extremely interesting subject.
