Tarzan Goes to India

 Princess Kamara asks Tarzan to come to India. A huge dam is going to be opened in order to form a lake which will service an electric power plant. When the lake is formed, hundreds of elephants will be drowned ... unless Tarzan and Jai can save them. Opposition comes from the head engineer of the project. Indian Princess Kamara calls for the assistance of her government in ensuring the building of a dam in a much disputed site in India, involving several hundred elephants. When no help is forthcoming, she confers with her palace officials - who advise her to summon the ape man - Tarzan. She sends an emissary to fetch Tarzan. The Emissary locates Tarzan in the deep jungles of Africa, and manages to convince him to come to Kamara's assistance. Tarzan travels to India, and it is here that he will face the challenge of commandeering close to 300 elephants - who may or may nor understand his commands, and may be drowned.
