 Arthur Rimbaud was a wonderful poet but also an eccentric. And eccentricity is still present in 2006 in Charleville-MEzieres, his home town. Rimbaud's grave has become the place where weird rituals take place. And in the town itself, off-beat and quirky fellows perpetuate the spirit of the poet in their own fashion, be it a homeless book-lover or a an amateur archaeologist able to read in the fossils he finds in the forest. The placid witnesses of this lunacy are the two employees who look after the cemetery.
