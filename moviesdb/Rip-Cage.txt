Rip Cage

 What could compare to the torture of a trapped and lost soul? What could compare to the horror of existing one step closer to complete decay? Welcome to the next level in death; welcome to the place where reality has been bent inwards-out - where nothing is as it seems and where bliss and peace are things of the past. Welcome to the cage! These seven strangers all share the same wish, the same goal and the same reasons for being here. In this place, the only thing that matters is to avoid dying... or perhaps, to avoid staying alive for too long. When reality goes out and surreal nightmares are left in it's place, there's only one thing that is certain; pain.
