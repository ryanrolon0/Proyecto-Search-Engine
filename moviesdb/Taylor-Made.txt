Taylor Made

 Phil Taylor lives in the northern NSW town of Murwillumbah and occasionally sells second hand cars at "Taylor Made Car Sales and Hire". Every year his family enters a float in the town's annual Banana festival but this year a cloud of smoke surrounds Phil's entry to the parade. With a cast of hillbillies, three legged dogs, banana queens and classic old timers,Taylor Made is a warm and amusing look at life in small country town that time almost forgot.
