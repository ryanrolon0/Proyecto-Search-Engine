Sleeping Awake

 Having given up her passion for dance, Rosiana now suffers from insomnia and an emptiness towards life. When the rare slumber does descend, it is plagued by a recurring dream- a face, a tune that weighs down on her days and suffocates her nights until she meets Ishaan. Ishaan encourages Rosiana to dance again.. And Rosiana finds herself smiling again, sleeping again! But that dream still lingers... What's that face? What's the tune....
