Vikend na mrtovci

 Very black and grotesque comedy about the little office-worker Tase and his death wife Kata. She died in hospital in Skopje, the capitol of Macedonia, but the nurses mixed bodies of deaths. Then he must make exchange of bodies with Klime, the banker. But Tase lives in Prilep and Klime lives even in Ohrid... Then it becomes tragicomedy!
