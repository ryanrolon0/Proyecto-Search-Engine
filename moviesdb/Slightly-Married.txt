Slightly Married

 Mary Smith is picked up by the police and is about to be sentenced, in night court, to jail for vagrancy. But a stranger, Jimmie Martin, stands up and tells the judge that Mary was waiting for him and they were going to be married. A minister stands up and offers to perform the ceremony. Mary is appreciative to her 'new' husband for saving her from jail, but she sees him as a rich playboy who got drunk and decided to be gallant. She gives him instructions to move on, but he persists on taking care of his wife. And about the time she has decided that she loves him, his parents show up with lots of objections.
