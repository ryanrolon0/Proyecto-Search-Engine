Sundown Valley

 Gunsight Hawkins has developed a new gunsight for the Army. His daughter is in charge of production and Steve is the personnel manager trying to keep the men on the job. Baxter is out to stop them and tries to lure the workers into his casino. When that fails he sends a man to kill Steve. Rancher Steve Denton accepts a job with "Gun-Sight" Hawkins in his rangeland factory devoted to production of his gun-sight for U.S. Army use. Steve gets nearby ranchers and hands to work the swing shift. All goes well until "Cab" Baxter and Bart Adams buy a roadside tavern and turn it into a saloon and gambling hall. Absenteeism at the plant skyrockets and Steve and Baxter's henchmen get into repeated fights. Hawkins is notified by the government that production at the plant must be doubled. The death of one of the workers in a mêlEe in Baxter's saloon sobers the other workers and they return to their production jobs. The gang members are arrested for murder and the casino is converted into a recreation center for the workers and their families.
