Summertime Switch

 Young punk Freddie Egan is in a juvenile detention center for the summer. Spoiled rich-kid Frederick Egan III is going to a luxurious summer camp. However, a name mix-up at the bus terminal sends the boys to each other's destinations, and while Eddie gets a taste of the good life, Frederick learns some valuable life-lessons from his stay in jail.
