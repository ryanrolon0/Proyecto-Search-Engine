Sound of Mind

 Former mental patient Richard Keene, who suffers from claustrophobia and has abnormally acute powers of hearing, thinks he hears a woman being murdered behind the closed door of a Philadelphia high-rise apartment, a horror that parallels an experience from his childhood. As he meticulously sorts out the sounds he heard, Richard (who works as an audiologist) becomes obsessed with proving that a murder has been committed, before the many doubters he encounters have him committed once again.
