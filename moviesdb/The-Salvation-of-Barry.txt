The Salvation of Barry

 THE SALVATION OF BARRY "The Salvation of Barry" is the story of Barry, a thirty-something, acerbic New York business owner who has found success but not fulfillment. At the beginning of our story, we find Barry in the fight of his life with a monstrous illness. After years of therapy and several attempts at finding a cure, to no avail, Barry decides to try to find peace of mind through the one avenue he hasn't explored - religion, spirituality, and God. Barry vows to meet with representatives of many religions and spiritual philosophies and do whatever they require of him in order to find true happiness and possibly salvation. What follows is a unique documentary series that ranges from heartbreaking to hilarious and disturbing to inspiring as Barry and God play a cosmic game of 'Hide-and Seek'.
