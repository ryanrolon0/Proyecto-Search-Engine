The Ivy League

 Matthew Klein is a card-carrying wimp and painfully thin man who wears layers of clothing to inflate his appearance. He reaches the height of humiliation when he catches his gold digging Fiancee screwing a porn star named Pirate Jack. Dejected and degraded, he leaves Atlanta for small town New York, but finds himself again in a series of humiliating Hijacks with his childhood misfit friends, in his attempt to reclaim a lost love, and the town's old glory in reopening his grandfathers cheese shop.
