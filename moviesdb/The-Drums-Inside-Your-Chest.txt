The Drums Inside Your Chest

 THE DRUMS INSIDE YOUR CHEST is a performance poetry concert film that captures all of the humor, dirt, song and fire of seven award-winning young American poets during a special Los Angeles performance. At turns spine tingling, heart wrenching, gut funny and seriously profound, DRUMS offers a raucous new vision of contemporary poetry from some of the most unique younger voices in America.
