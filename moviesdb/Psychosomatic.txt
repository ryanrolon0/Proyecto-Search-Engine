A man is accused of murder, a woman who has forgotten reality is confronted with her demons and a desperate neighbour fantasises of a life with her. Why does the street's inhabitants have a history of mental illness scarred into its past? Are the plants exhumed fumes affecting the town's sanity? And what really happened when David met Ruth.
