The Drummer Man

 This "Name Band Musical" short from Universal (production number 3302), filmed in November of 1947 and released on December 3, 1947 (which should make it a 1947 and not a 1948 film) features 'Gene Krupa' (qv), his drums and his trio. It opens with Krupa and the trio playing "Lover" and then 'Carolyn Grey' (qv) comes on to sing "Boogie Blues." Krupa and the trio band also play "Blanchette", "Stompin' at the Savoy" and end on "Let Us Leap."
