The Magic Pony Ride

 The clichE of the girl pulling off her glasses and becoming beautiful is taken to the ultimate extreme by Jennifer, who wears glasses without frames, is poorly treated by her companions, and is forbidden to ride a pony. One of the ponies, Corney is going to be taken away because he is clumsy and no one can ride him. Ducklings and swans appear throughout the film, as the magical Balloon Man shows so much more.
