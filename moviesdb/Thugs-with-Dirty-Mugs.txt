Thugs with Dirty Mugs

 Killer and his gang are robbing every bank in town in numerical order, except they skip the 13th National Bank. The police are unable to catch them, despite their predictability (and their endless sight gags). Finally, they get help from an unlikely source who sat through the picture before. They capture Killer, and he gets a long sentence, which he has to write on the blackboard 1,000 times.
