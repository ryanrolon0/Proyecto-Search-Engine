The Genie with the Light Touch

 Con man Buzz Buzzard is standing outside a pool hall, flipping a coin, when a white mouse walks by him. He quickly takes the mouse in hand and offers him $2 for a favor; the mouse is to act as a genie in a fake magic lamp Buzz plans to sell. The lamp ends up being sold to Woody Woodpecker, but Buzz refuses to pay the mouse off. When both realize they have been swindled, they both decide to work together to get their share back.
