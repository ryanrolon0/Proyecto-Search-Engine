 Tadej and Lana, a young couple, are struggling through the world of drugs, dealers, addicts and prostitution. He is addicted to heroin and she is trying to help her boyfriend. When she realizes that all her efforts are in vain she becomes so desperate that she decides to take heroin herself in order to show Tadej how weak he is. Unfortunately the drug is stronger then her too and a year later she finds herself in the same situation. Now they are both in continuous search for daily fix. They owe vast sums of money to the drug dealers, she starts selling her body and their life becomes constant hell. They are sinking deeper and deeper in the cruel reality of lost opportunities and utopian wishes. There is only one end of their story; hitting the bottom of society and below. The script was based on various true stories of drug addicts. So the film was shot almost in documentary manners, because our goal was to build up an authentic reflection of a life and death of an average heroin addict.
