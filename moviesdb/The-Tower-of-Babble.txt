The Tower of Babble

 Three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings. A corrupt cop is more interested in the money on the criminals he catches than justice; a young woman discovers she's pregnant, and her boyfriend is unfeeling; and a young man calls a prostitute it's the first time for both, and neither can go through with it. Ultimately, all the stories come together.
