The Smoker

 An English teacher at a prestigious all-girls school is invited to dinner at the home of one of his students. A beautiful senior in his class has decided that he would be the perfect husband for her -- not because she's in love with him but because she thinks they would be a good match. The idea is supported by her eccentric parents, who encourage them to get married.
