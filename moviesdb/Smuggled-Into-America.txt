Smuggled Into America

 Some Chinese immigrants attempt to enter the U.S. illegally, with the principal story being the misadventures of one man who tries to have himself smuggled across the Mexican border in a barrel after customs inspectors search the steamship on which several of them arrived. His accomplice attempts to transport the barrel safely, but the runaway barrel meets with a train and a case of dynamite, among other obstacles. Another man tries to disguise himself as an Irishman to get around the anti-Chinese laws.
