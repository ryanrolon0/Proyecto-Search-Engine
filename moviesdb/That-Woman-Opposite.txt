That Woman Opposite

 A series of daring robberies has taken place on Rue des Anges, a quiet street in the town of La Bandelette. Standing by an open window in his study, Sir Maurice Lawes sees a gendarme beaten to death and the killer, who also sees Lawes, escape in a car. The next evening, the residents hear a shattering scream from Janice Lawes when she finds her father murdered. Chief Inspector Garon of the French police and private investigator Dermot Kinross are puzzled as to who would find to kill the kindly Lawes; was it divorcEe Eve Atwood whose bloodstained nightdress had been found by the police; or the son of the house, Toby, who had been secretly robbing his father to close the lips of his blackmailing mistress; or a case of robbery with violence, as a valuable necklace had been stolen from Sir Maurice's famous collection; or the burglar who feared Sir Maurice had seen him kill the gendarme?
