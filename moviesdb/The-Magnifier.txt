The Magnifier

 A sunny day in the park. Different creatures try to amuse themselves in the park, one of them "the magnifier". Inexperienced and unaware of his nature, he does not foresee the fatal combination that he and his physical attributes incur with the shining sun approaches. His time in the park becomes intolerable for him, until he eventually learns to accept his own nature and starts to enjoy life.
