This is My Land... Hebron

 Hebron is the largest city in the middle of the occupied West Bank, 30 kilometers south of Jerusalem. Hebron is famous as a holy city, a place of pilgrimage for the Jews, Christians and Muslims because Abraham, the forefather of the three most important monotheistic religions, is buried there. Today Hebron is a city of violence and hate.
