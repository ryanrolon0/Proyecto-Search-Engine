Procession of Giant Elephants in India

 Taken at the gorgeous Delhi Durbar. These elephants are the largest in captivity. The howdahs which they carry are made of the most expensive material and are decorated with precious metals and gems of all kinds. One of the most wonderful pageants ever photographed.
