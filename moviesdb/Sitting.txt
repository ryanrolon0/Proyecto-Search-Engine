Sitting

 What is at stake when one submits to the gaze of another? And, what is received from that offering? Using fluid visceral imagery and a spacious soundtrack, this short video illuminates the consciousness of both the act representation and the act of seeing oneself represented. Pivoting on the perceptual tension between experience and understanding, Pierce traverses the realm of the 'looker' and the 'looked at.'
