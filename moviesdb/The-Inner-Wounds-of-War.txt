The Inner Wounds of War

 While on patrol in Al Anbar, Iraq in 2005, an improvised explosive device blasted through Sergeant Juan Arredondo's vehicle resulting in the loss of his left hand and much of the calf muscles from both legs. Now, four years later, Ret. Sgt. Arredondo struggles to overcome not only his physical injuries but the impact of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Juan Arredondo is one of nearly 300,000 veterans of the United States' War on Terror suffering from invisible psychological wounds caused by the ubiquitous bomb blasts. Originally produced for Discovery's Military Channel website, 'The Inner Wounds of War' is an intimate portrayal of Ret. Sgt. Arredondo's journey to recovery, told through candid interviews and intimate photographs. Ret. Sgt. Arredondo shares his personal battles to overcome his physical and psychological injuries in this heartfelt story that is shared by the growing number of wounded veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
