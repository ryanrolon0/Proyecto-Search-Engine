The Mission to Heal

 The Mission to Heal sheds light into the personal and professional challenges of living and working in a Warrior Transition Unit (WTU). In this feature-length interactive movie, you make decisions as five different characters. Each character explores the challenges of being or caring for Wounded Warriors to understand and take ownership of his recovery, a military wife trying to understand what is wrong with her husband and how to successfully manage her husband's-and her own-mental health; a Social Worker experiencing compassion fatigue and now having the nightmares of his patients; a Nurse Case Manager experiencing difficulties with burn out; and a Squad Leader dealing with his biased decision making and adapting his warrior instincts to a health care mind-set.
