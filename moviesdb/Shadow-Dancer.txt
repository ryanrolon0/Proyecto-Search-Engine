But a new threat arouse, in a reptilian form that lived on vicious instinct alone. The colossal monster moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was relentless. The souls unfortunate enough to live became hostages, and mass panic swept the streets. It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His weapons were stealth and quickness of attack, his only allies when facing over overwhelming force. Relying on Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, assisted by his faithful dog. A young Ninja named Hayate battles together with his faithful pet dog, Yamato. At the center of the city, a terrorist group known as the 'Asian Dawn' is committing every imaginable atrocities known to man, including the planting of time bombs through-out the metropolis. Hayate and Yamato courageously set out to gather up all the explosive placed by the evil gang and annihilate the mastermind of the Asian Dawn.
