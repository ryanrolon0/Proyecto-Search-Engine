The Cheapest Man in the Room

 Ross Carter lives a normal life - for a guy on a budget. Some people call him thrifty, or economical, or even a money saver - Ross is all of those and more. He is surrounded by hilarious people, including his cheap old mentor Harold, his all-knowing roommate Dwayne, and the glamorous lady at the Country Time Senior Center - Geena. Life is good for Ross and his coupons, 2 for 1 sales, and free car washes, but that all changes when he meets the lovely Jenny Shree, an intelligent young woman and world traveler. Jenny is not impressed with Ross's cheap ways - which includes bringing a bag of old wine to a date - and she challenges Ross on his cheapness.
