Taksi

 Desi, a pretty young woman, leaves her baby in a taxi driven by Giyon. After going to the press to seek help in finding Desi, he takes the baby to his home. He soon becomes famous for his kind deed and later on discovers Desi, who has become a singer in the capital. Their happiness is, however, short-lived when the newspapers spread malicious rumors that the child is illegitimate and that Giyon is the father.
