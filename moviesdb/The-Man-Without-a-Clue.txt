The Man Without a Clue

 Dale, a chronic amnesiac who today believes himself to be film-noir detective Guy Wise, stumbles upon an intimate moment between his would-be lady Lexie (whom he believes to be named "Tuesday") and her REAL partner, Charles Withingworth III. Can Guy best Tuesday in a match of wits to win her over, or will his voiceover narration, only heard by Lexie, get the best of him?
