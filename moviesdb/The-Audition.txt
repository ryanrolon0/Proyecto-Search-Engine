The Audition

 Phil Emerton's Band plays for booker Mr. Rogers, who gives Phil some ideas for staging the numbers. Hannah Williams joins in with songs and ideas for a Southern levee sequence. After numbers by The Three X Sisters and the tap team of Larry & Larry, Mr. Rogers realizes he has mistaken Phil Emerton's Band for the Royal Acadians.
