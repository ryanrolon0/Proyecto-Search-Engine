To Be John Woo

 You ever wonder what it would be like to be someone else? Well for film geeks like Tyler Deacons, this is an everyday pondering. He has always craved adventures like those had by Hong Kong action heroes. Now with a twist of fate, he's getting his chance to live out his fantasies. One day, while working another humdrum shift at a video store, Tyler attempts to steal Woo's 1997 film, Face/Off. Unfortunately for him, the manager's son Greg just happens to see his actions. Greg tells Tyler that his only option if he wants to save his job is to go see the video store owner, Mr. Sezwick. He tells Tyler he has an assignment for him to carry out, and if he refuses he'll lose his video store job and more. This secret mission leads Tyler to discover adventure, danger, and what it's like To Be John Woo.
