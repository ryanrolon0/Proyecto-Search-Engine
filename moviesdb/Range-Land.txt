Range Land

 Sheldon has his gang robbing Allen of the gold bars from his stamp mill and then has them converted into nuggets at his worthless mine. Whip arrives at Sheldon's mine posing as an outlaw and learns of the scheme. But Doris unknowningly reveals Whips identity to Sheldon who then heads to the mine with his men to finish off Whip. On a stagecoach bound for Red Rock, Ben Allen, owner of a stamping mill, tells Whip Wilson, former U. S. Marshal turned rodeo performer, that in recent months bandits have stolen over $80,000 in gold bars being transported on stagecoaches. Doris Allen rides out from Red Rock to meet her father while Whip moves up to the boot with driver Joe Evans. Bary Sheldon, new owner of the Red Rock mine and unknown leader of the outlaws, has sent his henchmen Pete Cook and Spike Davis, to intercept the stagecoach and murder Allen. The presence of Doris and Whip forces the outlaws to change their plans but Whip has detected driver Evans, also a gang member, signaling the outlaws to lay off. In Red Rock, Whip and his partner, "Winks" Grayson start their investigation into the robberies and the earlier killing of U. S. Marshal Matt Mosley.
