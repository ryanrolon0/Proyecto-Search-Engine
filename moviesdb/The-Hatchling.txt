The Hatchling

 A story about being different. About loneliness. About birth and death... A mysterious girl in black retrieves a black box from an old church. She places the box in a concrete chamber and removes its content; an egg. From this egg a strange creature is born, a weak boy with chicken wings and an upper lip like a beak. Not knowing anything of this world he explores the boundaries of his birthplace and all that is in it. Is what he finds a coincidence, or is it part of a larger plan? Is what happens purely random, or a designed test?
