Spyro

 It's the Year of the Dragon! Every tweleve years, Dragon Kingdom has a festival where the fairies deliver a new batch of dragon eggs to the Dragon Worlds. But this year is a little different. Far away, on the opposite side of the world, an evil Sorceress plans on using the eggs for her evil magic. So all 150 eggs are stolen by her army of Rhynocs and her disciple, Bianca. It's up to Spyro, Sparx, and Hunter the Cheetah to get them back.
