Ranbhoomi

 Village born, simple-minded and honest, Bholanath comes to the big city with five hundred rupees, which he decides to keep with a prostitute, as he feels that his money will be a lot safer with her, than with him. He then befriends a dreaded gangster, Roopa, and goes to live and keep house for him. In an attempt to end hostilities between Roopa and rival gangster, Chandan Singh, he then offers himself as a hostage. But will the dreaded Roopa compromise to save Bholanath? And if so, will Chandan let Bhola live?
