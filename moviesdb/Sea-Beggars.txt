Sea Beggars

 The legend of Sea Beggars' Night, when no man can stay awake and no lock can be fastened against the briny ghosts, crowned in moss and barnacles, who rise from the sea and slosh manfully into darkened homes - where trembling wives await - and cuckold every man as he sleeps. One Sea Beggar falls in love with the Parson's wife, the town pervert, who drains every drop of life from the undead and love lorn spectre of the sea.
