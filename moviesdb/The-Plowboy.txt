The Plowboy

 Mickey goes about his farm chores, plowing with Horace and milking Clarabelle, while Minnie sings (until Mickey kisses her, when she stalks off). Clarabelle gets too friendly with Mickey, forcing him to wrap her tongue around her snout. A bee stings Horace and he gallops off uncontrollably, breaking Mickey's plow.
