Sottovoce

 Born in Roccascolagna, Abbruzzo, Claudio Pazienza points his camera at the people who still live in his native place. From 1986 to 1992, he interviews several of them and minutely observes the way they live. But the outlook is not only ethnographic, it is also fantastic, with the presence of a talking crow and the unexpected comeback of Baron Corvo de Corvis, an 18th century nobleman, who believes nothing has changed since he was alive. He is amazed to find out that the local maidens of this then remote and backward place now refuse the Droit du Seigneur.
