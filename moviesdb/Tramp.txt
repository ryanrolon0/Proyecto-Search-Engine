Tramp

 Dana Dewars (portrayed by Samantha Fox) is going through a nasty divorce from her husband. Her character and past are being questioned in order to deny her the lifestyle she claims to be hers. She tells her life story to her lawyer to convince him of her social standing, while the viewer watches it as it "really" was.
