Queerer Than Thou

 Queerer Than Thou is a comedic short that tackles the age-old question of 'Who is the queerest of them all?' With a cast representing many diverse aspects of the LGBT/Queer community, Queerer Than Thou explores the boundaries of identity, and the tensions that frequently exist along these borderlands. Through off-beat humor and a surreal dance-off finale, Queerer Than Thou pokes fun at LGBT/Queer communities from within. This unique and amusing critique of identity politics adds an important voice to the growing body of queer and trans cinema around the world.
