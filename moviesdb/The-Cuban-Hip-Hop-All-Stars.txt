The Cuban Hip Hop All-Stars

 In 1999, Papaya Records, recorded the Cuban Hip Hop All-stars, the islands first hip hop compilation. Two years later, filmmaker, joshua bee alafia, went down to Habana to do a follow-up documentary hip hop artists from the ground-breaking album and Habana's burgeoning hip hop scene. With interviews, freestyle ciphers, dramatic recreations and live footage of Ananimo Consejo, Instincto, Obsesion, Hermano's de Causa, Explosion Suprema, Papo Record, Pablo Herrera, Sexto Sentido, 100% Original, and others, this film captures some of the explosive vitality of a hip hop scene comparable to New York's in the late 80s.
