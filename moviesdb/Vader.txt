Vader

 Vader The Rise and Fall is a improvised mockumentary following Darth Vader's transition from Dark Lord of the Empire to being on unemployment benefit. Vadar struggles to deal with everyday life in the brewery town of Kimberley, Nottingham, missing the thrust and day to day action in the Death Star. Throughout the film we see how he became a Dark Lord, his bid to wipe out all Ewoks due his allergies and the allegations of Vadar's love child.
