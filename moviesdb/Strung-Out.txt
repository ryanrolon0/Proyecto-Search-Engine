Strung Out

 A filmic representation of an ethnographic study addressing heroin use and MMT (Methadone Maintenance Treatment) in Portlaoise, a small urban town in the midlands of Ireland. The film incorporates directly recorded picture from the field with the ethno-fictional recordings of two drug users who play the roles of the projects primary subjects by drawing of their own experience of drug use. The film is narratively structured to exhibit the contrastable and the significantly comparable pattern of heroin and methadone users lives by drawing attention to the sensorial elements of vision and sound they are both exposed to daily.
