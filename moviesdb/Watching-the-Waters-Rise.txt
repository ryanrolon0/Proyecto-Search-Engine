Watching the Waters Rise

 This is a documentary on the great flood of 1927 focusing upon its effects in Arkansas. The flood was a great tragedy, killing hundreds of people, damaging over two million acres of farmland, and costing the Federal Government over one million dollars in 1927 currency. But the flood was also a triumph. The people, even though this terrible misfortune had befallen them, got back up, and returned to their lives, setting an example for the entire nation. Only a few people are still alive who lived through the flood. This project will preserve their memories for future generations.
