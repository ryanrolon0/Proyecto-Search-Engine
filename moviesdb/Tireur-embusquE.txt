Tireur embusquE

 On a beautiful afternoon, a mysterious man in a cap and sunglasses arrives in a public park carrying a rifle case, enters a tower and makes his way up the winding staircase. When he reaches the top, he looks out of the window and sees people enjoying their day in the park. He opens the gun case and pulls out an item that gives entirely new meaning to the term 'instrument of destruction.'
