Under Montana Skies

 Cowhand Clay Conning rescues a theatrical troupe in the town of Red Rock by using the lead singer/dancer, Blondie, to threaten to compromise the hotel owner, Abner Jenkins. Clay pays their hotel bill but Martha Jenkins whose husband also owns the opera house objects to the showing going on. Clay, who has fallen in love with Mary, the troupe's leading lady, begins courting Mrs. Jenkins at a level she thinks is higher than he does. Frank Blake, a cattle rustler convicted by Clay, holds up the box office after the show begins.
