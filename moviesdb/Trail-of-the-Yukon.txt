Trail of the Yukon

 Matt Blaine and his son, Jim, and their men, rob John Dawson's bank, although Jim doesn't approve, even though Dawson jumped Matt's mining claim. Their accomplices double-cross them and the Blaines escape by canoe. They are followed and meet Royal Candian Mounted Policeman Bob McDonald, who helps them fight until all three men are wounded. Aided by Chinook, McDonald's dog, they escape but Matt dies. McDonald then sets out to prove that Dawson was the real culprit. When the local Banker jumps the Blaine's claim, they have men rob the bank to retrieve their money. When the men try to double-cross the Blains, a gunfight erupts and Jim Blaine gets away with the money. Mountie Bob McDonald gets Jim Blaine to return the money. Bob thinks the Banker was really behind the robbery and now uses the money to try and lure him into a trap.
