Student Short Film

 Movies are great... short films are different. Why are short films unpopular? Why does the picture look just a little off? Why are there proportionally fewer great short films? "Student Short Film" doesn't pretend to be anything else. Seven films explain these and other differences between movies and shorts. Including genres from comedy to action, there is something for everyone in this picture.
