Squirm

 At the beginning of the film, we learn from one of the characters that earthworms can be called to the surface with electricity, but somehow it turns them into vicious flesh-eaters. Sure enough, a storm that night causes some power lines to break and touch the ground, drawing millions of man-eating worms out of the earth, and into town where they quickly start munching on the locals. Slightly tongue-in-cheek horror film about carnivorous worms brought to the surface by a fallen electrical wire that sends millions of volts of electricity into the ground near the vicinity of a sleepy fishing village in the US state of Georgia.
