 As a young boy David witnessed a fatal car accident, causing the death of his younger brother. Since then he has sought comfort in a Chinese philosophy video called The Higher Force. To this day, the wisdom of the Higher Force is guiding David through life and despite him being a member of questionable gang of debt-collectors, David is certain that fate has something greater in store for him. Upon moving into a new building, David befriends the landlord, Harald, a lonely elementary school teacher, who senses the young man's insecurity and need for guidance. When Harald finds out that David is a member of a debt-collectors gang, Harald starts playing himself as a big crime lord, owning real estate all over town, employing dubious characters and receiving large shipments of illegal goods from abroad. David's low status amongst his debt-collector mates, who keep putting him down for being a coward, quickly changes once David starts feeding them information on Harald, the mysterious crime lord. He becomes the center of attention as he risks his life to spy on the 'dangerous' elementary school teacher and his big operations for the paranoid debt-collector gang. David is certain that fortune's turn of events is due to the influence of the Higher Force, enjoying every minute of the gang's new found respect for him. Little by little, cracks start to form in David's new existence. Harald's behavior becomes stranger by the day, causing trouble for David's spying game, as the pressure increases from the gang to take immediate action against Harald and his operations. The gutless David will need to take action against the innocent Harald or end up in a ditch himself.
