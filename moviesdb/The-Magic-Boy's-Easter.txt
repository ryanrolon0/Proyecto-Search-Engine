The Magic Boy's Easter

 12-year-old Josh has a crippling disease in his leg and is cynical about the abilities of his doctor to assist him. After a visit from a Magician, he has a vivid dream in which he discovers that he doesn't need to be alone and that miracles are real. His faith in Jesus Christ is renewed and Josh wakes up with confidence that a miracle can save his leg. A crippled boy in modern times has a dream in which he is a street child who teams up with a street magician at the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus. In one amusing scene they sneak in after The Last Supper and steal the leftovers. Later, seeing Jesus fall while carrying the cross, the boy hobbles out and gives Jesus water. Jesus heals the boy of his affliction. Later, when the boy wakes from his dream, although still crippled, he has learned to face his life with Faith and courage.
