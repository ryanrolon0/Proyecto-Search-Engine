Tooth Fairy, Where Are You?

 Dottie, a little fairy with glasses, red curls and a yellow raincoat is training to become a good tooth fairy, however, she's a bit clumsy and it's difficult for her. One night, it's her turn to make a visit to the house of a little girl named Lori, who had begun to doubt the existence of fairies. Dottie accidentally wakes up Lori as she is searching under her pillow, and even though Lori is very happy to see her, Dottie knows she's broken one of the most important rules of the tooth-fairies. Lori invites Dottie to stay in her home for a few days and offers her a comfortable bed inside her doll house. Lori too wears glasses and has freckles, the reason she is constantly teased by an older boy at her school, something that upsets her greatly. One day, Lori decides to take Dottie to school as her new doll and all the children are amazed with its extraordinary abilities. The day comes in which Dottie must say goodbye to her new friend and pass a test at her school for fairies; if she does pass, she will never again be able to see Lori.
