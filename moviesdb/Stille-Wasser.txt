Stille Wasser

 A shy young man is walking alone through the snow swept streets of the city. The saving paradise in this cold, snowy night are the lit up, warm windows of a video store.

Only in his dreams can he show of himself what he so sorely misses in reality. In his dreams he is there, cool and relaxed, singing a love song to her. But real life is very different...
