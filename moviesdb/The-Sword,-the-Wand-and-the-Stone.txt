The Sword, the Wand and the Stone

 On what seems like an ordinary day, three school children find themselves each with a task to accomplish. As they are transported into strange worlds they must face their own fears in order to complete their journey. A story of courage and the will to succeed where others have failed. A journey into the Heartland.
