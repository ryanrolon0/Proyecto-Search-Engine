Those Good Old Days

 Young Gloria's father and mother go out for the evening to see a television broadcast (yes, there was television in 1941!). Gloria's grandfather entertains her with stories about his days in vaudeville, and viewers see some of the musical numbers he performed with Gloria's grandmother those many years ago.
