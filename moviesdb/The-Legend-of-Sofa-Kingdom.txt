The Legend of Sofa Kingdom

 The Legend of Sofa Kingdom is all about this Philadelphia phenomenon Quizzo. Quizzo gives every Philadelphian an excuse to drink on a weeknight. Pub trivia exists in other American cities, but nowhere has it spawned such a diverse and thriving sub-culture as it has in Philly. Also, we kick butt at it. "The Legend of Sofa Kingdom" follows the 'winning-est' Quizzo team on their way to defend their Quizzo Bowl Title, while exploring the history of Quizzo and it's major players.
