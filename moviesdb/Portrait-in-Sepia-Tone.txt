Portrait in Sepia Tone

 Portrait in Sepia Tone tells the story behind a sepia tone photograph that two teenage sisters, Karen and Lisa, discover in an old trunk in 1965. As their grandmother Victoria weaves the tale of her sister's troubled marriage to prominent doctor Marshall Decker, we are transported back to old San Antonio, Texas. The film follows the characters' crises from 1913 to 1944.
