Sneak, Snoop and Snitch in Triple Trouble

 Sneak, Snoop and Snitch are in the Lilliput jail - not because they've done anything, but just because they might. A pardon appears under the door. Little Snitch is excited and tries to tell the two others, but they only pummel him as usual and tell him to keep quiet. Sneak, who has the sharp nose and raspy voice, suddenly comes up with the idea to tunnel out. He grabs the pardon from Snitch and draws a map on the back of it. With their plan on paper, the three of them proceed to dig their way out of jail. Unfortunately, they dig underneath the warden's garden. Childlike Snitch picks the flowers from below, alerting the warden to the fact that something is up - or rather, under.
