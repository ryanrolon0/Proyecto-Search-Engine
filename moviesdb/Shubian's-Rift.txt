Shubian's Rift

 The Earth exploratory space vessel Journeyman, led by Captain Shubian finds itself in first contact with two alien civilizations 100 light years away that are embroiled in an enormous civil conflict that is about to erupt into an all out war. However, through the use of an artificially generated wormhole that connects our solar system with theirs, the war has a strong possibility of being waged on our turf, bringing up more questions than answers to the entire mystery of the conflict.
