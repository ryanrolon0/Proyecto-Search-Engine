Reality to the Max

 A darkly-humored horror short about a deviant sociopathic couple who decide to exploits their talents and branch into capitalizing on the reality TV show craze. They decide to film an "educational/informational" pilot to pitch to networks execs about different ways that innocent, unsuspecting women are lured into traps. The production does not go well, especially for their unwillingly cast first victim.
