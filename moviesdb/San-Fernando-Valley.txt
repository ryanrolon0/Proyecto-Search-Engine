San Fernando Valley

 A ranch owner fires his ranch hands and brings in women to replace them. The owner's daughter wants the male hands back and comes up with a plan to do it. They will rustle the horses and when the women hands are unable to find them, they will bring them in and get their old jobs back. But the two hands that steal the horses sell them and then claim they were robbed.
