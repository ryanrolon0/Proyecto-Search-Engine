The Bedwetter

 The Bedwetter is a quirky & off-beat coming of age story set in 1975 and follows Shelly, an almost 11 year old Tomboy who wets the bed, gets bullied at school and whose Mother killed herself a year earlier and now has to deal with her new Stepmother, a glamorous former Stewardess, who wants to throw her a birthday party. To help Shelly along the way, she has her dapper and enthusiastic best friend Dean, and Martha, a local Homeless Woman who takes a special interest in her. Further complicating things is Shelly's slight preoccupation with Abby, the cool girl at school.
