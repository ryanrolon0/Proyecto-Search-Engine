The Nomad Experience

 THE NOMAD EXPERIENCE is an invitation to an extraordinary journey. A travel around a world of sensations that vibrate with the beats of the human condition and its contradictions. The documentary film stimulates reflection about love, loneliness, spirituality and human values. It is guided by reflections of great thinkers, writers and spiritual leaders of our time, like AndrE Comte-Sponville, the Dalai Lama, Krishnamurti or Sigmund Freud.
