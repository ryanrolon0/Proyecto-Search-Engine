Standing By

 A veteran TV commercial Director realizes he is about to lose his most important account but can't bring himself to ask for the help of his young studio manager whose unique point-of-view and creativity is the key to the older man's future. Marcus is repellent and a bully but amusing. Ron is the young guy starting up the ladder, dreaming of the top, but not sure how to reach the next rung. In both these men, and in the film crew regulars that surround them, we recognize universal themes of the need for respect, understanding and the struggle to succeed. Based on an award-winning Off-Broadway play, Standing By is a dark, workplace comedy.
