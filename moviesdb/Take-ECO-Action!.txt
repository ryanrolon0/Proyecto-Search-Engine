Take ECO-Action!

 ECO-Action and how others can contribute to cleanup efforts to help prevent unnecessary animal deaths and harm. Heros include ECO-Canoeist Founder Stephen Nordlinger, ECO-Action Executive Director Beth Hollenbeck, and Funding Charter Member Greg Dorf, as well as many of the ECO-Action volunteers. The story attempts to inform other people across the globe how to duplicate the river cleanup effort that ECO-Action has done for years and to increase the number of volunteers doing waterway cleanups.
