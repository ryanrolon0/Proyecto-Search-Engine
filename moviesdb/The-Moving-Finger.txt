The Moving Finger

 Her old friend Maude Calthrop, wife of the village vicar, summons Miss Marple when several of the local residents receive a poison pen letter. All of the recipients thus far are men and all are accused of some act of moral turpitude. When the local solicitor's wife, Angela Symington, is found dead with a poison pen letter at her side, the coroner rules that she took her own life. Not surprisingly, Jane Marple disagrees and is convinced it was murder. When a second villager is killed, it appears Miss Marple is correct. She also deduces the real purpose of the letters. Squadron Leader Gerry Burton is sent to a tranquil country village to recover from the effects of a plane crash and be nursed back to health by his beautiful sister Joanna. As they are new to the community, they are shocked to receive an anonymous, sexually explicit poison pen letter. They later find that other village gentry have been victimized by the same crank writer, and the vicar's wife sends for her friend Miss Marple in hopes of exposing the perpetrator. When a solicitor's wife apparently takes poison after receiving a particularly vicious message, Miss Marple suspects that the letters are a smokescreen for something more ominous. When a house maid is found bludgeoned to death, she knows she is right.
