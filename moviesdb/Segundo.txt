Segundo

 Benjamin Green stars as an artist who talks about how a big show of his art leads to him having to avoid everybody in his life. It was supposed to be his shot at glory, but he blows it by making an idiot of himself in front of friends and fellow artists. Now he has to live with the fallout. Segundo is the second of a trilogy of films - Monologue Triptych - about an artist bent on unburdening himself of the past, present and future.
