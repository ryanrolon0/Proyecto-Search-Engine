Ridin' on a Rainbow

 When the showboat hits town, two men use the parade as a distraction to rob the bank. Their accomplice is Pop, the clown from the showboat. He leaves the money on the boat and tells his daughter Patsy to bring it to him at a later stop on the river. When Patsy arrives without the money, both her and her father are made prisoners. So she sends her trained dog back to the showboat for help. Gene's investigation of a bank robbery takes him to a showboat. There he finds that teenage singer Patsy's father has been working with the robbers to provide for her future.
