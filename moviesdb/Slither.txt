Slither

 In this blend of the B movie classic _Blob, The (1958)_ (qv) and some Romero's zombies film, a meteorite collides in a small town. Grant finds it, and is infected by a parasite worm, which installs in his brain and causes him a creepy transformation into a monster. Starla, his wife, and Bill, a policeman, will try to stop him and the plague of worms generated by the creature. Near the deer hunting season in the small town of Wheelsy, a meteor falls on the woods with an egg of alien worm. Along the night, the local Starla Grant refuses to have sex with her husband Grant Grant and the upset man goes to a bar to have some drinks. He meets his acquaintance Brenda Gutierrez, the younger sister of his former girlfriend, who has a crush on him, and they go to the woods, but Grant does not have sex with her. He sees the weird egg on the grass, and when he touches it, the egg releases a sort of sparrow with an alien parasite that dominates Grant's brain. Along the next days, Grant has an insatiable hunger for meat, and while his hostage body is transforming, he builds a nest of slugs in his cellar. Grant infects Brenda and the slugs attack the human beings in Wheelsy, possessing their bodies. Starla, the local sheriff Bill Pardy and the survival Kylie Strutemyer try to find a way to stop Grant, the leader of a new breed of starving zombies. This blend of black humour and unnerving horror, with its nineteen fifties parodies pays homage to the great B-Movie Sci-Fi genre. Set in modern small town America, when an unsuspecting meteorite drops by and its tiny slug shaped parasitic pilot infects the local inhabitants, then all hell breaks lose, literally. Turning their infected hosts into Zombie type aliens, this is a battle of the fittest, this is the battle to save Mankind, this is pure B-Movie magic. Let the hunt begin.
