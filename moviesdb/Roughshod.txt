Roughshod

 Wrangler Clay Phillips and his young brother are taking horses to Sonora when they come across four dancehall girls heading the same way, stuck with a wrecked buggy. He takes the girls on to the nearest ranch, where it turns out one of the girls is the homesteader's wayward daughter. As he already has an escaped killer after him he is less than thrilled to have to take the remaining girls on with him. But it has to be said that Mary is damn easy on the eye. Mary Wells and her friends, Elaine, Helen and Marcia, are forced out of town by the reform element, and start for California. Along the way they meet Clay Phillips and his kid brother Steve, and Mary asks for their help. Clay grudgingly agrees to take them as far as the Wyatt ranch as he has troubles of his own. He and STeve are driving a herd of blooded horses to his California ranch, and trying to avoid an escaped convict, Ledvon, who has sworn to kill Clay on sight. Marcia's boy-fiend arrives and Marcia leaves with him to get married. At the Wyatt Ranch, Elaine finds and remains with her parents. Mary and Helen persuade Clay to take them to California and Mary, finding that Steve has never learned to read, teaches him along the way. The party reaches the camp of a young prospector, Fowler, and Helen decides to stay and marry him. Shortly afterward, Lednov and his two escaped-henchmen arrive and learn that Clay is just ahead of them. The trio brutally murders Fowler and Helen. Clay and MAry argue, and he flags down and takes the stagecoach to Sonora. Steve incurs Clay's anger and he announces he's going on by himself. Then the three outlaws ambush Clay.
