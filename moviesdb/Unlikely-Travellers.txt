Unlikely Travellers

This is their story fabulous adventurers, each with a unique and challenging intellectual disability. They have more baggage than the average tourist but no less passion for travel and achievement.

There's an autistic boy who has trouble with crowds and has to have the aisle seat, a former circus trainer who knows what to do if a camel gets lockjaw, and a thirty-something lady with schizophrenia who only hears friendly voices. There's a forty-year-old man with an unwavering passion for life, a decorated sportswoman with a loving fiancE and an introverted young woman who craves independence - and a good-looking man with money. From selection to preparation to the trip itself, they will each learn to face their insecurities, chase their dreams and explore their limitless possibilities. They will climb mountains and bridges, take terrifying leaps of faith, fall in and out of love, overcome exhaustion, fear and the hustle and bustle of big crowds, and show the world what they are capable of. They will learn to wheel and deal in the frantic Cairo markets, they will scuba dive in scary waters near Saudia Arabia, and they will ride camels and donkeys across some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth.
