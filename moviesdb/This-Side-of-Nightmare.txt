This Side of Nightmare

 Spring break. Middle of Nowhere, New Mexico. Piper and Ashley, a lesbian college couple, travel through a blazing heat wave - nervously heading home to meet the parents. After a run-in with road kill, their vacation is violently interrupted by a pair of bible thumping redneck sisters with a taste for G.T.A. and hate crime. Skull-shattering horror ensues as the rednecks are revealed to be unstoppable. Piper and Ashley's wits and survival skills are the only things keeping them alive as the nails approach their own coffins with blinding speed.
