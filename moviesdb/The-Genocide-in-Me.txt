The Genocide in Me

 From the 1915 Armenian genocide to contemporary North America, via modern Turkey. "The Genocide in Me" is a moving personal journey in which Canadian-Armenian filmmaker Artinian confronts the reality of her life in the Canadian melting pot of cultures. She asks herself the universal question "Where do I belong?".
