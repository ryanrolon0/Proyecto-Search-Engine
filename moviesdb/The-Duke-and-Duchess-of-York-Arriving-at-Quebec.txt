The Duke and Duchess of York Arriving at Quebec

 The wharf at Quebec is here shown with a regiment of Canadian Infantry drawn up in line. The Duke and Duchess of York walk straight toward our camera accompanied by a corps of Military Officers and Canadian notables. The picture ends by showing the Duke and Duchess leaving the warf in their carriage.
