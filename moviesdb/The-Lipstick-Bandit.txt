The Lipstick Bandit

 A burglar not only breaks into houses and steals the owners goodies, but leaves the lovely ladies bound and gagged. Her trademark is to draw a smile on the victims' tape-gags with lipstick. A beautiful detective is soon on the trail of the thief and a stealthy game of cat-and-mouse ensues.
