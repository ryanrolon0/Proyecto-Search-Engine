Six Gun Gospel

 Shipments of gold from Goldville are being hijacked by a gang secretly headed by Ace Benton, the town's leading citizen. Benton is also trying to acquire all the town property, as he knows the railroad is planning a line through there. U.S. Marshals Nevada Jack McKenzie and Sandy Hopkins are sent in, with Sandy posing as a preacher. Mine owner Bill Simms is almost wiped out by previous holdups and Dan Baxter, in love with Simms' daughter Jane, offers to drive the next stage shipment and Sandy is to ride shotgun. Benton's gang, headed by Durkin intends to rob the stage.
