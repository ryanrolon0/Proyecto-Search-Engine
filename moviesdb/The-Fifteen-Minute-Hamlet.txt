The Fifteen Minute Hamlet

 A tongue-in-cheek take on the film industry as if it existed in Elizabethan times. Director William Shakespeare shoots "Hamlet" in one reel, seemingly in one continuous take. When he screens this silly but accurate 15-minute version to a studio boss, he's told he needs to trim it down to make it more commercial. He begrudgingly does so, with surprising results...from the audience and himself.
