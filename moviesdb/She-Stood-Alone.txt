She Stood Alone

 This film tells the story of Lt. Paula Coughlin when she was assigned as an Admiral's assistant at the annual US Navy convention called Tailhook. During that convention, which often had predominately male officers partying wildly, she was subjected to "The Guantlet" in which she was sexually man-handled and harassed relentlessly by the male officers attending. Abused and humiliated by this collective affront to her, she sought to bring charges on her attackers. However, she found that she must not only confront her attackers, but more importantly, the male military mentality and profound sexism that permitted this kind of outrage in the first place.
