Speakeasy

 George just wrote the most successful jingle of his short-lived career. As a reward his boss takes him out on the town to his favorite speakeasy. During a case of purposeful mistaken identity, Mae, a young jazz singer, uses George to thwart the sexual advances of an aging silent film star, Archibald Patterson.
