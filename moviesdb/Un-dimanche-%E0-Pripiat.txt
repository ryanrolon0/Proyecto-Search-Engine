Un dimanche à Pripiat

 Somewhere in Europe there is a forbidden zone. Lying in the heart of this zone is Pripyat, at one time a model city inhabited by some 50 000 people. An invisible enemy forced the residents to evacuate the area in order to escape. Constructed in the early 1970s, Pripyat is now a ghost town. The land it was constructed upon has reverted back to its natural state, but traces of its former occupants are still visible some twenty years after.
