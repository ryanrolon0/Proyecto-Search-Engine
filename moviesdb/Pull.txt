Pull

 Over one summer day in Dublin, a girl reconnects with old friends, makes new ones and reaches a painful turning point in her most intimate relationship. PULL is a film about the flickering details of human connection --- the gestures, glances, games and misunderstandings that make up our daily relationships. It's a film about what draws us closer to people and what makes us want to push them away.
