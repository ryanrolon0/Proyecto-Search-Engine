The Chronicles of Hernia

 The epic vision of the backsliding, eccentric Director clashes with the reality of his micro-budgeted film. Determined to achieve his goal of getting a 10-picture deal with the studio, the Director uses all of his power to deliver his epic by begging, borrowing and stealing scraps and odds and ends. He even uses his dog as a substitute for the film's Lion. Reporter Hal Tosis is sent to stir up trouble by the evil genius, Mogulschwartz, who wants no competition from the competing, upstart studio. Hal's behind-the-scenes documentary follows the troubled and difficult Hernians as they become a party to the sabotage. Can the Hernians band together and save the picture? Let's hope so.
