Trailing Trouble

 Maynard is an easy going cowhand mistaken for a ruthless killer. Using this reputation, he is hired as a ranch foreman where he settles a major dispute over open rangeland and water rights. When mild mannered Friendly Fields is sent to the Blair ranch to work, he is mistaken for the notorious outlaw Blackie Burke. When a drought develops and the ranchers look for new grazing land, he plays the part and forces them to give he best plot to his boss Miss Blair. But no sooner than his mother arrives to expose the hoax, the real Blackie also arrives. "Friendly' Fielding ('Ken Maynard' (qv)), a happy-go-lucky cowboy rides into a stagecoach hold-up, and is caught unawares by "Blackie" Burke ('Eddie Parker (I)' (qv)), the bandit, and because he has no valuables, the robber takes his new hat. Fields turns the tables, recovers all the loot from the hold-up, except his precious hat which Burke escapes with, but leaves his own behind. He meets the foreman of the Bar-X, owned by Patience Blair ('Lona Andre' (qv)), and gets a job on the ranch. He is sent to collect the money for the Bar X cattle that have strayed to the Crocker ranch. Tom Crocker ('Roger Williams (I)' (qv)), because Fields is wearing Burke's hat, mistakes him for Burke and pays him for the strays, and then sends his henchmen after Fields to kill him and get the money back. Friendly eludes them and takes the money back to Miss Blair. Mrs. Dunn (Marin Sais' (qv)), the housekeeper, believes him to be Burke, and rides to town to inform the sheriff. The sheriff, Jake Jones ('Fred Burns (I)' (qv)) and local cattlemen are about to string Fields up when the real "Blackie" Burke rides onto the scene, and Fields rides after him in pursuit of his hat.
