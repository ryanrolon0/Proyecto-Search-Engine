The Toilet Guy

 The Toilet Guy spends his day looking after a public toilet. He has a seemingly unending list of chores, whether it's polishing the grille of the air vent, checking the air pressure of a drain, or comprehensively filing every nut and bolt he finds. Unable to find the solace he desires outside the toilets, and with no-one paying him any attention in his own domain, he immerses himself in his work. There is always more cleaning to be done.
