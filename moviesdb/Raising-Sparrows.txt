Raising Sparrows

 The film shows the sacrifice of a man who is following his dream. Randy is fulfilling his life-long dream of sailing around the world on his rural Midwestern farm by building a 45-foot schooner from scratch in his barn. The lumber is milled and cut from trees off of his own land and the keel is weighed down with parts from his old cars. The documentary follows him and his family as he builds his sailboat, moves it to Lake Superior, launches it and heads East towards the St. Lawrence River. Meanwhile, his faithful wife of more than 30 years stands by and watches him with admiration and hesitance because she is afraid to swim and hates the water.
