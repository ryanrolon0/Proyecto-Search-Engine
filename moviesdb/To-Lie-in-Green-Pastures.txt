To Lie in Green Pastures

 In this sentimental take on the classic 'road movie', Peggy Graves (Shirley Knight) gets in her car and drives. Two realities diverge as Peggy drives farther from home presenting a story that's beautiful and tragic, hopeful and doomed. Based on the true events of the remarkable and surreal death of a woman with Alzheimer's disease.
