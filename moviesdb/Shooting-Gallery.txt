Shooting Gallery

 A short, intimate film following the aspirations of two unfortunate friends, who after a lifetime of waiting for their opportunity to find the American Dream, decide to take control of their future. Deeply influenced by legends of Rock 'n' Roll achieving immortality by death, they believe the premature demise of an upcoming modernist painter will help them on their road to glory.
