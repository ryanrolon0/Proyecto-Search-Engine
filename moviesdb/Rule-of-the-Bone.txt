Rule of the Bone

 Chappie flees his troubled life in upstate New York, reinvents himself by taking the name Bone, and takes off an adventure that finds him aligned with a group of bikers, the savoir of a young girl named Rose and, ultimately, in cahoots with I-Man, a Rastafarian who takes him into the ganja-fied mountains of Jamaica.
