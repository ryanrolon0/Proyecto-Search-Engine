Tip Jar

 Surviving on tips is a tough way for a waitress to make a living. To make matters worse, they have to deal with customers asking them out all the time, misreading their flirtatious customer service for something else. Two waitresses decide to counter their customers' advances with elaborate excuses that not only let the guys down easy, but encourage them to leave a bigger tip! All goes well until one customer won't take 'no' for an answer. Now both waitresses must team up to show him their only interests lie with the tip!
