Three Graces

 Bianca, a school student, strikes up a bond with an elderly woman, Masuyo, her Japanese tutor. Wendy, Bianca's neglectful mother, is unaware of the close relationship that grows between Bianca and Masuyo.  Wendy is outraged when her daughter spends the night at the tutor's house. She cancels Bianca's lessons, but the friendship between the child and the older woman survives.
