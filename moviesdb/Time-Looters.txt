Time Looters

 Mad inventor, Rupert Tofton has built a time machine and intends to use it to find the hidden treasure of Big Beard the pirate. His plan involves stealing Big Beards treasure map from under his nose and hoping he doesn't notice. Maybe disguising the time machine as a Wendy house wasn't such a good idea after all.
