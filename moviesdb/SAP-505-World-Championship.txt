SAP 505 World Championship

 The 2009 SAP World Championship on San Francisco Bay had a little bit of weather for everyone's taste from 30+ knots of breeze and cool temperatures the first day, to hot and zephers later in the week. There's a lot of new emerging talent in the class. A number of younger sailors, with relatively little 505 experience are knocking on the door of the top 10. There's still one day left, but the competition is for the trophy is down to two, the same two that fought it out last week in the StFYC 505 North Americans -- Mike Holt/Carl Smit & Mike Martin/Jeff Nelson.
