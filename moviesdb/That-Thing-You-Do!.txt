That Thing You Do!

 Recounts a fable of a pop rock band formed a year after the Beatles took America by storm in early 1964. Jazz aficionado Guy Patterson, unhappily toiling in the family appliance store, is recruited into the band the Oneders (later renamed the Wonders) after regular drummer Chad breaks his arm. After Guy injects a four/four rock beat into lead singer Jimmy's ballad, the song's undeniable pop power flings the Wonders into a brief whirlwind of success, telling the tale of many American bands who attempted to grab the brass ring of rock and roll in the wake of the British Invasion. Tells the unlikely tale of a fictitious Erie, Pennsylvania band called The Wonders. With the help of a catchy single, these likeable teenagers go from garage band to nationwide sensation within a matter of months. But when they reach the top, how long will they be able to stay there?
