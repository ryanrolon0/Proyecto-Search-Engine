Walkabout

 Seven high school graduates set out into the Southern California wilderness on a church sponsored survival program, designed to instill "character, self-confidence and religious conviction." A series of hilarious disasters leaves them without food, shelter and adult supervision. Their aimless wandering is captured on film by an equally clueless, wannabe "edgy" documentary film crew.
