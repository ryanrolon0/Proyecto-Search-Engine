Reina santa

 A virtuous Spanish princess becomes Queen of Portugal, then troubled by social struggles and court intrigue. She negotiates a truce between the king's and his son's factions; and performs a miracle, by changing bread into roses, to appease the king's ire, has he had forbidden her to distribute bread to the poor peasants. After her husband's death, she entered a convent, resting her crown at the tomb of San Tiago, in Compostela.
