The Egyptian Mummy

 Professor Howe doesn't approve of his daughter's boyfriend. When the crated mummy of Rameses III arrives, the boyfriend disguises himself as the mummy and hides in the crate. When Professor Howe opens the crate, the 'mummy' speaks to him, declaring, "Let you daughter marry whom she will."
