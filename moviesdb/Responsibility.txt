Responsibility

 The election for student council president comes down to a dead heat. On the one hand is Lloyd, a conscientous, respnsible teen. On the other hand is Hank, a sneering, greasy-haired, irresponsible lout. The school's principal asks the audience, as he holds the tie-breaking vote in his hand, which candidate they would vote for, while reminding them that the best candidate is one who is "capable, educated and responsible" (and who, of course, doesn't look like a motorcycle-riding, quite possibly devil-worshipping parent's worst nightmare).
