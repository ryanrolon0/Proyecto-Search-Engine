River Story

 A group of three 12-year-old boys is trying to start a band, but they cannot get anywhere until they meet a suicidal man with just about the same problem. The boys help the man get over his depression and also manage to get their act together. The 'Riverman' thinks about killing himself once again, but the boys manage to talk him out of it.
