Prairie Justice

 Investigating the rising tide of banditry and rustling in Medicine Hat, U.S. Marshal Bob Randall ('Bob Baker (I)' (qv)) arrives under an assumed name. He meets Anita Benson ('Dorothy Fay' (qv)) who tells him she has come west to save her ranch but her uncle, John Benson ('Jack Rockwell (I)' (qv)), tells her all of her cattle have been stolen. When his father, Sheriff Pope Randall ('Forrest Taylor (I)' (qv)) is killed, Bob sets out to avenge his murder and to help Anita save her ranch.
