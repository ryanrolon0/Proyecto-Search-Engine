The Morning Show with Sara Succubus

 When Billy-Boy Fricasee, executive producer of XYZ News' The Morning Show, replaces long-time weatherman Millard Willmore with a beautiful and seemingly naive Marilyn Airhair, his star anchor, Sara Succubus, sets out to sabotage Marilyn's future in the industry. When there's a prison riot in the Bronx, Sara, in an effort to discredit Marilyn, sends her to cover the riot, not knowing that former President Bill Clinton is among the hostages taken, thus sending Marilyn to cover what turns out to be the story of the year. After Marilyn is taken hostage, Hillary Clinton begs her friend Sara to rescue her husband before he causes another sex scandal with Marilyn and ruins Hillary's bid for the presidency.
