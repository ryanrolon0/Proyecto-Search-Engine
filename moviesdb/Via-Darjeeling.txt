Via Darjeeling

 Ankur and Rimli, a couple honeymooning in Kalimpong are about to return to Calcutta. The day they are to take the train back, the husband goes missing from the hotel room. The Police inspector comes to investigate and discovers that Rimli complains of a mysterious man stalking her for some time. Rimli saw this man many times during their stay but her husband could never see him. The case is closed after some time and the Police inspector is transferred to Calcutta. After some years, in a rainy night in the city, friends sit together in a journalist's apartment. The Police inspector tells them the strange case of the missing husband and characters, personalities, motifs and professions change with perspectives. The past and the future come rushing back. The characters in the room blend in to the 'story'... Wealthy Indrajit Gupta arranges his daughter, Rimli's, marriage with his employee, a Sales Executive, Ankur Sharma, who has been in his employ for four years. The duo get married and honeymoon in Kalimpong, Darjeeling. On the 10th day, just before returning home to Kolkata, Rimli reports her husband missing. Inspector Robin Dutt investigates, and is told that an unknown male has been stalking Rimli. Earlier during the day Ankur had an altercation with Mohinder Rai, a private taxi-driver. Unable to locate Ankur's whereabouts nor his body, the incident is closed, and subsequently Robin gets transferred to Kolkata. When he attempts to discuss this case, he is admonished by the Police Commissioner, and even Indrajit does not show any interest. Then on a rainy night, Robin discusses this mystery with four friends in their apartment - and each one comes up with a different conclusion as to what possibly could have happened to Ankur.
