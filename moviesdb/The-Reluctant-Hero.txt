The Reluctant Hero

 Some three years after an "incident" in Afganistan, Corporal Apiata is informed by his commanding Officer that he is to be awarded the most prestigious military honor of them all - the Victoria Cross.For Willie, used to the deeply covert life of an SAS soldier, it is the start of a roller coaster ride into the forefront of the public eye. In Reluctant hero, we journey with Willie as he copes with the pressure of being a recognisable public figure, a proud role model for Maori, and hero to the nation.We follow Willie from the moment that he learns of the award and go behind the scenes with his family; at the NZSAS; the Victoria Cross investiture at Government House; back to his hometown marae and we relive the "incident" which earned him the coveted Victoria Cross.
