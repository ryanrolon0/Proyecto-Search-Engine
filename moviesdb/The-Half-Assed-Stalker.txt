The Half-Assed Stalker

 Will has lost the last thing he had of Saleen, a photo. Now he begins the arduous journey of trying to win her over. Unfortunately, she won't return his calls, so Will has decided to do the next best thing- stalk her. But stalking isn't quite like the movies, the time and effort and focus demanded can be overwhelming, or at least demanding. Can love overcome incompetence?
