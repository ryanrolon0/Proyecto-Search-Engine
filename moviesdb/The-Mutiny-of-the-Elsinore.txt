The Mutiny of the Elsinore

 The story of a surly crew, an honest God-fearing captain, a hardboiled-but-loyal Scotch mate, a scoundrelly second-mate, and then a mutiny, the fight and the final voyage to a safe harbor. But not before the Captain has been murdered, his pretty daughter in peril, her rescue by the single passenger on board, and a member of the crew thrown overboard by another crew member.
