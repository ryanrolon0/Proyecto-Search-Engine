Rosa e Benjamin

 The city outside and the city within. Inside old. Outside troubling new neighbor, gossip. Things that never change amid things that change too fast. The fragmented everyday, seen through a lens that's indirect and selective. Rosa and Benjamin tells as much as what comes inside a confining frame - what we put off-limits exposes what we take for granted.
