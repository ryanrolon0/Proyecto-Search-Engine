The Unsuspecting Neighbor

 Angella has lusted for Cassandra, her beautiful neighbor, for months, but she can't decide how to approach the buxom blonde with her desires. One day, when Angella sees Cassandra working in her yard, she gives up on subtlety and grabs, strips, ties and gags her neighbor, hoping that nude bondage will serve as an icebreaker. Cassandra is furious, and after much struggling manages to escape and proves that revenge is a meal best served hot.
