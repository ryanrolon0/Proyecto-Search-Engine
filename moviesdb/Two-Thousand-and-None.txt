Two Thousand and None

 A man finds himself developing a new perspective on life once he finds out it's almost over. Benjamin Kasparian is a paleontologist of Armenian descent who has just split up with his wife Amanda. While trying to readjust to single life, Benjamin visits the doctor and is informed he's suffering from an unusual brain disease called Talbot's Syndrome, and he's not likely to live longer than five weeks. Benjamin is initially philosophical about his fate and decides to enjoy himself as much as he can in the time he has left - much to the disgust of Amanda, his best friend, his boss, and his new girlfriend, all of whom believe he should be taking the matter more seriously.
