Rain 1949

 At first glance, the settlers of Kibbutz Megido and the Arab villagers of Lajun appear like two entirely different groups separated one from the other like east from west. But both of them are connected to the same hill. Director Ilan Yagoda arrived at Megido in 1977 as a part of his military service. Only then, did he discover that his mother had been a part of the original group of refugees who established Kibbutz Megido. For four years Yagoda lived on the Kibbutz. Then one day, he left never really saying goodbye. Seventeen years later he returns to the Kibbutz and meets the refugees of the past, Jews and Arabs tied to the same plot of land. Only the harsh rain, which continues to fall, is a reminder of the rain of the past.
