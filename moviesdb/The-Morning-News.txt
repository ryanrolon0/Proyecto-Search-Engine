The Morning News

 In old age your world shrinks and the outside world becomes no more than background noise. 'The News' is no longer your news, you are hidden, forgotten. Your understanding of your partner deepens to the point that things need no longer be spoken. You can finish each others' sentences and anticipate what the other will think or do. This morning Betty, Jim's wife, must rely on him knowing what she wants. Can a mere 'man' do the right thing? He tries his best, and through his actions he spells out for us a love which should be spoken. This is "The Morning News".
