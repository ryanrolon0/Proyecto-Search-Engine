Rootless

 From the lands of the Inuit to Tierra de Fuego the Huichol belief has never changed. The spirit of the departed will not die, but will keep on living in the other beings, where they will take refuge, and which they will inhabit. If the spirit is absorbed by a root, the spirit will travel along its veins, will become its trunk, and on its leaves, it will be moved by the wind.
