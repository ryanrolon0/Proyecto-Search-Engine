Quick Pick

 Eddie, a lovable loser who's strapped for cash and on the verge of getting evicted from his apartment, thinks he's lost the 135 million dollar winning lottery ticket and enlists the help of his two best friends to help him search for it all over Miami. Unbeknownst to his friends, Eddie has bet money that he doesn't have on the Yankees beating the Marlins in the 2003 World Series, a bet that he must win in order to get the thugs collecting money for his bookie off his back. Will Eddie win the bet? Will he find the ticket? Will greed ruin the friendship with his childhood buddies? Will he get the girl?
