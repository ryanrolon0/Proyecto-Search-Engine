Sanchez

 Sonny Sanchez is a seedy man out for one thing and one thing only, Cocaine. When Diego de Grassa finds out that Sonny is trying to buy the worlds supply of Cocaine he sends for Sanchez's nose. But what he doesn't know is Sanchez wants it for his own personal use. Sanchez is a thinking man's film that asks; Who do you trust? What addiction are you a slave to? And how far are you willing to go to save yourself.
