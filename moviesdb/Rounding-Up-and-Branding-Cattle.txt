Rounding Up and Branding Cattle

 Shows the principal work of Western cowboys. At every round-up, the country for miles around is searched and all the youngsters are driven to the enclosures to be branded. The cowboys gallop their ponies back and forth along the sides of the herd and the steers are quickly roped and branded.
