Shooting

 'Shooting' may seem like a the typical story of a killer who, after an exciting chase trough the streets of Milan on a hot summer day, catches up with his victim and kills her. But Gianluca is not a killer. He is a professional photographer hired that same day by Manfredi, an important businessman, to follow his beautiful wife Yvonne and take a compromising photo of her and her young lover. He completes the job right away and that very evening Gianluca hands over the photos of the affair. Manfredi reacts violently; he is harmed, and leaves the photographer's house with the worst intentions. This is just the beginning for the three protagonists of a dark story of passion with no easy way out.
