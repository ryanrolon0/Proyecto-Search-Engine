Sattusid hoogu, Hugo?

 "Lost the limit, Hugo?" is a road-drama about violence, possibilities of escaping from it and becoming a man. Two brothers, brought up by their father's macho-like tyranny, decide to escape from home to become free. On the road they face several situations that demand from them standing on the defense of themselves and each other. A ride to freedom introduces them to their real nature.
