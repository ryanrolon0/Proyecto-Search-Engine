 When the boss of a highly profitable Triad family is forced to flee from Hong Kong, rival gangs swoop in to steal any piece of the action they can. York Koo (Andy Lau) becomes the family's acting boss, and must do what he can to handle the difficult situation, with mounting pressure from both the Hong Kong police, and rival families.
