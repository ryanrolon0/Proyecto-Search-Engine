Un coeur en hiver

 Beautiful violin virtuoso Camille has two obsessions and a friend of her husband's who crafts violins. But his heart seems to be as cold as her playing is passionate. Stephane and Maxime run a well-respected violin making and repair business. When man-about-town Maxime falls in love with violin virtuoso Camille, Stephane - whose only attachment is a platonic one with a bookshop owner - takes his own interest in this new girl in Maxime's life and in her music-making. Camille gradually becomes attracted to him, but finds his cold lack of response by turns puzzling and irritating. Bit by bit the odd mEnage-à-trois becomes set on a collision course.
