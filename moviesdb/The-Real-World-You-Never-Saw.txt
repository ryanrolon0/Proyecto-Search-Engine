The Real World You Never Saw

 When the Real World blows into The Windy City, hold on tight because things get a little crazy. And one Chicago season just isn't big enough to show all the hook-ups, revolving-door dates, crew mishaps, group-sized (and group used) showers, and Cara's forbidden lust for a director that eventually everyone knew about. It's the first Real World to tape during the hot summer months, so watch Tonya, Cara, Chris, Theo, Kyle, Keri and Aneesa turn up the heat (and strip off the clothes - did we mention the showers?) in the wackiest, sexiest and funniest outtakes and bloopers ever on The Real World You Never Saw - Chicago!
