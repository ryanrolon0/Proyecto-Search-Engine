The Johnna Man

 The Johnna Man is a story of love, loss, grief, friendship and unnecessary cruelty to goldfish, as told by Chris Riseborough - a late twenty-something comedy writer who spends his days adrift in a sea of self involvement and whiskey. On the day that Chris' estranged wife, Tilly, informs him of her intention to file for a divorce, Chris doesn't think that the day could get any worse. That is until he learns that his closest childhood friend, John Naylor (AKA The Johnna Man) has become very estranged indeed. Terminally So. When Chris returns to his hometown of Brighton in order to pay his last respects he is once again brought face to face with the friends that he left behind. Amongst them are Pete and Ian, a drink & drug orientated Laurel & Hardy, Nessa, a dizzy but loveable psuedo hippy, Steph, the late Johnna's oft-overlooked girlfriend, and Ryan, a misanthropic, New York dwelling architect who "makes Edmund Blackadder look like Mary Poppins". Also present in this group of old friends is the other object of Chris' misery - Tilly. Over the next three days, there will be laughter, tears, and lavatory-dwelling goldfish as the gang come to celebrate the passing of one of their closest friends... The Johnna Man.
