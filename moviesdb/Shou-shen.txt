Shou shen

 Sergeant Tak (Anthony Wong) must track down a serial killer whose victims are starved, mutilated, and killed, and weighing exactly 70 pounds. The victims have an unexplainable link to a TV show which runs a beauty contest called "Slim Queen", where they appear as contestants. The plot thickens as Sergeant Tak and his wife, Ling, an ex-detective herself, race to find the murderer before more contestants end up dead.
