A satire of violence, paranoia, and of course, toasters. A murderer known only as 'The Toaster' escapes from prison, causing a flurry of panicked reactions throughout Brooklyn. The murderer goes on the lam, hiding out at a street sale, before being purchased by Thora Deetz, a cranky Goth girl with a love of absinthe...and little else. She is completely ignorant of the evil nature of the appliance she has purchased...but as strange things start to happen around her apartment, how long will that last? Meanwhile, Lucy and Ricky Blank appear on the surface to be the perfect couple, but Lucy's increasing paranoia over appliances after the Toaster's escape is starting to cause strain on their relationship. Daily Local newscaster Minne Haberdash provides commentary on the entire media circus, inciting detectives McKettle and Swiff to come out of hiding and pursue the Toaster until he finally receives justice at the hands...er, handles..of those who put him behind bars in the first place. A satirical ensemble thriller with plenty of laughs, gasps, and, of course, toasters.
