The Splendour of the Heavens

 Imagine what it would be like to watch a film that has just been washed up to the shore. The Splendour Of The Heavens is an exploration of an exotic somewhat familiar, yet not explained place in Space and Time. The camera follows an asteroid that enters the atmosphere of an abandoned planet and unleashes a mysterious energy. This energy is not one of Life but of History and Memory, functioning as a metaphor for the 'end of progress' as understood by the Western Society.
