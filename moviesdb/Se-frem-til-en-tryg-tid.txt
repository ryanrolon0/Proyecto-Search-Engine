 A study of the basic elements of film, first and foremost framing and the relationship between image and sound. The film consists of shots of a Spanish barber at work, a man telling stories, and the musician Louis Hjulmand playing the vibraphone. Look Forward to a Time of Security is a study of the basic elements of film, first and foremost framing and the relationship between image and sound. The film consists of shots of a Spanish barber at work, a man telling stories, and the musician Louis Hjulmand playing the vibraphone. Correspondingly we hear the sounds of shaving, the silly stories and Hjulmand's music, but on the soundtrack the music is from a piano and not a vibraphone, and sound and picture are never in synch. The elements are combined at random, giving us a powerful indication of the artifice of film, and there are brief, comical clashes, such as when a visual of shaving foam is countered with words like cement mixer and whipped cream on the soundtrack. Unusual image compositions are toyed with and the framing is absolute, with the barber's movements often transgressing the frame of the shot, for example. The film ends without pictures as the soundtrack seems to be torn past the tape head. The title is a social democratic party slogan.
