The Bon Bon Parade

 A boy, attracted by the same confectionery display that attracts a fly, goes inside and starts eating. A cherub, threatened by him, offers a wish, and the kid asks to live in candyland full time. A train takes him there, where a cupcake king greets him and we see a lavish parade of various goodies, including another group of three cherubs that parody the Three Stooges.
