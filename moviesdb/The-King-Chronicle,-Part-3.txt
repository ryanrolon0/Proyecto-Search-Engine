The King Chronicle, Part 3

 This final episode of the life of Canadian Prime Minister W.L. Mackenzie King begins with the divisive Conscription Crisis. Despite his assurances that conscription would not be implemented, conditions in Europe force King to hold a plebiscite on the issue. King remains in office until his retirement in 1948. A lonely man, he lives out his remaining years at Kingsmere.
