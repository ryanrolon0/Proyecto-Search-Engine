Rubber Gloves

 In her spanking-clean, detached house on a quiet street, Jill-Anne seems like a typical suburban housewife, with too much to do and too little time school sports-team uniforms are drying on the line outside and need ironing, her mum phones to chat, Jill-Anne's got to bake a cake, and there are groceries to put away. The doorbell rings without an appointment, but he has a spare half hour and requests time with "Sandra." Who is this "Sandra," and what does she have to do with Jill-Anne, the telephone, the iron, the cake, an armoire, the uniforms, and rubber gloves?
