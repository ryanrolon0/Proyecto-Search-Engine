The Gallery

 With a pocketful of stolen cash from his father, 16-year-old Alex escapes to Los Angeles in a taxicab to search for his old childhood crush, and to break free from the monotony of his daily life. He lives out of a luxury suite and spends his nights dining in restaurants and visiting art galleries as he searches for her. He quickly begins to drain his supply of cash however, and he grows desperate as his dreams decay.
