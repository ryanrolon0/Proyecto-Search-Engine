Shades of Grey

 Shades of Grey is a documentary on the shades of Grey in human life, on heroism and powerlessness, moreover on what happens when the question of guilt is not easily answered. The film tells the story of Mies Braal (90), great aunt of director Saskia van den Heuvel who lives in Canada. After her husband Frans passes away, Mies is finally able to lead her own life. This World War II heroin tries to take responsibility for the awful things that happened in her family. For this she might need more courage that she needed as a young mother in WWII when she hid 26 people in her home, amongst whom a Jewish boy and a Canadian pilot.
