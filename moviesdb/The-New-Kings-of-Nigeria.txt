The New Kings of Nigeria

 Jaja of Opobo was a nineteenth century slave who rose up to become a legendary King, before being kidnapped by the British. 140 years later Jaja's great-grandson, and heir to the throne, returns to Lagos - and becomes the voice of Big Brother Nigeria. The burgeoning media world is Walter's new playground, and he joins a colourful cast of characters in an energetic romp through its screens, sets, and socials. But Walter increasingly identifies with the spirit of the swelling numbers of Nigerians he sees hustling on the street outside his window. Back on the set of The Apprentice Africa, Walter is faced with a dilemma values of ruthless materialism really what he, or his country, wants to embrace? Walter's idea of 'King' and 'country' are changing by the day. When he lands a job on 'Football talent hunt', Walter encounters a spirited young boy in the slums. Giving this young boy the opportunity he so craves - to have a chance in life - makes Walter feel 'kingly' in the most unexpected of ways. Walter comes to the realisation that "being a King is not something you are born into. It is something you do, make happen". In that moment, Walter discovers the 'kingly' potential not only in himself, but in those around him. For the first time, Walter gets an inkling of the true vision of his great grandfather, the heroic King Jaja of Opobo.
