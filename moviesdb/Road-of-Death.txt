Road of Death

 Jack Miller whips Mac O'Connor and Al Douglas in a no-holds-barred fight to become the leader of an outlaw-motorcycle gang, and as a victory prize, Sherry Tabor becomes Jack's "Old Lady" and has to take on each gang member sexually...one-at-a-time. The gang comes upon two teenage couple swimming in a lake and Jack decides the gang needs a couple of new "Mamas." They overpower the girl's boyfriends, Frank Billings and Joe Banana, of the Joe Banan Thing band..and take the girls with them. Joe, whose thing is evidently fighting, is hospitalized, but Frank finds a wallet belonging to Miller, and sets out to rescue his sweetie, Liza Jensen, who may or may not desire any rescuing.
