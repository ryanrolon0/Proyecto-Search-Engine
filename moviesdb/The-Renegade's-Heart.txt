The Renegade's Heart

 George Fineld, a renegade, came close to the home of Violet Blake, the posse hard after him. Violet had seen the $5,000 reward sign, but, despite that, gave the renegade his chance and secreted him in her room. When he left the renegade unwrapped a handkerchief from about his neck, giving it to her with the remark that if she ever needed him to hang the handkerchief from the old tree. When Violet's father, deeply in debt, came home drunk one night and confessed to the embezzlement of $5,000. Then Violet thought of the handkerchief, hung it upon the tree, and the renegade gave himself up cheerfully.
