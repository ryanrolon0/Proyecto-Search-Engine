Swarg Yahan Narak Yahan

 Vijay Kumar lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Bombay along with his wife, Suman, and is employed as the Assistant Commissioner of Police. Several years after their marriage, Suman gives birth to Suraj, and both shower him with their respective love and affection, as a result Suraj grows up to be a brat, falls into bad company, steals, and misses school. Vijay gets upset and has him enrolled in a far-off boarding school. Several years later Suraj returns home, and is welcomed back by Suman and Vijay, who is now the Police Commissioner. At first Suraj hates his dad, but a change comes over him, both father and son reconcile their differences, and Suraj gets married to his sweetheart, Radha. What Vijay does not know is that Suraj is pulling wool over his parents' eyes and is leading a double life - and is involved in drugs and criminal activity - and soon Vijay will have to decide - turn a nelson's eye or arrest his only son.
