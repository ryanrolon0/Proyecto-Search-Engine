Strange Tastes

 Jenny, mourning the loss of her husband, has turned into a recluse. An unexpected visit from her sister, Carol, a mysterious traveling salesman and a home cooked meal all play into her strange tastes - and a hilarious short tribute to horror and suspense films created in just one weekend as a part of the 2005 National Film Challenge.
