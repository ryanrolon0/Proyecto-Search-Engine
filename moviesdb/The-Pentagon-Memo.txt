The Pentagon Memo

 The government contracted out to two labs. One to make an airborne virus that has a 48 hour incubation period and the other that is located in Post Katrina New Orleans that makes the antidote. In an attempt to cover up a security leak, a memo was sent to the military Project advisor General Lewis from The Pentagon to destroy all evidence of such tests. General Lewis feeling betrayed goes rogue and he steals the virus and kidnaps a woman's child. He instructs her to steal the antidote. Her child has 48 hours to live and in doing so she is chased by the Rouge elements of the U.S. Government Department of Defense . She calls her Ex-Husband " New Orleans Police Detective Sgt. James Bullitt" for help. Now it is up to James Bullitt in a high paced, action filled desperation to save his child and ex-wife. When it's all on the line there's no room for second chances . especially when you're the only chance they got.
