The Kirtan Party

 Trying to induce a state of higher consciousness in passersby, or at least raise their spirits, Gainesville's Krishna Conscious perform the sankirtan party several times daily. Sometimes calling it the 'kirtan party,' they parade song, dance, exotic instruments, and the several names of God through the heart of UF's campus. During the evenings, they even hit downtown and compete with local dance clubs. This short ethnographic documentary illustrates the kirtan party's present, historical, and spiritual contexts.
