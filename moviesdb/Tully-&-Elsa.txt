Tully & Elsa

 An evil alien crash-lands on Earth, intent on collecting specimens for his intergalactic zoo prior to his cruel race destroying Earth for its own purposes. Fortunately for us, this alien meets an adorable 7-year-old, unlike any creature he's ever encountered. Her kindness and friendship melt the alien's cold little heart, and she convinces him Earth is worth saving.
