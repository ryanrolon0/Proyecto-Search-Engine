Then I Shall Reign Supreme!

 Then I Shall Reign Supreme! deals with a a ten year old boy who likes to imagine that he is a medieval prince fighting an evil villain. The movie cuts between showing the beautiful medieval world that he is imagining and what is really going on in his back yard as he play-acts out his imagination with his friends. The contrast between what he imagines and what is actually happening causes many comic moments as he alienates his friends and gets into trouble because he won't distinguish between fantasy and reality.
