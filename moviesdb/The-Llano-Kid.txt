Travers is the manager of the Ibarra rancho and the plan is for the three of them to seize control, although the Travers also have plans to later cut the Kid out. The latter comes under the influence of Donna Teresa and Lupita Sandoval and eventually refuses to go through with the plot. When Travers tries to carry out the plan, the Kid and Sheriff McLane pair together and defeat Travers and his henchmen. The sheriff feels that the Kid's redemption is complete and gives him his freedom.
