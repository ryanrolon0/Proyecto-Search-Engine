Privilege

 "in that sleep of death what dreams may come.." (Hamlet) Privilege seeks to produce a subliminal confrontation with its ever-shifting subject matter, much as the body is reputed to create vortexes of healing and repose in response to traumas. Multiple, intersecting planes of experience, often mired in a sordid backstory of the American dream/empire (featured voices include Florida death row inmates, Palestinian poets, and novelist Kathy Acker) seek to produce new areas of resolution.
