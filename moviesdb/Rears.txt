Rears

 Bar owner Buster tests a new younger waitress and enlists Barfly Bernie for a double test. Scholar Michelle is a waitress whose opinionated soul objects to such matters. Nevertheless, she bares witness as buxom "wet panties" competitor Bambi lets the bartender show her to the couch. In the competition, Michelle steps up to prove she's not uptight. Discussing free choice in the changing room, Bambi and the new waitress hit on her. One competitor arrives late and asks the bartender to spend the night as total strangers. Now mistaken for a lesbian, Michelle storms out as Buster brings her Rose and Stacey. A bar goer pretends judging the contest to trick Rose into pleasuring him, leaving Stacey to use an urinal for a lack of alternative. The unique situation doesn't stop Stacey from seducing the bartender. Finally, Michelle confesses wanting Buster and has him on the bar.
