Sus

 When a suspicious looking character enters a late night liquor store and starts stashing bottles of wine into his jacket, the clerk decides it's best to empty the cash register before the bloke holds it up. Then a cop enters the store minutes later for a packet of chips to find the clerk stashing cash from the register and the suspicious bloke stashing bottles of wine. He promptly deals with the situation although it's not until he's left the store that he realizes all may not be as it seems.
