Three Little Pigskins

 The stooges are mistaken by a gangster for the "Three Horsemen of Boulder Dam", famous football players. Hired to play for his team, they blow the big game and get it in the end. Lucille Ball has a nice part as a gun moll. The Stooges are beggars in suits. They are hired to advertise the upcoming game at Boulder Dam in football uniforms, when they are mistaken for 3 great players by a gambler. But the trio can't turn down the big $ offer.
