Turning the Tide

 With hundreds of thousands of lives lost and miles of coastline destroyed, the Tsunami of 2004 is one of the greatest natural disasters in memory. Americans along with the rest of the world pledged billions of dollars to help. But thousands of volunteers have donated more-their time and themselves-to physically travel to the affected region and lend a helping hand to the millions in need of relief. In Turning the Tide Volunteers, we meet and travel with three unique American volunteers to Thailand and Sri Lanka as they give of themselves and get back more than they ever imagined.
