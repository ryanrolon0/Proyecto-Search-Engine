The Life and Times of Arthur Erickson

 The Life and Times of Arthur Erickson examines the life of this enigmatic architect and pays tribute to his achievements as a non-conformist and iconoclast. In a career spanning 50 years, he has created an unparalleled body of work that includes hundreds of buildings, many of them inspired by and designed to complement the Canadian landscape.
