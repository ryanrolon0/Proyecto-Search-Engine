Ue O Muite

 From 2006 to 2008 I experienced a series of losses my grandmother, uncle, and mother all passed away from various illnesses and old age. Inspired by the Kubler-Ross model, the film is split into five sections labeled according to the Five Stages of Grief. This film commemorates those that I've lost and represents my journey through the grief process.
