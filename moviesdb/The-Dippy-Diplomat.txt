The Dippy Diplomat

 A newspaper announces that Ivan Awfulitch, the famous ambassador, is due to have a barbecue with local resident Wally Walrus. Unfortunately, while Wally is preparing the barbecue, the scent of the steaks he is cooking attracts an unwelcome guest in the form of Woody Woodpecker. He steals some of the food through a knothole in the fence then uses a bow and arrow to get the rest. Wally throws him out but when Woody hears of the visitor he is expecting, he dresses as Awfulitch himself and finally gets the remainder of Wally's food.
