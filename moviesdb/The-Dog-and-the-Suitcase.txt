The Dog and the Suitcase

 Sarah, a young attractive girl who, whilst dog-sitting her neighbor's Labrador for the week returns home to find the dog dead. This is only the beginning of her problems as she journeys across the city to take the dog to the vets. Along the journey she is befriended by Mark, a young charming man who is only too willing to give her a helping hand.
