 In claymation, the Ontario Censor Board meets to consider an animated short, which begins simply enough, but soon scandalizes the Board with the sexual activities of its two characters corner, go to a bedroom, and soon are swinging on a chandelier. A dog joins them somehow, although by now, we see only the Board and its shocked response. The film finished, they must determine their rating darts and a dart board. What rating will the film receive? Will the morals of the people of Ontario be protected?
