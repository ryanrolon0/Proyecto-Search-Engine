Till Death

 A young woman wanders through streets that are eerily empty, except for a few Halloween revelers. She is disoriented, fragments of several incidents pierce her mind and collide with reality. A crash, a wedding, a woman who helps her; are they real, or do they exist only in her mind's eye?
