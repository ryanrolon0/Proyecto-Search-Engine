Technophilia

 A couple is in the middle of a relationship crisis. Inside a hangout place, the techie boyfriend is preoccupied by his Nintendo DS (just like the rest of the people engrossed with their own gadgets - laptops, mobile phones, iPods, mp3 players, PSPs, etc.); while the bored girlfriend seeks some attention from him. As they get into a heated argument, the characters become boxed up by the technology and lifestyle that cover their deeper emotions through the gadgets they use.
