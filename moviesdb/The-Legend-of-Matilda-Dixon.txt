The Legend of Matilda Dixon

 Supposing that all the events that occured in the film Darkness Falls (2003) were true, this would be the companion to the film since it offers a "real-life" history of the life of Matilda Dixon. This is a story of how an innocent woman was accused of murdering children without any shred of proof, she was then horribly disfigured and upon her death, vowed to get revenge on the town of Part Fairy.
