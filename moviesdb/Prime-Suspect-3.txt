Prime Suspect 3

 Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison moves to a new district and is put in charge of a vice investigation instead of homicide. But soon a homicide case impinges on her new job when a very young male prostitute is murdered in the apartment of Vera Reynolds, a female impersonator. Soon Jane is on the trail of the boy's brutal young pimp (played by David Thewlis). But her investigation is complicated by the Old Boy's Network, which is spying on her and is more concerned with preventing scandal than bringing the villain to justice. Having been passed over for promotion at Southampton Row police station, DCI Jane Tennyson's request for a transfer is approved and she finds herself heading the Vice Squad. They have a major investigation under way, known as Operation Contract, which is meant to root out a male prostitution ring involving underage boys. The day of her arrival coincides with a fire in which one of these young boys, Colin 'Connie' Jenkins, is found dead. There are several suspects including a known pimp, James Jackson as well as Edward Parker-Jones, the head of a local youth center where many of these boys congregate. As the investigation continues, Tennyson learns that Connie was trying to sell his story to a journalist with a promise to reveal an MP and very senior police officer as clients. In the midst of all this, Jane receives some surprising and potentially life-altering news from her doctor.
