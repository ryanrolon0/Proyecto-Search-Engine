Valley of Wanted Men

 Three men that were sent to prison for bank robbery escape. The stolen money was never recovered and they return to the scene looking for the fourth man who has the money. Two of the robbers are out to get the money for themselves but the other who was framed wants to recover the money so he can clear himself.
