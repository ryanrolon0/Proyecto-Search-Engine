The Comedians in Africa

 A behind the scenes short dealing with the making of _The Comedians (1967)_ (qv). Although the story takes place in Haiti, it was actually filmed in Dahomey (now called Benin). Includes short interviews with 'Alec Guinness' (qv), 'Paul Ford (I)' (qv), 'Richard Burton (I)' (qv) and others. Dahomey had been an independent nation for about 10 years when the film was made. The situation in Haiti was such that the film could not be made there but Dahomey was a close substitute and actually close in appearance to the setting. This promotional short shows the hardships faced by the cast and crew of _The Comedians (1967)_ (qv), when they filmed the movie in the African nation of Dahomey. The story takes place in Haiti, but political conditions in that country made filming there impossible.
