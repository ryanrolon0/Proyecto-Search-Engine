Vino Veritas

 On Halloween night, two middle-aged couples prepare to attend a friend's annual party. Though the evening begins as usual, familiar traditions slowly unravel when the foursome shares a bottle of South American ceremonial wine made from the skin of blue dart tree frogs. Under the influence of this tribal truth serum, they share an unpredictable and hilarious night of unbridled honesty that stretches the bounds of their friendship forever.
