Primitive Pitcairn

 This visit to Pitcairn Island in the South Pacific Ocean shows that life for the residents has changed little in the years since Fletcher Christian and his fellow mutineers on HMS Bounty, along with several Tahitian natives, landed here. The island is self-sufficient and has few visitors. Among the islanders we see at work is Fletcher Christian's great-grandson. Pitcairn Island is known through the story of Fletcher Christian's led mutiny against Bligh, the captain of the Bounty. The British mutineers and their Tahitian wives settled on Pitcairn. One-hundred fifty years later, two hundred residents live on the isolated island - isolated due to its great distance from shipping routes - all those being descendants of these mutinous settlers. Because of the isolation, life on Pitcairn has not changed much over that time period. It is an island of community, where everyone helps each other in getting tasks done. What little contact they have with the outside world is whenever a steamer ship comes by to barter for goods, the islanders trading their handicrafts for primarily lumber and flour.
