Seoul to Soul

 Seoul to Soul recounts the turbulent journey of Wade, a gay Asian man, from his devout, Mormon upbringing in Utah to his drug-fueled, fast-lane adult life in San Diego--a course fraught with pitfalls as he navigates a maze of addictions while searching for identity and self-acceptance. Told with disarming candor and insight, Wade's compelling story offers a universal message of hope that resonates with audiences of all ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations, and illuminates one of the many complex facets of the Asian-American experience.
