Viktor & I

 Viktor & I, An Alexander Vesely Film, is a movie about famous Holocaust survivor, Dr. Viktor Frankl, author of 'Man's Search for Meaning'. The book has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. Filmmaker, Alexander Vesely, traveled the world over to document the personal and unique side of this important man. For the first time in film, people will see Dr. Frankl through the eyes of those closest to him. A defining character of the 20th century, he was not only a genius, doctor and survivor of Nazi terror and tragedy but a man who lived, believed and loved. Making his US directorial debut, Vesely shares intimate glimpses of his eminent grandfather who, amidst great suffering also gave us all hope.
