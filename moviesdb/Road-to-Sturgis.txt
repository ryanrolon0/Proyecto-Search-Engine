Road to Sturgis

 Tired of the constant stream of losers in her life, Jessie escapes on her deceased fathers Harley Davidson motorcycle, and begins a personal odyssey across America where she encounters a depraved reject of society who sets his sites on her. Escaping his clutches in what would have been a horrific death, Jessie stumbles into the "biker world" where she finds safety in midst of people she would otherwise have rejected. On her journey she not only discovers herself but the legacy left behind by her father.
