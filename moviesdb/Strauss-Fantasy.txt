Strauss Fantasy

 In the red-paneled MGM Concert Hall, the MGM Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Johnny Green, plays polkas and waltzes from "gay, romantic, 19th-century Vienna" composed by Johann Strauss Sr., Johann Strauss Jr., and Josef Strauss. A voice-over narration introduces the program, which includes "On the Beautiful Blue Danube,""Pizzicato Polka," "Tales from the Vienna Woods," "Vienna Life," "The High Spirits Polka," "The Emperor Waltz," "Radetzky Waltz," and "Overture to the Bat." At least 70 musicians comprise the orchestra.
