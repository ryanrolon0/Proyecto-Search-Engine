The Devil's Window

 Preying on the lost and broken, Daniel strokes the souls of five drifters while indulging them at an isolated ranch in the grasslands. As the days go by, Daniel's mute brother Jude reveals to us with his video diary that the ranch, nicknamed 'the garden', develops into being more of an alter than a sanctuary for his guests. Methods in his madness ensue as Daniel reveals ambitious desires for his own spiritual rebirth, and what is unleashed is an unpredictable mind freak.
