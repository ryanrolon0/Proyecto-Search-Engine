 Greece in the years of Turkish occupation. The Ottomans make frequent raids and seize Greek children, whom they lead to training camps and turn them into Janissaries. In such a mass kidnapping of children they seize a distinguished Greek boy and raise him according to the rules of this militantly anti-Christian group. Many years later, the Greek boy, now a man and an Ottoman conqueror, returns to his village and clashes with his own kin.
