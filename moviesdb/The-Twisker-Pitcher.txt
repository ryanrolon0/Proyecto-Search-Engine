The Twisker Pitcher

 Baseball have girlfriends cheering them on. As they take the field, Popeye drops his spinach. Bluto eats it, then refills the can with grass. Popeye's team, with Popeye batting first, strikes out. Bluto's team, with Bluto batting fourth, gets 3 singles; Popeye eats his "spinach" (to no avail, of course), and Bluto gets a grand slam homer. Last inning Popeye at bat. Bluto's first pitch turns invisible. The second pitch hovers just before the plate. The third pitch turns all kinds of loops at the plate; Popeye has struck out. For some reason, Popeye then takes the mound. After another hit, Popeye plants some spinach seeds, and eats the quick-growing plant. He then throws two quick strikes (which he catches himself), then a hit which he catches himself, and so on, taking a bonus inning and winning the game 22-21.
