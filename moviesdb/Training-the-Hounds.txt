Training the Hounds

 A large pack of fox hounds are shown in the open country. The trainers are taking them over the section of ground which they think the fox will cover in the coming hunt. There are over one hundred dogs in the pack, and as they scamper around with noses to the ground, they present a pleasing spectacle. The scene now changes to the kennel at feeding time. The hounds are called to the troughs, but as they do not all answer at the same time, are driven back to the sheds and called again. This time they all come with a rush. Their food is placed in long troughs and as the dogs line up on both sides of these troughs they are seen to push one another aside in their wild excitement to get something to eat.
