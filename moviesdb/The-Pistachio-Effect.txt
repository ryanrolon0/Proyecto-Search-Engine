The Pistachio Effect

 The quirky tale of two mates who find themselves consuming thousands upon thousands of pistachio nuts - until at some point, they in themselves become consumed. A story about relationships, friendships and the lengths we'll go to save ourselves. It's a feel good story that not everyone feels good about.
