The Expressionist

 The Expressionist is a comedy that explores the effects on the human psyche of those who are celebrity obsessed and who wants to be famous and successful themselves. Bluring the boundaries between fiction and documentary, our protagonist is a celebrity-obsessed actor who's met most of the A-list stars. However, his excitement takes a new turn when he discovers that fame isn't everything but to express yourself is - but even the ability to express yourself isn't as easy as it seems.
