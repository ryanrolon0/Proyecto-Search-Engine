The Lamb and Flag

 In a rough British pub on the night of the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, a pub landlord struggles to control the increasingly drunk customers. As he tries to prevent them from trespassing on his private property and seizing his son, he relives the nightmare of losing his men to Communist troops during the Korean War. In the end he must decide whether to protect his boy or whether to throw him into the lions' den.
