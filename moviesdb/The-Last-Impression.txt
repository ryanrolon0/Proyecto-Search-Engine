The Last Impression

 Three friends - a misogynist, a neurotic, and a transvestite - in their first semester of college in New York City go out for a night on the town. One of them wakes up the next day with a lifeless girl in his bed, apparently the victim of severe alcohol poisoning. Out of desperation and panic, he convinces his friends to help him get rid of her body. A series of seedy misadventures, which involve cross-dressing, hallucinogens, and the Mafia, ensue.
