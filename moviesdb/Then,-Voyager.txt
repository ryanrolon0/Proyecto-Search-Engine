Then, Voyager

 Two lovers on the morning of their forced separation grapple with the conflicting imperatives of wartime pragmatism and psychological survival. THEN, VOYAGER synthesizes a modern approach and tone with timeless sentiment and elements of classic style in a truly innovative fusion that pushes the boundaries of genre as they are traditionally laid.
