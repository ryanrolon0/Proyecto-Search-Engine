Speed Date

 A silent, short romantic comedy set in the world of speed dating. An unnamed girl watches herself in the mirror as she gets ready for the 'speed date'. Her hopes and dreams are pinned on this one night. Will she find the man of her dreams or her worst nightmares? And will she come to realize that true love is always in the last place you look? Using music and colour, 'speed-date' weaves together a heartwarming story about finding that special someone who understands us as we truly are. Each character in the story has their own 'song'; a piece of music that represents and defines them. To find true love, the girl must find that special someone whose song 'mashes' with hers to create a new one.
