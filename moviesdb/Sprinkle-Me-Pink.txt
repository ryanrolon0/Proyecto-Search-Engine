Sprinkle Me Pink

 The Pink Panther's picnic gets ruined by a tiny raincloud which starts following him everywhere he goes. No matter where he tries to hide, the cloud sprinkles rain over him. It even gets into his house through the chimney. The panther manages to dump the cloud into the waste basket, but when he tries to drop the basket down a bridge, a policeman comes and orders him to release the cloud. Finally, the panther goes to a psychiatrist to get rid of the cloud.
