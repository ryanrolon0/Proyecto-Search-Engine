The Hayseed's Experience at Washington Monument

 Shows the base of the Washington Monument. A Rube appears upon the scene. As he is going to ascend the monument stairway, he sets down his bag and umbrella and refers to his guidebook. A sneak thief grabs the umbrella and grip and makes off with them. When Rube discovers his loss he calls a policeman and they start in hot pursuit. The thief runs around the monument with Rube and the policeman after him and finally enters the main stairway. He ascends the stairway followed by Rube and the policeman. He next appears at the little window at the top of the monument, and raising Rube's umbrella makes a parachute of it and jumps out. He descends slowly while the irate Rugbe and the policeman are left helpless at the top of the monument.
