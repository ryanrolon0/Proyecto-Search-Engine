Reflections on a Promise

 Twenty years ago thousands rejoiced when the Americans with Disability Act was signed into law. What began as an offshoot of the civil rights movement eventually became the ADA, a comprehensive mandate against discrimination on the basis of disability. Reflections on a Promise examines not only the history of this groundbreaking legislation, but also considers what the Act has accomplished, and how all Americans can help build on its successes. With equal consideration given to the past, present, and future of the ADA, Reflections on a Promise features eloquent commentary from some of America's foremost disability rights advocates.
