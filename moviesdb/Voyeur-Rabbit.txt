Voyeur Rabbit

 A lonely man-sized rabbit lives in Ocean City, NJ during the desolate off-season months. Though he fancies himself an artist, the Rabbit has been unable to create anything worthwhile. He becomes obsessed with a supermodel and is slowly driven insane. The Rabbit tries to distract his mind with various drugs and women.
