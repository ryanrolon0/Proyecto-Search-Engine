Rustlers' Ransom

 This Universal "Musical Western" short has Tex Williams, Smokey Rogers and Deuce Spriggins helping Leslie Banning (film debut) protect her interest against a gang of cattle rustlers. Universal spliced this film together with another Williams short, "Gold Strike", and sent it out in November of 1950 as a feature film, "Tales of the West No.3".
