Teen Getaway

 Two people in there early teens escape from a party. They end up lost in the woods and decide to live there indefinitely, before they are confronted with the inevitable fate that is being a suburban teenager. Kids can easily get seduced by the mundane, the average and the norm, thus beginning a life that may not be completely satisfying. When one is not satisfied they may result to numbing themselves further with drinking, drugs and sex. Teen Getaway is a fantasy for the average kid who may not be so lucky at getting away.
