Sierra Spirits

 Three of the goofiest cowboys in "1889" are hired by saloon owner (Buckshot) to hunt two dangerous men that robbed his saloon. These three goofy cowboys end up in a shootout at the okie dokie corral against the two robbers. Do they deliver the money to Buckshot and receive their reward or are they run out of town?
