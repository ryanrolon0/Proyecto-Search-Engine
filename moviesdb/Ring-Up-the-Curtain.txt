Ring Up the Curtain

 As a group of traveling players are about to arrive at the opera house where they have their next engagement, the manager of the house is in the process of venting his frustrations with his crew. Harold, one of the stage hands, takes a liking to one of the dancers, and he willingly helps her with her baggage - until he realizes that one of her props is a live snake, which causes turmoil when he allows it to get loose. Then, when the show begins, Harold ends up causing further disruptions.
