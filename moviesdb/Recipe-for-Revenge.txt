Recipe for Revenge

 Carly Hunter, who just started her own catering business, agreed to cook for a friend who wanted to impress TV star Dr. Chester Winnifield. From the kitchen she witnesses him murdering her friend, escapes and goes to the police, but has no proof while the press is on the celebrity' side. She now fears for her life, so police detective Jack Brannigan, who believes her, is assigned by the prosecutor to guard her in her home and investigate.
