Ren yu duo duo

 As a little girl, Dodo cannot walk. She associates herself with "The Little Mermaid" and wonders if she would give up something of her own in order to own a pair of feet. Fortunately, she gains a pair of feet after an operation, and hence is indulged in collecting and wearing beautiful shoes and heels even after she has grown up. She marries Smiley, a handsome but shy dentist. They live a happy life, except that Dodo still keeps buying shoes. Later, she reluctantly accepts Smiley's request to stop buying shoes, until one fateful day when she accidentally walks right into the shoe store ... Dodo, a young girl in a wheelchair, grows up listening to fairy tales. After an operation on her feet, she grows into a beautiful young woman with a passion for shoes -- which causes problems with her husband, Smiley. For the sake of domestic bliss, she gives up buying shoes -- but then she finds she can't walk any longer, and sinks into a depression.
