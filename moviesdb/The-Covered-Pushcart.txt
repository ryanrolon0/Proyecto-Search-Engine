The Covered Pushcart

 Sourpuss and Gandy Goose are touring the country by automobile pulling an ultra-modern trailer when they are attacked and invaded by a wild-west, non-modern Indian who wishes to scalp them. But he gets entangled in the machinery and blows himself sky-high when his scalping hatchet touches some electrical wires. Politically-incorrect by revisionists standards? Yes. Funny? Yes.
