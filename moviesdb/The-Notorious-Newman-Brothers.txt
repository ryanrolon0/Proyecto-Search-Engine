The Notorious Newman Brothers

 Gangsters have been covered before, but never like this! Join Max Chaplin, one of films most inexperienced directors, as he struggles to document Paulie and Thunderclap Newman on their ascension to mobster mediocrity. Hoping to penetrate the brothers tight bond, Max goes deep inside the duo to uncover the truth about wise guys, their influences, wizard ladies, mammoth-hair jackets, mobster charades, a little bit of manslaughter and easily one of the biggest dope deals of all time.
