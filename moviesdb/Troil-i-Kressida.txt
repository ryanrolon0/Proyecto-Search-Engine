Troil i Kressida

 On the seventh year of the Trojan War both sides are tired of fighting. Greek Generals Agamemnon and Ulisses are unhappy about Achilles's unwillingness to fight, and the Trojan King Priam is planning to return Helen to the Greeks to end the conflict. But a Trojan prince Troilus falls in love with Cressida, the daughter of the treacherous Trojan priest Calchas, who defected to the Greek side. Cressida's uncle Pandarus brings Troilus and Cressida together. But Cressida's father Calchas makes a deal with the Greek Lord Diomedes, who takes Cressida in a swap for a Trojan prisoner. Crafty Ulisses leads Troilus to witness Cressida with Diomedes. Infuriated Troilus pushes his big bother Hector into battle, where Patroclus (friend of Achilles) gets killed. Achilles fights back and kills Hector. The war goes on.
