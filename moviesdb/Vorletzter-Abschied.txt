Vorletzter Abschied

 Walter is packing. The days of living with his wife Martha shall end in a few hours. Martha is disoriented; confused and far from being the woman Walter married. She doesn't recognize him, believes him to be someone else, acts aggressively. The changes in Martha's nature have forced Walter to come to a decision - he no longer wants to live with his wife. Walter has already chosen a nursing home for Martha. The day of goodbye has arrived. In a few hours, Martha will leave for her new home. Now Walter has to make her understand.
