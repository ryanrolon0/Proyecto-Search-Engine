 A successful young Athenian lawyer, Theodora, who is the daughter of a general, takes on the case of Mantzavinos who is a grocer in Kolonos. Trying to avoid the usual hum-drum approach, she becomes involved with a strange gang with a blind beggar for a leader, Linos, a former teacher, and current idol, of hers, who seems to Theodora like a modern Oedipus. Linos' companion and right-hand man is the former caretaker of the school. The group is completed by two sister-hookers, Anta and Mina, who work in a brothel housed in the school building and who sometimes force Linos to beg for money. The gang is planning a "big score", the theft of the antiquities of Plato's Academy, but Theodora's reluctance, combined with the timely intervention of the police, cancel the plan.
