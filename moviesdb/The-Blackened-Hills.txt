The Blackened Hills

 This allegorical picture gets up quite a strong interest as it proceeds. It contains a witch-like creature, hobbling long with a crutch, an evil hearted woman, a perfectly good hero and a perfectly bad villain. Besides these there is a good little girl, around whom most of the interest centers. The witch repays the kindness shown her by the hero and the good little girl, by saving their lives. She also sets fire to the evil woman's beautiful hillsides as just vengeance for her selfishness. The California setting helps along the fairy story type of film, which has by no means been exhausted.
