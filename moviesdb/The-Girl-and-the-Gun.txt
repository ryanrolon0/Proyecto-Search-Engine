The Girl and the Gun

 Pauline had always been a splendid shot, and her lover, the Sheriff, approved of her remarkable marksmanship with the whole hearted praise of a boy. One day Scorpion Bill and Spider Jack planned a raid on the girl's home. They assaulted her and her father and escaped with the swag. The Sheriff made plans for immediate pursuit. A revolver battle on horseback followed, and the Sheriff lost track of his birds. We see them later dividing the swag and carousing, until a quarrel ensued. This the Sheriff interrupted, giving a hot chase to Bill. The latter rode towards a great high trestle overhanging the valley. Nimbly, he climbed its great height, closely followed by the Sheriff. Suddenly, he found all cartridges gone, and thinking quickly, swung his rope over the trestle and started down. The Sheriff followed his prey down the rope. They met at a height of 60 feet from the ground and a hand-to-hand battle took place in mid-air. Meantime, Spider Jack, watching the frightful battle, climbed rapidly up the trestle. He drew his gun, then changed his mind and hauled forth a wicked looking knife, with which he began to cut the rope. Down on the ground, observing the desperate battle of her lover, Pauline took careful aim at Bill. Then suddenly she saw Jack's figure on the trestle top, and divined his plan. Again she aimed, this time at Jack. When her rifle sent its deadly missile upwards the body of Jack hurtled to the ground. At the same time the Sheriff, having obtained a throathold on his antagonist, pushed his slowly backwards until his body, too, joined that of his confederate.
