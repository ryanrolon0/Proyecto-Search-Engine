The Museum on the Mountain

 A Japanese mother and daughter wish to start an art museum with their collection. The location is a nature preserve deep in the Japanese mountains. I.M. Pei is contracted as the architect. The project faces several hurdles must be sloped, and so on. The architect, owners, and builders surmount all obstacles. A magnificent and innovative bridge connects visitors to the tunnel by which they enter the museum. After construction is complete, a large percentage of the building is covered with earth, which is then reforested to give the illusion that the site was hardly disturbed. Interviews with I.M. Pei show his awe and gratitude at being involved with such a grand project.
