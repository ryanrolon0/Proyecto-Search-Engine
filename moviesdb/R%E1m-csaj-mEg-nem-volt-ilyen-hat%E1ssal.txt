 Miklos, a magazine photographer, has a hard time finding the girl of his dreams. But in the summer of 1992 in Budapest, he meets Dora at a club and feels a strange attraction to her. But he feels no compulsion in pursuing the relationship. They meet more by chance than by design. When they go to bed, it's out of fatigue, no desire. and when they break up, he doesn't quite know how to feel.
