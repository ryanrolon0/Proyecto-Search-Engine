 The trouble begins when a disgruntled gas station attendant plots a robbery against his former boss. He and his gang attack the owner's brother, stealing the daily cash deposit and leaving him stranded on the highway. Off duty, Sgt. Aguilar notices the stranded victim and stops to help. The two immediately take off in a dangerous chase....a chase that leaves one man dead and the police waging revenge on all the offenders!
