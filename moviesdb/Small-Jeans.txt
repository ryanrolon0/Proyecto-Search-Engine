Small Jeans

 'This is me. My name is Zoe. And I own a pair of small jeans. ' Zoe is a 22 year old artist whose life is in a kind of chaos. Ignoring all of her real problems, she is consumed with apocalyptic fears and fixates on one goal to find a suitable owner for a pair of tiny pants she has never been able to fit into herself. Her quest provides the perfect opportunity to indulge her obsession with a mystery girl who may or may not be a prostitute. And she may even get to save her new friend from a wicked world. But Zoe discovers some people just don't want to be saved, and her failed mini-adventure in philanthropy leads Zoe inevitably back to finally face her own problems.
