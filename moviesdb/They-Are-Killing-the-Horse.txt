They Are Killing the Horse

 An intriguing tale of a girl, Noori (Tehzeeb Jaffar), who spends her time doing "chilla-kashi" (meditation) in front of a candle, and fantasizing about a dream lover who comes to her on horseback. She finds this make-believe love-making a biological outlet in the socially repressed world she lives in. But then, during a Muharram procession, she panics while watching the symbolic killing of Imam Hussain's horse. The film follows her mental disintegration and depicts in a very real sense, the story of her background and the society she lives in.
