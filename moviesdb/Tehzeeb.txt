Tehzeeb

 Rukhsana Jamal and Anwar had been married for several years, and have two daughters, Tehzeeb and Nazeen, from this marriage. Anwar goes through a period of mental instability and depression, which ends in his committing suicide by shooting himself dead. Years later Tehzeeb and Nazeen have both grown up. Tehzeeb has married Salim Mirza, while Nazneen is mentally unstable. Their fairly smooth lifestyle changes abruptly when Tehzeeb finds out that Salim is having an affair with Sheena Roy; and Nazneen comes across a loaded revolver. Rukhsana Jamal is an invincible singer who has been recording private albums besides filing playback to film songs, since years. Come trends and fads, she's a survivor. A one stage of her career a major scandal had erupted. Her daughter Tehzeeb has never forgiven her. In fact she has sought to move away from the shadow of her mother. After a break of nearly 5 years, the mother and daughter meet for a reconciliation. They two are excruciatingly polite with each other until the masks of courtesy fell.
