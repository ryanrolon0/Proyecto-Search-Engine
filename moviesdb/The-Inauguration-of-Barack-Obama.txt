The Inauguration of Barack Obama

 The following short film is an account of two proud Americans who wanted to witness history in the making. It entails four days of Inaugural events, which includes photographs and video clips that are set to music.

Day two highlights the We Are One concert at the Lincoln Memorial. On day three, historical sites and museums of downtown Washington, DC were explored. Day four concludes on Inauguration day where the couple experienced the Inaugural parade. History was made and it will never be forgotten.
