Two-Fisted Sheriff

 Another of the Charles Starret westerns that was billed above the title as a "Peter B. Kyne Production" and story in which Kyne had nothing to do with the production or the story other than allowing his name to be used for selling purposes. This is a remake of Columbia's 1932 "Cornered" that starred Tim McCoy. Bob Pearson (Bruce Lane, also known as Yancey Lane)saves the life of his friend, Sheriff Dick Houston (Charles Starrett), who has captured two stagecoach bandits and is about to be shot from ambush by a third. Bob is found a few days later near the murdered body of cattleman Herrick (Dick Rush) with a gun in his hand. Herrick had been a vocal objector to Bob's courtship of his daughter Molly (Barbara Weeks.)Dick is forced to arrest Bob, who is tried and found guilty. While Dick holds off a lynch mob, Molly helps Bob escape. Dick loses his job and, knowing his friend will be a fugitive and he himself will be disgraced as long as Herrick's killer is at large, Dick heads for the town of Buckhorn where Herrick also had a ranch. There, Dick finds that Bob has joined a gang of rustlers headed by Laughing Bill Slagg (Alan Sears.) Later, he and Bob meet and Bob says he joined the gang in the hope of unearthing the killer of Herrick. Dick calls a meeting of the cattlemen and outlines a plan that he knows will be reported to Slagg by a traitor among the cattlemen. Sheriff Dick Houston's friend Bob has been accused of murder. Dick defends him at his trial but he is found guilty. When Bob's girl friend lets him escape jail, Dick is relieved of his Sheriff's badge. This lets him leave and he finds Bob in a town controlled by the outlaw Bill Slagg. Dick organizes the ranchers to fight Slagg and it's not long before he also finds the real killer.
