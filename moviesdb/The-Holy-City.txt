The Holy City

 We are the first to attempt to make a Motion Picture of this well known song ("Last night I lay sleeping, There came a dream so fair..."), and after the expenditure of several thousand dollars and two month's labor, we have succeeded in producing a masterpiece. There is nothing like it anywhere, and you want it if you are looking for a feature film. This film will remain on the screen as long as it requires to sing the song. In 38 Life Motion Tableaux.
