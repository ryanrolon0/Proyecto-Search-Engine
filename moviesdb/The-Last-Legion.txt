The Last Legion

 Circa 460 A.D. Mira was born in a warrior-family in Kerala, India, was well versed in martial arts and self-defense, so much so that she was recruited by the Spanish royalty and re-located to Constantinople. From there she was instructed to assist Roman Commander Aurelius to plan the escape of 12-year old Romulus Augustus Caesar from a prison in Capri after his parents had been killed by the leader of the Alliance in turmoil-stricken Rome that has seen the deaths of five emperors in five years. Mira, Aurelius, and a Priest, Ambrosinius, along with a handful of loyal soldiers were successful in the escape plan and deliver Romulus to Roman Senator Nestor. What the crew do not realize is that their task is not over yet, for Nestor is all set to betray Romulus, leaving them with no alternative but to flee to Britannia, where they will be forced to confront a seemingly invincible Vortygn, whose main aim is to obtain a powerful sword that was meant for defense and defeat, and also ensure the death of Romulus at any and all costs. In 460 AD, the Goths leaded by Odoacer invade Rome; kill the parents of the Caesar Romulus Augustus and send the boy and his tutor Ambrosinus to a prison in Capri. The govern of Constantinople together with Senator Nestor send the warrior Mira to help the loyal commander Aurelius to rescue Romulus with a few soldiers that have survived the attack and bring him to Constantinople. They succeed in their mission but when they return, they discover that they have been betrayed by Nestor. Without any other alternative, they navigate to Britannia to meet the last Roman legion, but they have a huge surprise.
