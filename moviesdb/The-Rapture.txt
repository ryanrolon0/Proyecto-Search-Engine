The Rapture

 Trust world than any could fathom. What happens when sabotage, deceit, and betrayal push trust to the breaking point? When Midael and Abaddon, two enhanced humans (Chimaeras out like daggers, Abaddon/Job with a 15' long metal tail can manipulate energy), become part of a high-stakes and violent game of cat-and-mouse. Each Chimaera learns just how much trust can be lost when everyone they meet has an agenda. Soon, the two must change their own agendas as they are dragged further into a chaotic realm of hatred, illusion, and death. When the pieces finally fall into place, where will their allegiances lie? As trust becomes merely a myth, will they find themselves becoming part of the very organizations that sought to use them, or will they break free and seek out destinies of their own making?
