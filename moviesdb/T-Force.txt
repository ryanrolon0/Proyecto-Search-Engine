T-Force

 In the near future, after a hostage situation goes awry, the last resort option of law enforcement, cybernaut unit T-Force, is ordered to be disassembled. But the robots see this as a "threat to their self-preservation" and go on a killing rampage. It's up to police lieutenant Jack Floyd and one of the cybernauts, who is on the right side of the law, to bring them down.
