The Early Morning Attack

 "This shows a body of U.S. Infantrymen attacking a fore of Filipino Insurgents, who are strongly entrenched on a high hill. The U.S. soldiers make a gallant chart up the hill, headed by an officer mounted on a white horse, and after fierce fighting, capture the Filipino stronghold."
