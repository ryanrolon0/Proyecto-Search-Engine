The Morning Party

 Having drifted apart since high school, three childhood-friends, fueled alternately by testosterone and loyalty, drive the vacant city streets hunting down whoever is responsible for brutally assaulting their pal hours earlier. Tempers flair as the long-nights journey into morning causes each friend to consider the path his life has taken and reveals that revenge is now the only tie that binds. When they finally confront their quarry an inevitable explosion of violence occurs and blinding rage is revealed in a most unexpected place. As the day breaks and the city begins to stir, the young men drive home in silence.
