Tarzan and the Trappers

 Tarzan deals with the villainous Schroeder, who is illegally collecting animals for zoos, only to be menaced by Schroeder's hunter brother Sikes, out for revenge, who teams up with greedy trader Lapin in a hunt for human game...Tarzan himself. Re-edited from 3 episodes of a never-shown TV series, with studio action intercut with location and wildlife footage. Jane has little to do.
