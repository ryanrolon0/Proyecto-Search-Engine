Trophy Wife

 A Russian mob family places all bets on their prize child, Lena. From a young age, she is primed to marry up, and their sights are set on the tony Upper East Side. As soon as she arrives, she encounters a temptation her parents hadn't planned for. Meet Billie, twenty-seven-year-old free spirit/music producer. She may have been raised in the least posh corner of Brooklyn, but her swagger says it all lacks. And everyone who is anyone, no matter what their borough, knows and loves it. There is one thing missing from her cultishly glamorous life, and that's love. Enter Lena. But can it last past closing time?
