The Flame Song

 In the kingdom of Florestan, a weak Prince Henry is ousted from power by his calculating cousin, Prince Basil. While exiled in Paris, Henry learns that the people are suffering under the tyranny of Basil's corrupt monarchy and decides to return to his homeland. Posing as the chauffeur of a traveling playboy--who is in reality Henry's manservant--he manages to make it across the border unmolested. But how will he be able to reclaim the throne?
