Richard Meier in Rome

 Building a church in Rome is a challenge, but Richard Meier's Jubilee Church meets this challenge comfortably. Thus Meier joins Bernini, Borromini, and the other architects of the great churches of Rome with a white modernist design, his first ecclesiastical building. Richard Meier gives a tour of his church which resembles soaring white sails. Three curved walls separate three distinct spaces weekday chapel and the baptistry, each with its own entrance. As a contrast he shows us his favorite churches in Rome by his famous colleagues from earlier times.
