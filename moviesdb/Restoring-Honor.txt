Restoring Honor

 This film tells the story of Henry Vinton Plummer a Maryland slave who was appointed the first African American Chaplain in the regular Army. Chaplain Plummer's appointment was equivalent to the rank of Captain and, as to be expected at that time in American history, created internal conflict within the Army's white officer ranks. This strife, in combination with a disgruntled African American enlisted man's questionable accusations, led Chaplain Plummer to face the charge of "Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and a Gentleman." After a suspect court martial, Chaplain Plummer was dishonorably discharged in 1894. Over one hundred years later, the film recounts the dedicated efforts of The Committee to Clear Chaplain Plummer, which is led by Committee President the Reverend L. Jerome Fowler, who is also Chaplain Plummer's great nephew. Composed of family, clergy, historians, scholars, and retired military personnel, The Committee waged a four-year legal and PR campaign to convince the Army to reinstate Chaplain Plummer and clear his name. The Committee worked tirelessly to research the case and garner support from public leaders and noted officials including Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich and the Maryland House and Senate.
