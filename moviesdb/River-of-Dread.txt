River of Dread

 There's radiation in them hills... What will happen if it gets stronger? Who will stop it? The challenge is met by four intrepid scientists. Dr. Mitch Mitchell (Dave Deshler), his wife Rosalee (Deanna Nairns), their foreign colleague Dr. Goran (F.M. Turner) and the mysterious Dr. Frank Peter (Jack Bennett). Along with some reluctant grad students, the empirical quartet hikes deep into the mountains to confront the threat at the source...but they are unprepared for the horrors that await them. Invisible skeletons! An alien robot! Theoretical giant monkeys! This is just the beginning of the lunacy in River of Dread, a tongue-in-cheek homage to science fiction films of the 1950's and the feature debut of writer-director Seneca Haynes.
