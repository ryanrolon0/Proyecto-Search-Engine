Third Trinity, Cambridge, Winning the Race for the Grand Challenge Cup. Taken at Henley on July 10th, 1902

 In this picture we bring into view the famous Third Trinity of Cambridge winning the Grand Challenge Cup by a scant half boat length, in a most exciting finish with the Leander crew. The crews pass close to our camera, and the audience can scarcely make out who is the winner, so close is the finish. A very fine film in every respect.
