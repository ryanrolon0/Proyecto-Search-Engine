Team Picture

 A realistic character study of a young man in his early 20's negotiating a disintegrating relationship with an ambitious artist / photographer girlfriend and an ascending fling with an adventurous floater, as well as pressures from his family and society to go to college / make steps toward success, all the while becoming increasingly interested in the questionably viable life of playing guitar and writing songs.
