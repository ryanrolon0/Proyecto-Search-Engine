Stephen Faulkner

 After briefly considering hanging up his hat, singer-songwriter Stephen Cassonade Faulkner decides to tour again with a young group led by musician Carl Prevost. This urban cowboy and timeless independent artist, who has always followed his own uncompromising path whatever the consequences, takes us along with him on the road between Quebec City and Gaspesie, Abitibi and Montreal. We watch rehearsals and shows and are privy to grand plans and disappointments. Glass of brandy and cigarette in hand, the iconoclastic singer, who is not a man to mince words, lets us know through this film that no matter what, against all odds, he's coming back.
