The Murder of Jonathan Ripley

 It was supposed to be Jonathan Ripley's birthday, but one of his guests left him the gift of a dagger in the heart. Three suspects. Three very different stories. One film noir with a twist as sharp as a curl of lemon in a stiff martini. And a mystery so stylish you won't want to take your eyes off it for a moment.
