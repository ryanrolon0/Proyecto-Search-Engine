Through Hell

 In a dark and blood smeared shed miles outside of town, Michael battles for the life of Rebecca, the woman he loves. For four days now, her mind has been the battleground where a series of demons have driven her to unspeakable acts of evil and depravity. Convinced that he is the only one who might be able to save her, Michael fights his way through the horrors of haunted cemeteries, maddening forests, and a cursed mansion.
