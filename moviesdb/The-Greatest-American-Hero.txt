The Greatest American Hero

 A revamp of the successful '80s television series by Stephen J. Cannell, where an ordinary school teacher is given superhuman powers after receiving a super-suit by aliens. Unfortunately he loses the instruction manual and is clumsy in the utilization of his powers. Together with Bill Maxwell, an old-school FBI agent, and now a sidekick, named Ashley Rizzo, they battle crime in ways that fall into the comedic category. **used with permission, but the production is in no way affiliated with the Cannell Company**
