The World Beyond

 Sportswriter Paul Taylor, after a near-death experience on the operating table, can hear the voices of the recently dead. These voices direct him to people who need help from supernatural dangers. In this story, his mission takes him to a remote Canadian island haunted by a creature made from mud and clay. The only thing which can harm this mud golem is salt.
