Sex, the City and Me

 Jessica 'Jess' Turner, the only female trader in a City firm, shamelessly cheats on her doting husband Patrick with her equally adulterous boss Michael Thompson to obtain early promotion and unfair bonuses. When the Turners chose to have a baby, Jess basically intends to leave it with a nanny after maternity leave. But the boys have decided to keep temp Tamara, promoted her former deputy Shafi Amid to co-team-leader and divided her accounts. Despite a lawyer's warning a trial would cost about the possible compensation and ruin her career anyway, she turns hostile on all colleagues and insists on formal proceedings against Thompson. The firm plays hardball too, no competitor will hire her. This egocentric attitude ends up estranging even her husband, but after a hesitation she pushes on to court.
