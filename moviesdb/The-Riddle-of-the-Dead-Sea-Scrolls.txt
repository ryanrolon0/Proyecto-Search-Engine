The Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls

 This documentary is based on the controversial theory espoused by Australian Dr. Barbara Thiering's book, "The Qumran Origins of the Christian Church," that the unnamed figures referred to in the Dead Sea Scrolls are John the Baptist and Jesus. Conventional wisdom is based on paleographic analysis of the writing suggests that they were written in the First Century B.C., before they were born and likely refer to the Maccabees.
