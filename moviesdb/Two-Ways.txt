Two Ways

 Two men climb a rocky, lifeless looking mountain. Their efforts are strenuous and the mood is tense. As we follow the youngest man on foot, we can feel his increasing anxiousness of keeping up. When his tension grows to a peak, something breaks. While losing foothold, almost falling, we stumble upon a different path.
