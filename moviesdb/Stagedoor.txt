Stagedoor

 Stagedoor is a documentary about the Stagedoor Manor summer camp, a theatrical program in the Catskills where all kinds of kids go to participate in productions. The documentary focused on five kids, but didn't delve too deeply or focus too much on just these five kids. The movie spent a lot of time looking at the overall camp culture. It's hard enough being a teen-ager if you fit in. Now imagine that you listen to Sweeney Todd, West Side Story, and Cats instead of Jay-Z and Beyonce. When you grow up, you want to star in a Broadway show. Luckily for these kids, there's Stagedoor Manor, a theater camp in the Catskill Mountains, where they come to bask in the glow of their personal spotlight - or escape from it.
