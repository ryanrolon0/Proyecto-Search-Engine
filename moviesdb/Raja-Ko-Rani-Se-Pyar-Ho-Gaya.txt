Raja Ko Rani Se Pyar Ho Gaya

 Mohit, a young man raised into beliving in fairy tales, comes to Bombay to find Manisha, a young woman whom he saved from drowning in a lake near his village, whom he belives to be an actual mermaid princess. Mohit shacks up in his estranged brother's apartment and looks after his three children, with a little of Manisha's help, which takes a turn when Mohit finds himself in posession of a super smart but troublesome, baby elephant which shows up on his doorstep and he tries to keep it a secret from the rest of the neighborhood. Dadimaa (Dina Pathak) has brought up her grandchilden, especially Mohit Kumar (Arvind Swamy) on bed-time happy-ending stories. Mohit, now grown-up, still believes in those stories. He rescues a young lady from drowning, and falls in love with her, without even knowing her name, which is Manisha (Manisha Koirala). Claiming that the statue of Lord Gajendra (or Lord Ganesh) has been stolen by Manisha, he journeys to Bombay city, and visits his brother Rohit Kumar (Dalip Dhawan). Rohit and his dad, Thakur Veerendra Pratap Singh (Goga Kapoor) have not spoken to each other, ever since Rohit married Meera (Tanvi Azmi), who is of a different caste. Mohit meets with Manisha, and Manisha accidentally breaks Lord Gajendra's statue, leaving Mohit devastated and full of fear. She makes amends by buying him Lord Gajendra in real life - a baby elephant. Chaos reigns as Mohit attempts to hide the elephant in his brother's Versova apartment. In the meantime Manisha is expected to marry another man, with whom she was bethrothed in her childhood. This leaves Mohit with a broken heart and an elephant he is unable to manage, and look after.
