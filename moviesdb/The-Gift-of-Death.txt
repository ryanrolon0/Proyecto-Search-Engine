 You can't cheat Death forever. Or can you? The Gift of Death is a fantasy folk story in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm, with some twists in the tale. A young man has Death as his godmother and she gives him the ability to bring the sick back from the brink of dying - but only sometimes. He becomes famous and successful, but ultimately finds his own life in jeopardy.
