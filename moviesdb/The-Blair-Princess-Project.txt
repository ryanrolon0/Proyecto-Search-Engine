The Blair Princess Project

 In August of 1999, two of Blair's oldest friends (Shannon and Paula) pick up one of her college pals, Coley, whom they've never met, and set out from L.A. for Malibu where Blair is getting married. Shannon puts herself in charge of the map, and soon they're parked at the base of a hill, walking up a narrow trail. Before too long, the map has been put to more practical uses, they're lost, and strange things begin to happen.
