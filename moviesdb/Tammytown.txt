Tammytown

 Tammie Pritchett (Anna Kaye) transfers to Hellgate High for a second chance to graduate and unwittingly stirs up a social hornet's nest when she meets a nice new boy and a nice new girl, both interested in her, and both taboo. Determined to make it through her final year, Tammie finds herself falling into old patterns and questioning her desires.
