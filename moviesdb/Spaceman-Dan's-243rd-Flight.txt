Spaceman Dan's 243rd Flight

 In Chicago, a disturbed call girl obsessed with an unfinished children's story inspires her would-be executioner to return her to the life she lived before her fall from grace. Meanwhile on a decaying farm, two abandoned children journey to a remote hilltop, where the elder boy holds a surprise for his sister--a secret place where stories collide.
