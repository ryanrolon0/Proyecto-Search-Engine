Tucson Raiders

 In Elliot's initial appearance as Red Ryder, he finds himself framed for murder. Little Beaver then foils the crooked Sheriff's attempt to have Red killed excaping jail. When Hannah Rogers gives the Sheriff a note, Red sees her give him a signal. Gabby lifts the note and Red decodes it. The Duchess then gets a confession from Hannah enabling Red to set out after the outlaws. In 1895, Painted Valley is ruled by Governor York. "Gabby" Hopkins and the Duchess oppose his rule but are helpless, until the Duchell sends for her nephew, Red Ryder. Red arrives, accompanied by Little Beaver, in time to be arrested for the murder of a man mistaken for Judge Stark, an old-time friend of the Duchess, for whom she has also sent for. Hannah Rogers, in the pay of York, engineers a trick to get Red out of jail. It boomerangs, and Red, aided by Little Beaver, shoots his way out. He intercepts a payroll robbery, but Little Beaver is captured by the crooks. Red exposes Hannah's duplicity to the Duchess and, while the women fight, Red rides to Little Beaver's rescue and breaks up York's gang.
