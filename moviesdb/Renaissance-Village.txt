Renaissance Village

 Acclaimed New Orleans native Wendell Pierce (Ray, The Wire) narrates this gritty look at the delicate relationship between government and citizen in the wake of disaster. Filmed on location in the small city of Baker, Louisiana, Renaissance Village follows the personal struggles of five characters to reclaim their lives after living nearly three years in a FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) trailer park. After allegations of formaldehyde poisoning force the park to close, residence must leave to find a new home. Paul, an auto-mechanic from New Orleans who lost everything in the storm, directs his grievances toward the camera, "Why do we put this all on the government?" and answers, "Because there's no one else to put it on." But where is the line drawn line between villain and victim? Who is truly responsible when disaster strikes?
