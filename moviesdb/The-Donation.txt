The Donation

 Claire gets a small package in the mail; it's a DVD from a sperm bank with filmed interviews of potential donors. She wades through a series of losers, including a singing nerd, a lisping braggart, a dim trucker, a fetishist, and a transvestite, before hitting pay dirt. Then, sonogram in hand, she bumps into someone in the park. Is destiny at work?
