Universal Special

 This Universal musical short was filmed in Lake Tahoe and features the music of Louis Prima, Keely Smith, and Sam Butera and the Witnesses. There is an effort to use some added dialogue, between songs, to provide a short story line. Music heard includes Mocking Bird" - "The Sheik of Araby" - "The Birth of the Blues" and others. Much of what's seen here also served as archive footage of a 1999 compilation film about Louis Prima.
