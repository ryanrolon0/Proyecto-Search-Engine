The Reverie

 The Reverie is the story of Autumn, a young woman who has just lost love. She learns to reconnect with the child within and find her independence through the aid of a mystical dragonfly from her childhood. The Reverie weaves live action with a digitally animated dragonfly, leading the audience on a dance-like visual and musical journey through the surreal.
