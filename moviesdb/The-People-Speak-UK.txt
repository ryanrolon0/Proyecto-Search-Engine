The People Speak UK

 The People Speak is a celebration of the forgotten and famous-dissenters, rebels, and visionaries-from Britain's past and present. Through dramatic and musical performances based on primary source materials, The People Speak brings to life extraordinary moments in UK history when ordinary people have spoken out for change.
