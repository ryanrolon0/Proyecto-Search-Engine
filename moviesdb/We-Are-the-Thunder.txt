We Are the Thunder

 This video was primarily shot at the Apache prisoner of war cemetery at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. Sounds of distant field artillery thundering over the graves echoed the forces that silenced these lives and voices more than one hundred years before. With themes of creation, the buffalo dance and ghost dance, this experimental video incorporates some of the earliest film records of these dances performed by Sioux members of the Buffalo Bill Wild West show and produced by the Edison company in 1894. Native music and voices along with original prose and music make up the soundtrack. Lyrical excerpts of the buffalo and ghost dances of the Sioux, Kiowa, and Paiute people are augmented by an original composition by DeWayne Austin and Byron Sakamoto which was inspired by the medicine song of Geronimo.
