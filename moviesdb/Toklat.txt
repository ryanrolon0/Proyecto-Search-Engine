Toklat

 A poor old mountain man returns to the wild Oregon countryside to find a grizzly bear he named Toklat. He recalls his old days with the bear, from rescuing him as a cub to teaching him how to hunt. He finally finds Toklat and faces the true reason he is after him rancher's livestock, and the mountain man badly needs the bounty money.
