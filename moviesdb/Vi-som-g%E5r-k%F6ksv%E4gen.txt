Vi som går köksvägen

 Helga Breder is a young, spoiled girl. To her beloved Jörgen she says that she, as a modern young woman is multi-talented and can do whatever she likes. Jörgen bets that she can't work as a house-maid but, if she manages it, he will buy her a diamond ring. Helga becomes a house-maid at Vinger Mansion and falls in love with an inventor, Bertil Frigård, who lives there.
