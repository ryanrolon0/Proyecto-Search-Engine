We Can't Have Everything

 Socialite Charity Cheever, though neglected by her unfaithful husband, tells her would-be lover Dyckman to find another which he does. When she is finally divorced, Dyckman is already married. But the new Mrs. Dyckman is already in love with a Marquis so an opening appears. A married couple, each in love with another, attempts to unentangle themselves from their marriage in order to be with the one each truly loves. But the more they untangle one knot, the faster more confusing knots appear.
