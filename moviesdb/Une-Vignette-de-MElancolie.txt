Une Vignette de MElancolie

 Suicide itself immediately. So often conventional filmmaking depicts suicide as being an event, a moment, a reaction, a climactic decision that is made impulsively. But conventional films fail to recognize suicide as "a way of life". This story is about a young man with depression and suicidal ideation occurring every moment of every day. Even when life is at its best, the thoughts of suicide consume him. The intention of this film is to convey the emotions involved with and attached to depression and suicidal logic. To explain this with the conventional forms of narrative are wholly inadequate, vis-á-vis this story deals with nothing but unconventional feelings and emotions. The only way to tell this story of depression and perpetual suicidal ideation is to find its "objective correaltive" display a combination of images, objects, and descriptions that evoke the emotions found within the character, and thereafter convey those to the audience. The source of this emotional logic isn't in one particular object, one particular image, or one particular word. Instead, this story originates in the combination of these phenomena when they appear together, as they do in this experimental film.
