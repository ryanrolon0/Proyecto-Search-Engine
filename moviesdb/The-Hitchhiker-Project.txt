The Hitchhiker Project

 The Hitch Hiker Project is a fresh take on classic Film Noir and Femme Fatale crime thrillers. Sparks fly when Sophie a cover-model and Clair an ambitious young designer decide to let lose and party after a fashion shoot. They invite Clair's boyfriend Josh along for the ride. The idea of easy money is broached. Josh suggests a friend who could be of use. He'll lend them a brick of cocaine and they'll sell it for an easy profit. One condition until the police knock on Josh's door. Panicked, he flushes all the evidence and profits down the drain. Now the three of them owe a hundred grand to a very heavy dealer. Desperate, they hatch a plan.
