Remember Fender

 The life of an artist is never easy, but even less so, when the artist was a child genius. Remember Fender looks back on the life of Video Artist, Ralph Fender with accounts from family members, his closest associates, the World Video Art Association, and the artist himself. The four video art pieces, widely known as 'Fender's Four', as well as some archival footage and unreleased videos are presented and discussed as the documentary attempts to delve into the mind of the artist that redefined the world of video art from the tender of age of eight. After a long absence in which Ralph hasn't produced any video art, a voice from the past sets things in motion that will change Ralph's life.
