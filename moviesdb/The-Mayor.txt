The Mayor

 The Mayor tells the story of Sam Berger, an 88-year-old tailchaser from Brooklyn living it up in a retirement community in Texas. As the local gossip wheel and a mini-celebrity in the community, Sam is known as "the Mayor" because of his charisma, care, and charm. When his latest romance hits the rocks, the Mayor shows how old age can be as alive a time in one's life as any other!
