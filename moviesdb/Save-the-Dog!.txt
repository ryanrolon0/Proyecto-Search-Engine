Save the Dog!

 Becky wants to become an actress. After an audition for a dog food ad she has best chances to get the part - but the day after her dog Petey becomes very ill. She has to come up with $700 until 5 pm for the operation - else Petey will be put to death! Lacking only $70, she takes a job as messenger. She needs only one delivery, but her car breaks down and bad luck delays her again, and again, and again...
