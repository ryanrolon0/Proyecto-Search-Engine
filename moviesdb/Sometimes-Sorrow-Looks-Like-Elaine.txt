Sometimes Sorrow Looks Like Elaine

 Elaine digs up her parents' past in the bed of her father's former lover -- a bisexual man. Her mother's pregnancy with her broke up the men's relationship. Elaine hopes to shed light on the bad marriage by exchanging her body for the facts her parents refuse to share, a perverse martyrdom that's killing her day by day.
