The Irish Gringo

 A half Mexican, half Irish gunman called The Irish Gringo and his pals come across a little girl wandering in the desert. It turns out her grandfather was murdered by a gang looking for the Lost Dutchman mine, a map of which is drawn on the shirt she is wearing, and now the outlaws are after her.
