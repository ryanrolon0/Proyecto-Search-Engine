Screw It, I'll Play Make Believe

 For some it's a cathartic release, and for others a means of escape, but for everyone who chooses to commit the time and expenses of doing it, Live-Action Role-Playing is addictive fun that allows fully grown adults to engage in the magical realm of make-believe-- a place that, as we all age, becomes increasingly less accessible. Filmmaker Briana Young immerses herself in two entirely different live gaming experiences to offer us a playful look at the people involved and why they do it.
