Uncertain, TX

 Two drifters take shelter in a bed and breakfast owned by an elderly blind couple and their mentally challenged (but physically imposing) son in the bayou town of Uncertain, TX. Convinced of the identities of their new guests, the elderly B&B owners play a methodical set of psychological games on the drifters resulting in a twisted, tragic end worthy of the town's name.
