The Law and Jake Wade

 Outlaw Clint Hollister escapes from jail with the help of Marshal Jake Wade, because once Clint did the same for him. Jake left Clint just after, but Clint finds him back and forces Jake to lead him to a loot Jake buried one year ago when he quitted Clint's gang. Jake Wade breaks Cling Hollister out of jail to pay off an old debt, though it's clear there is some pretty deep hostility between them. They part, and Jake returns to his small-town marshal's job and his fiancEe only to find he has been tracked there by Hollister. It seems they were once in a gang together and Jake knows where the proceeds of a bank hold-up are hidden. Hollister and his sidekicks make off into the hills, taking along the trussed-up marshal and his kidnapped bride-to-be to force the lawman to show them where the loot is. Jake Wade is a one-time outlaw who has gone straight and is now the Marshall in a small town. His past catches up with him when his former partner, Clint Hollister, takes him prisoner in order to get his share of the loot from their last job together. To make sure Jake cooperates, they also take his fiancEe Peggy along for the trip. Peggy learns all too quickly about Jake's past. When they reach the ghost town where Jake hid the money, they have to fight off a band of marauding Indians.
