Two Guys Talkin' About Girls

 When longtime friends Joey Fortone and Lenny Kaminski get together, the race is on to get one up on the other. Their fantasies abound and their results lag far behind. In the tradition of "Diner," a mostly dialogue-oriented guys' comedy about two Long Island yuppie buddies named Lenny and Joey. Lenny's a timid romantic. Joey's a womanizing stud. So, when Lenny meets a new girl and thinks she might be the one, Joey takes it upon himself to prove to Lenny once and for all that his philosophy is right.
