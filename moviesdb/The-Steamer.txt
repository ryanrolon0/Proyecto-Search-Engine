The Steamer

 At the beginning of the twentieth century a new form of firefighting was introduced with the advent of the horse-drawn steam fire engine. This revolutionary technology gave firefighters the ability to pump thousands of gallons of water on a fire with a minimal crew, this changed everything. As the Industrial Revolution continued and the advances of the internal combustion engine became commonplace, the need for horse drawn vehicles became obsolete and the romantic era of the Steamer faded away. This documentary is about the discovery, resurrection and restoration of a 1902 American Steam Fire Engine. In 1991, recessed in the shadows of an old barn in Fallbrook, CA, one of these Steamers were rescued. The journey that followed is inspirational and amazing. From some of the most unlikely sources, piece by piece, this American Icon was brought back to life. Today, the Steamer represents the best of us... the best of America.
