The Charlottesville Kitchen Killers

 Against the background of Charlottesville, Virginia, two kitchens, each led by a psychotic brother and staffed by psychotic crews, are trying to obtain a secret recipe for pasta sauce that lies in the mind of the brothers' dying (?) mother. Egged on by a femme fatale playing Lady Macbeth to each, the brothers begin campaigns of elimination ( murder ) against each other, luring and kidnapping each other's crews and slaughtering them in their kitchens.
