The Proud Family Movie

 When Penny and her family are invited on a cruise ship, they learn it's a plot by the evil Dr. Carver (Hall) who wants Oscar's secret to his new Proud Snack. Since Oscar won't reveal, Dr. Carver sends peanut-shaped clones of Penny, Oscar, Trudy, Bebe & Cece, Suga Mama, Bobby, and Puff to wreak havoc back home.
