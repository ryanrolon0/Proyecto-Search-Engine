The End of the Nancy J

 Bill Cluney is the owner of the Nancy J, a fishing boat, and it seemed that everything that could be wrong with a boat was wrong with her. What's more, the local undertaker, always with an eye for business, knew it too. This film goes to show that the time to look after repairs and maintenance is before trouble sets in.
