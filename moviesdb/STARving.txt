STARving

 STARving is an intimate narrative about the world of female students at a performing arts high school. As our protagonist, Sam, succumbs to the pressure to be skinny, she descends into a world of compulsion where help seems out of reach. Drawn from real stories of young actresses with body issues, STARving hopes to raise awareness about the struggles many young women face and stresses the powerful role those around them can play. Modern America is obsessed with body image. For young women, especially in Hollywood, the difference between shining through and fading away is the people who support them.
