Warriors of Toil

 The story of indentured laborers brought to Fiji and their fight for equality, leading to Indian and Fijian problems today (with 4 coups in less than 19 years) and changing the landscape of Fiji forever. The Forgotten Girmitiyas will tell the story of the Indian indentured laborers first brought to Fiji from India by British colonists in 1879. We will investigate the lives of these indentured laborers and attempt to show how their presence in Fiji changed the cultural landscape of Fiji forever.
