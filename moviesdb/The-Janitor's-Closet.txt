The Janitor's Closet

 The Janitor's Closet is a slice-of-life drama about a blue-collar family from Bridgeport, Chicago. The film takes place over the course of a day, the night after a domestic dispute. We follow each character through their daily routines, as they contemplate the state of their lives. The family reconvenes for dinner and their home life is temporarily restored; nothing changes but the family goes on. The film draws no conclusions but mediates on the essence of family and the conundrum of a polluted family structure.
