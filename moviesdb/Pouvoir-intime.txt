Pouvoir intime

 A government ministry's fast-rising head of security asks a shadowy fixer, Meursault, to steal a bag from an armored truck. Meursault goes to ThEo, a former night club owner, in prison for two years on false charges, who's being released in exchange for information about Montreal's underworld. ThEo agrees to steal the bag for money and safe passage to the US for himself and his son Robin. ThEo brings in two helpers, Gilder, ex-con and set designer, and Roxanne, Gilder's friend, a tough-minded petty thief. Their elaborate plan blows up when a guard, Marcel, takes his responsibilities too seriously. What happens to father and son? Will any of the thieves escape?
