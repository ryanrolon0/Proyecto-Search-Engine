The Dinner Guest

 Do you have an affinity for dark comedies and argyle sweaters? Do you often find yourself laughing at inappropriate situations because you see the humorous ironies that lie beyond the scope of most uptight individuals? If you loved Pleasantville but thought combining that idea with Dead Alive would have been a riot then sink your teeth into this film. Bring your bib because this is a playful and bloody little dish.
