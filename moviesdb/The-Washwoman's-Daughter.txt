The Washwoman's Daughter

 "The washwoman's daughter would rather sit by the stove reading a French novel than help her mother. A visitor comes in and protests against the old lady's allowing such a lazy girl about the house. The criticism is not received with good favor, and a quarrel ensues which ends in a lively fracas."
