This End Up

 In the fall of 2007, McMurphy & Sons joined forces with a low budget local network, Tri-State channel 23, to depict their trials and tribulations against their mighty competitor...Mov-a-tron. ...This is their story This End Up has characters which comprise the full spectrum of people, ones we can all identify with. The Boss - who is more interested in carousing than working on himself or his business; the Woman in a Man's World (the moving business) - who is a lesbian and feels unappreciated; the Slacker - who uses his religion as an excuse to perform far more nefarious affairs; and lastly the Silent Worker - who never speaks, what is his story? These characters will go through growth and change, and also play on the viewers preconceived notions. By the end, the 'funny man' may not be so funny, the bigot may realize his failures, the unappreciated may have to find worth within herself, and the man with no voice may find it. A tongue-in-cheek look at the absurdity of modern day reality TV and the clichEs they are known for.
