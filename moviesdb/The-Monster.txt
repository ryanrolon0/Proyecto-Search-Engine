The Monster

 The Monster examines and plays with gender and character roles in horror films. It uses generally accepted shorthand for commonly similar characters and uses it against the viewer. It is an invitation to think twice about who or what we are looking at instead of placing events and people into stereotypes. Things are not what they appear.
