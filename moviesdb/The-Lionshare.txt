The Lionshare

 Nick gets his girls the same way he gets his music date, Eva invites him to an exclusive file-sharing community called 'The Lionshare'. From there, Nick's own creative frustration fuels his consumption of pirated music and other media while he produces nothing of his own. Eventually, he finds inspiration in the unlikeliest of places.
