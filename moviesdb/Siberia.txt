Siberia

 'Siberia' is a first-hand account of a collision between the Siberian oil-gas frontier, a remote Indigenous community, and a film crew. It is a story of love, loss and grim hope remembered through hundreds of still photos taken in the early 1990s, shortly after reforms of glasnost and perestroika.
