The Lost Colony

 The short documentary reveals the life of a family in Crusoe Island, a secluded community in the Green Swamp of North Carolina known for its suspicion of outsiders and subsistence living along the Waccamaw River. Because of the centuries-old isolation of the community, the residents have developed their own unique lifestyle and (nearly intelligible) dialect - quite similar situation as one would find in the 'hollers' of mountainous regions of the eastern part of the United States.
