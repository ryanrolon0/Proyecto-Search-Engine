RKO Screenliner

 Narrator Andre Baruch invites the audience to watch a radio disc jockey at work, and then introduces 13-year-old Molly Bee, a new recording star. Bee is interviewed by Baruch and sings "Everybody's Lonesome for Somebody Else", "It's Really Us Kids Who Have To Pay" and "Tennessee Tango."
