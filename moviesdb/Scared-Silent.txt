Scared Silent

 When the newlywed wife of a Minnesota police chief accuses a new officer on his force of raping her several years earlier, it sets the stage for a tense confrontation in this riveting story. Penelope Ann Miller and Reed Diamond star as Kathy and Doug Clifson, a hard-working couple whose lives are torn apart when a new officer, John McCrane, joins the force. Kathy recognizes him as the man who raped her when she was a teenager, and while other women soon come forward saying that McCrane also raped them, the police force closes ranks to protect one of their own.
