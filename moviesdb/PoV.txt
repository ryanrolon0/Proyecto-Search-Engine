PoV

 POV is a short film that lets the viewer make up their own version of events based on what they see. POV is a conceptual short film designed to provoke thought on the subject of the presentation of film narrative and to use it where and how it has not been used before by telling most of its story through a credit roller. In POV we are presented with the closing scenes of what seems to be a feature length film. This sequence works as it would in any normal film evoking tension, suspense, mystery, empathy and most importantly curiosity. It deliberately leaves the viewer with many unanswered questions.
