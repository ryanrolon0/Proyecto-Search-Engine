The Ghost of Folly

 The old Wilins house is deserted and a pair of crooks, posing as real-estate agents, have no wish that it be sold, since it serves their purposes just as it is. To discourage prospective buyers, they rig the house and make it appear to be haunted and have more than its share of ghosts. Little Alice isn't fooled.
