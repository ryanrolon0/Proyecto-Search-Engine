Robin Williams

 In this comedy special taped at DAR Constitution Hall, his first solo special on the network in seven years, Williams covers such topics global warming, sex and politics, the state of health care in the country (suggesting a cash for clunkers program for elderly relatives, among other things), drugs - recreational and otherwise - and more personal topics, including his recent heart surgery.
