Trouble with the Washerwoman

 A woman is first seen at the tub, washing, when the typical iceman enters, drops a large cake of the frozen moisture into the chest, breaking many of the dishes, and upsetting the eatables whereupon he is scolded by the washerwoman. He then seeks to amuse himself by dropping a piece of ice down the woman's back, which she resents with a blow from a bunch of wet linen. He then thrusts his arm around her neck, and attempts to kiss her. In the scuffle which ensues the tub is overthrown and the water and the suds flood the floor, running toward the audience.
