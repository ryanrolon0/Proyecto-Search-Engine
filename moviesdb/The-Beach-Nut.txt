The Beach Nut

 A crowd gathers at the beach to witness vacationer Wally Walrus thrashing Woody Woodpecker. Wally explains, in flashback, why he is trying to rid himself of Woody... it seems he went to the beach for his day off and, unfortunately, the obnoxious woodpecker had the same idea disrupting Wally's peace and quiet with his antics, even disguising himself as a swami to fool Wally into "finding" him. Back to the present, Wally concludes his story and hurls Woody into the ocean but not without bringing the entire dock down with him, sending Wally and the crowd into the drink themselves! Wally Walrus enjoys the beach on his day off until a rude pest by the name of Woody Woodpecker spoils his vacation. Woody steps on the walrus as he sleeps buried in the sand. He knocks his face into a cake as he tries to eat his picnic lunch. He even starts an illegal fire and throws a match in Wally's direction, burning up the poor Swede's umbrella and chair. Wally has had enough. He gives chase and soon runs into a yogi. It's Woody, of course; and he uses the disguise to torment Wally all the more. It all leads to Wally throttling Woody on the amusement pier, where he tells the gathering crowd the entire story.
