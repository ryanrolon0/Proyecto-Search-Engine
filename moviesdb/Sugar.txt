Sugar

 What started out as a photography project to experiment developing film using coffee (aka Caffenol method) morphed into a 9 month animation production. The filmmakers developed a story that could be told in their respective locations -James in California and Juli in Arkansas. The idea began with James' recently pulled wisdom teeth and the coffee that would ultimately be used to develop the film. The footage was shot both in California and Arkansas, as well as several states along I-40 while the two traveled from one site to another. All the images were created using a 35mm SLR camera; actors and objects were animated frame by frame to tell the simple story of a girl with a toothache. Each roll of film underwent coffee development and hand processing which is what gives the film its sepia-tinted imperfect look. The images with all their stains and scratches were digitally scanned and the hand-drawn elements were added in the editing process. By exploring old film techniques and adopting a DIY attitude, the filmmakers hope to preserve the organic magic of working with film stock as well as encourage a more tactile approach to creating unique imagery.
