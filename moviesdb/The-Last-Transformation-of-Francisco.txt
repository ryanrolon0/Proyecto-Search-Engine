The Last Transformation of Francisco

 Several transvestites have recently turned up dead in the small community of Ocean Crest. Francisco, a Mexican-American single father with a 6 and 10 year old, secretly transforms himself into a transvestite and propositions men at a local park. John, a 'happily' married retired military man becomes Francisco's first client. When the two come face to face, an unexpected event will reveal the true identities of each.
