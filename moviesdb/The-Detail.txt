The Detail

 After seeing the hostage rescue efforts of private detective/security man Beck, a wealthy horse farmer hires Beck to provide a security detail for his daughter, who has received a kidnapping threat. The detail is ambushed, and Beck is wounded. With the aid of some inner-city orphans and their nurse friend, Beck is able to track down the kidnappers, assemble a team of crack commandos, and launch a daring rescue.
