Summerhill

 In an era of general chaos in educational systems worldwide, this against-all-odds story bring up important issues such as the value of a good education, how raising children in a tolerant, accepting and empowering environment leads to healthy adults with a strong sense of justice and how when children are self-motivated instead of being forced to learn, they do so much quicker. The students at England's only free school, Summerhill, legislate their own laws, manage their own bank and are free to decide whether or not to go to class. So when the British government threatens to shut the school down, the students defend their institution, going up against no less than Parliament in the process. The courts ruled in a landmark decision to keep the school open, demonstrating how affective the school really is. SUMMERHILL is a story about freedom extraordinary school community which is run as much by the students as by the staff proves that there is a place for real democracy and respect in the educational world.
