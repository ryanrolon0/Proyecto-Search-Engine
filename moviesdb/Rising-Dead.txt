Rising Dead

 War breaks out worldwide. In desperation world leaders engage Biological weapons, which quickly mutate and cause the dead to rise. The epidemic spreads faster that any one could imagine. The only safe place for the few remaining humans to survive is a nuclear fallout shelter, but getting there is the problem. A Special Forces agent is assigned to escort America's leaders to the location, but the plane crashes a few miles short of their destination. Caught in a tropical setting, those that survive are pitted against hordes of flesh eating zombies. A battle ensues, but when the end is near will humanity prevail, or will mankind fall to the rising dead?
