The Third Society

 After witnessing her parents (who were also federal agents) being murdered by drug kingpin Dragon, Alexandra Jones is hidden away in the jungles of Thailand by the U.S. government. Growing up there, she learns the art of Muay Thai kickboxing before returning to America and joining the LAPD. Still burning for revenge, she vows to hunt down Dragon and put his drug smuggling operation out of business for good.
