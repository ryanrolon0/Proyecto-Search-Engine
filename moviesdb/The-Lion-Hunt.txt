The Lion Hunt

 The talking magpies go to Africa to indulge in a bit of lion-hunting and, once there, they find a lion who has no desire to be hunted by two wise-cracking birds. Heckle almost meets his maker when Jeckle persuades him to serve as lion bait. The lion is deceived for a little while when they promise him a movie contract but the end finds the score about dead-even between the hunters and the huntee.
