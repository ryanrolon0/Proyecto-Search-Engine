Soulmate

 SOULMATE(DOT)WED is a romantic comedy about a successful dating service, which promises "not just a date, but a mate." However, trouble brews when clients aren't getting married as advertised. The interactions of the wacky staff with the wacky clients as the staff desperately tries to live up to the company's promises make for a delightful, rib-tickling adventure with romance around every corner.
