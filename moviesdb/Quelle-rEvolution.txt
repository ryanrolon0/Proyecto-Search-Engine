 The assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on February 14 2005 triggered what came to be seen as a "revolution" in Lebanon. The Lebanese people congregated in downtown Beirut in a series of demonstrations and even set up a protest camp in the area demanding political change and declaring national solidarity. The climax of the "revolution" was on April 13 2005, the 30th anniversary of the Lebanese Civil War. For the first time since the end of the war in 1990, it was commemorated by the Lebanese people, who were propelled by their new-found zeal for national unity. The film offers a critical view of the "revolution". Starting with the jubilation of the Lebanese as they paraded in downtown Beirut declaring their nationalism and reflecting on the greatness of the "revolution", the film moves on to show how national unity soon became no more than the latest fashion sale in the name of national unity, from food to handbags to make up. The Lebanese flag became the motif through which all products were marketed. The film laments the way national unity was sold like cigarettes, and illustrates what happens when the latest fashion is no longer "in" after the celebrations of April 13, downtown Beirut was suddenly deserted. The spaces that had been full of people for the past two months were abandoned, and only the Lebanese flags were left flapping in the wind.
