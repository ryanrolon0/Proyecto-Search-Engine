The Overpass

 An old man whose presence became useless in a modernized city under constant development. A 73 year-old man, Yoo Jungok makes a scanty livelihood by collecting and selling recyclable junks and lives alone under an overpass in Seoul. But as the city is getting urbanized, it becomes harder for him to survive with his low-tech tools and outmoded cart. He spends 3 days collecting junks for getting just 5 dollars with which he cannot feed just himself. One day, after telling his hard-luck story, he sells his old cart and bike and leaves the overpass for returning to his home town.
