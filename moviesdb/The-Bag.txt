The Bag

 Tempation, in the form a nondescript bag, forever changes the lives of six people. A catalyst, in the form of a soft-spoken stranger, follows the bag, moving our characters like pieces on a chess board. They would kill to know what's in The Bag. Once they find out, they'll kill to keep it a secret.
