Shinpi no sekai Eru Hazâdo

 Makoto is a high school student who one day found himself sent to a strange, magical world called El Hazard. He is then forced to impersonate a missing princess(an idea for which he does not care for). Other earthlings sent to this world include Makoto's teacher (Fujisawa), his girlfriend (Nanami), and his girlfriend's brother (Jinnai). Jinnai, by the way has teamed up with an evil army of giant insect creatures so that he can take over El Hazard and kill Makoto. Luckly, Makoto has a guide and a bodygaurd to help him get by. Well actually, the guide is a girl who falls in love with every woman she meets and the bodyguard is just a cat... oh well.
