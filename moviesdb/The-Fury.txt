The Fury

 A secret US agency behind the unscrupulous Childres gathers children with parapsychologic abilities and trains them to become killers in war situations. To rescue his son, who was officially declared dead after an arranged accident, the ex-CIA agent Peter investigates against Childres. Peter Sandza is a secret government agent whose son has extraordinary psychic gifts, which make the young man the target of a kidnapping plot hatched by Peter's duplicitous colleague, Ben Childress. Peter spends eleven months in a desperate search for his son, while cleverly evading Childress, who wants him dead. In that time, Childress and team have done their best to harness the psychic teenager's powers; but giving him luxuries, and even an elegant doctor as a mistress, have only turned him into a mercurial egomaniac with a violent temper. Meanwhile, another teenager with psychic gifts takes part in a two-week study at a psi research center, where she comes to the attention Peter's lover, who also acts as his mole. Childress learns of this young woman, too, and is eager to take control of a second extraordinary talent. Former government agent Peter Sandza, goes head-to-head against old colleague turned bitter adversary Ben Childress, when Childress tries to kill him, and kidnaps his son, the telepathically-gifted Robin. Childress seeks to use Robin's powers to further secret experiments in 'psi' research for weapons applications. Peter's only link to his son is Gillian Bellaver, an equally gifted teen who is tuned in to Robin's powers. Peter and Gillian join forces in a race against time to save Robin from his captors, and also from himself.
