The Good Neighbour

 Max suffers from avoidant personality syndrome. He lives alone in an apartment building in a rough part of town. It is here where he encounters a young girl named Emily who has been left with her Uncle Caesar, a drug dealer and addict. Max soon becomes aware, along with his neighbours, that Caesar is physically abusing Emily. One day, by chance, Max is drawn to help Emily. As Emily's plight draws Max out of his shell, he will be forced to make a decision. His choice sanctuary or finding the courage to help before it's too late. The Good Neighbour is inspired by the tragic true story of the murder of Nia Glassie.
