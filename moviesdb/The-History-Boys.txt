The History Boys

 In 1980s Britain, a group of young men at Cutlers' Grammar School all have the brains, and the will to earn the chance of getting accepted in the finest universities in the nation, Oxford and Cambridge. Despite the fine teaching by excellent professionals like Mrs Lintott in history and the intellectually enthusiastic Hector in General Studies, the Headmaster is not satisfied. He signs on the young Irwin to polish the students' style to give them the best chance. In this mix of intellectualism and creative spirit that guides a rigorous preparation regime for that ultimate educational brass ring, the lives of the randy students and the ostensibly restrained faculty intertwine that would change their lives forever. When a 1980s class achieves the best scores ever at Cutlers' Grammar School for boys in Sheffield (Yorkshire, northern England), the petty headmaster, who craves the prestige like the parents, recruits a young Oxford graduate, Irwin, to prepare them for the general entry exams for the world class universities of Oxford and Cambridge. He stresses that takes not just delivering what all schools prepare for, but -if they even really want to go- standing out by a different approach and perspective quotations and associations, the other side of the coin, witty phrasing... Actually good foundations were laid by the current staff, less by history teacher Dorothy Lintott, a frustrated liberal feminist without actual impact, then by the enthusiasm-arousing 'Hector' in General Studies, who gets their attention and makes them think trough literature, open discussion, role-play and performing declamation and song, at both of which the only Jewish (like the Muslim, fully integrated) boy, sensitive gentle gay David, excels. Alas, when the headmaster learns that the caring, paternal Hector once innocently touched a boy's privates, he insists on 'graceful' early retirement, a personal drama with surprising twists in the end. Meanwhile the irresistible class flirt, Dakin, skilfully tests all borders including his and Irwin's sexual orientation, and all consider what they really aspire and care for, in studies and life.
