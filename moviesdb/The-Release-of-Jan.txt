The Release of Jan

 Released from prison after a lengthy, commuted sentence, Jan Beran is returned to the life he left behind as a much younger man. His exuberance is matched by the girlfriend who waited for him and the friends who welcome him back with open arms. But nothings ever so simple. In order for Jan to move forward, he must reconcile the time he lost with what little time he still has left.
