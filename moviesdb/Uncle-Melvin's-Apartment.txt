Uncle Melvin's Apartment

 Danny, a germaphobe from Chicago, travels to New York to meet with publishers about his new novel. A rejection, a fall and a broken leg land him in the care of his scam-artist Uncle who he hasn't seen in almost 10 years. It's also been about that long since his Uncle Melvin's apartment has last been cleaned.
