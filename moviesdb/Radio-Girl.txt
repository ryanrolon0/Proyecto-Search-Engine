Radio Girl

 The film begins with a descent into a surreal underground world where Radio Girl and her charming beau (Vickers Gringo) are sitting down to a romantic dinner. Cartoon violence and madcap misfortune follows as the couple along with their spastic waiter (played by Noble Robinette) entertain us through this live action cartoon - scored by Stephen Coates of The Real Tuesday Weld and inspired by the bands music, the film is an homage to classic hyperactive cartoons of the 1930s.
