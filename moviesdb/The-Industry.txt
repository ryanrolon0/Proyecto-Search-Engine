The Industry

 A documentary film crew captures the humorous, raunchy and surprisingly candid innards of a dysfunctional adult film production. With an ensemble cast of misfit actors in tow, the clueless and self absorbed director, Milo (Stephen Sorrentino), has brought his best friend, the unscrupulously slimy veteran adult film star Johnny Vegas (Bruce Hammond), out of retirement for one last chance at winning the adult film industry's best picture award. But before Milo can bring home the coveted Golden Woody that has eluded him his whole career, he must endure incompetence during the production of what he feels should be his crowning masterpiece. A "mockumentary" comedy short about a dysfunctional adult film production. The film's Director Milo must endure the dysfunction of crew and cast before he can achieve his ultimate goal which is to win the adult film industry's coveted Golden Woody Award.
