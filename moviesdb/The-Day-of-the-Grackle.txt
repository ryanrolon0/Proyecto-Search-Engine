The Day of the Grackle

 When a large, territorial bird, known as a Grackle, invades a man's life, his docile existence is turned upside down. The man sets a fatal trap for the bird, which not only fails but also is the first push of the dominoes that sets in motion a battle between man and beast. The action escalates into a full-on war, culminating in the transformation of our man's life to a destiny far beyond his wildest dreams.
