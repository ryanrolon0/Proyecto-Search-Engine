Stigmata

 Spanning the globe in search of living stigmatics. With the help of doctors, scientists and skeptics they examine the cases of several stigmatics including an American girl, Audrey Santos, in a coma, and an Italian man named Albino Reale. Never before seen analysis seeks to determine once and for all whether these "stigmatics" are the result of "heavenly" forces, or something much darker.
