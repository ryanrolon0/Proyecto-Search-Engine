Studio Stoops

 The stooges are hired by a movie studio as publicity men. Their first assignment is to get publicity for Dolly Devore, a pretty starlet. They fake a kidnapping, but the cops won't believe their story. Then the girl is really kidnapped and the stooges must come to the rescue. Shemp winds up hanging out a tenth story window on an extending telephone.
