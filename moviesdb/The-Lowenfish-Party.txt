The Lowenfish Party

 For the graduating Senior Class, The Lowenfish Party was supposed to be one final hurrah with their high school friends. But when the cops raid the out-of-control party, it's a mad dash of teens rushing from the house. Now separated from their "real" friends, six teens from different cliques are forced to spend the night together and face their differences. They've shared the cafeteria, the gym, and the school halls for 12 years -- and never even wanted to know each other. But when the party of the year turns out to be a cop-raided bust, six high school seniors are forced to band together and face their differences.
