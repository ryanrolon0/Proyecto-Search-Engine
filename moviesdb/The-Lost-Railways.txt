 A combination of archive film and modern-day video of British railway lines which have closed since the 1950s. The railways which are featured include Somerset and Dorset Line, Bluebell Line, Waverley Route, Stainmore Line, Settle and Carlisle Line, Woodhead Line and Great Central Line. There is also a 5-minute extra film about the disappearing rural freight network.
