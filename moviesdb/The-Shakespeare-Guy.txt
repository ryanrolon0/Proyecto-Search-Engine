The Shakespeare Guy

 A monologue transformed into a comedic study in Characterization and atmosphere, made using Lisa Dalton's Michael Chekhov Connection Actors. The central character speaks in his own archaic language, living in his own little world, expecting everyone around him to accept his unusual communications. When he walks in on his wayward wife and her tennis pro in the midst of a lewd affair, his shock is too deep for him to comprehend. Throwing both of the half-dressed scoundrels out of the house, he visits his psychiatrist in search for relief from his Hamlet-like melancholy. Despite the impenetrable doctor's lack of compassion, the Shakespeare Guy finds relief, forgiveness and even euphoria. He goes to celebrate a with a latte, absorbing life anew and delighting in the cacophony of characters in the glorious spring day. Mixed in amongst the masses in the coffee plaza is the psychiatrist, the tennis pro and a repentant mis-dressed Mrs. Shakespeare Guy.
