Walking with Freedom

 ...it captures the experience and the adventures, pain, joy and interactions of Michael Daniel as he traverses the Eastern Seaboard on foot along the 2173 mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. From snow, to rain, to blood and tears, to the final summit of Mount Katahdin in Maine, it is a music filled epic of the beauty of the human spirit, and the subculture who take this long walk.
