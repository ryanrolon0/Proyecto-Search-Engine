Small Town Silver Screen

 This documentary film tells the story of historic, small-town theaters, their owners and their movie-goers in rural South Dakota. It focuses on the theaters' origins and closings, the theaters' revival by community members and volunteer support as they struggle to survive the competition from distant, large city stadium theaters.
