Tant qu'on a la santE

 The director's cut (restored version) opens and closes with theatrical curtains in homage to Georges MEliEs films, and is divided into four parts, separated by title cards about vampires until sunrise, when his wife finally wakes up and reveals her true nature]; II - Le cinEmatographe [unlike 1895, employees leaving the factory, or the office, are a much eventful thing, and finding a sit in a crowded cinema is quite a task]; III - Tant qu'on a la santE [in modern times, everyone suffers of stress, and the psychiatrist most of all other people]; IV - Nous n'irons plus au bois [a week-end hunter, a couple out for a pic-nic, and a farmer setting a wire fence find that a large wood is not large enough to accommodate them all].
