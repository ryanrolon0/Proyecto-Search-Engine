Something About Ryan

 "Something About Ryan" chronicles the misadventures of Ryan Nuzzolo, a live-at-home slacker from Staten Island, who doesn't want to grow up and move out of his parent's house. Ryan's lifestyle includes hanging in front of the TV, attending a community college, and partying all the time with his best friend and neighbor, Anthony. The problem is that Ryan doesn't look for trouble-it has a habit of finding him.
