 This film deals with the War Orphans following WWII at a children's village in the Swiss Alps where over 200 orphans from all parts of Europe are gathered. The subplots involve a romance betwwen two of the teachers, the grim decision of Red Poland to quit the experiment, and the problem of the German children being viewed as symbols of opression rather than as the same victims as the childfren from other countries. The last credit line is for the Teachers and Children of Pestalozzi Village.
