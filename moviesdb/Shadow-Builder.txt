Shadow Builder

 An evil Archbishop of the Catholic Church summons a demon to try and destroy the world. The summoners are killed, but the demon escapes to hunt down its needed victim. The victim soon turns out to be a child that has the potential to become a saint. After ravaging the town and turning its citizens upon themselves, the demon soon locates and captures his prey. A cult of followers of the evil Shadowbuilder summons the demon using the picture of the son of the scumbag Vic Lambert. The group is surprised by Father Vassey that kills the followers but Shadowbuilder escapes to Grand River, a town that will experience an eclipse on the next day. Father Vassey heads to the town and discovers that the demon's target is Chris Hatcher, a boy that caused an stigmata in the image of Christ in his baptism that is raised by his aunt Jenny. Shadowbuilder brings chaos to Grand River to collect souls and becomes power. Meanwhile, Father Vassey teams up with the local Sheriff Sam Logan that is Jenny's boyfriend and together they try to protect Chris and destroy the powerful demon.
