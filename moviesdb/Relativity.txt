Relativity

 The filmmaker¹s encounter, at the age of 30, with her biological mother is the springboard for a humourous and bittersweet journey past biology to other alternative notions of destiny. Her family of origin is opposite to her experience and the difference shakes her to her foundation. Left waiting to meet her biological father and sister, the filmmaker tries to sort through the opposites of rural versus urban, Christian versus atheist, and legitimacy versus illegitimacy. Funny and painful by turns, the film is part coming of age and part detective story as it slides effortlessly from personal perspective to universal ideas. Not just an adoption story, Relativity breaks into ideas of separateness and kinship, identity and experience, to arrive at the meaning and mystery of belonging.
