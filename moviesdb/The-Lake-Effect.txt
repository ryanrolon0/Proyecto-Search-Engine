The Lake Effect

 A freak warm snap kills the brothers' lot full of Christmas trees and, with it, Charlie's latest get-rich-quick scheme. After a lifetime of bailing out his brother, Duncan is now given an ultimatum by his fiancEe Amy, who has had enough. Will Charlie (and his cohort, the "Christmas Clown") manage to keep hold of the only one among them with any promise, or will Duncan finally choose his own road to happiness, and leave his brother to wallow in the latest mess of his own making?
