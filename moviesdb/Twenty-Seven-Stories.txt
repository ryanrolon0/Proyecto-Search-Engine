Twenty-Seven Stories

 Short documentary. Fly-on-the-wall observation of a competition. You have two minutes to capture the American Dream. Watch teams from around the world compete in the Wake Forest University Graduate Business School Elevator Competition. Participants pitch start-up business ideas to venture capitalist in moving elevators (from floor #1 to floor #27). One team is followed throughout the film. Could you pitch your dream in two minutes? The style is direct-cinema, similar to "Salesman" by the Maysles Brothers, "Titicut Follies" by Frederick Wiseman, and "Don't Look Back" by D.A. Pennebaker.
