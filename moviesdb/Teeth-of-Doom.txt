Teeth of Doom

 Two zombies are close on the trail of the blonde girl. Just as they're about to render unspeakable horrors upon her, the dinner bell sounds "Dinner is now being served for all supernatural residents." The blonde stands up, puts on her Nurse's hat, hands the zombies back their dentures and they all hobble off to eat. The zombies have a walker and a cane. Hilarious!
