Songs for the City of Angels

 The World Festival of Sacred Music provided a means for the public to cross boundaries of race, class, and religion to promote a collective definition of Los Angeles. The festival also brought together international performing groups from Indonesia, New Caledonia, and Taiwan. The documentary follows each of these three groups throughout the festival - as they arrive, meet, rehearse, and perform with local Los Angeles artists. The documentary gives voice to the best intentions of the participants in the festival balanced by an exploration of the human effort and community commitment it requires.
