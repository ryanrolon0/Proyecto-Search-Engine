 Hoppy goes to town to help Marshal Windy with some rustlers and winds up helping the widow Joyce when confidence men try to take her herd. King's Men songs include Town Marshal "Windy" Halliday sends for his old Bar-20 Ranch friends, "Hopalong" Cassidy and "Lucky" Jenkins, to help fight a gang of outlaws led by "Stiff-Hat" Bailey. Cassidy becomes interested in Mary Joyce, whose ranch is the main target of the Bailey gang. Things are complicated by the fact that Mary's husband, "Rusty" Joslin, and escaped convict, is tied up with the outlaws. Hoppy and Lucky arrive to see their old friend Windy. At the same time prison escapee Joslin also arrives. He is the supposedly dead husband of Mary Joyce and he brings in outlaws planning to rustle her cattle. When Hoppy exposes him as an outlaw, Mary persuades Hoppy not to arrest him. So Joslin and his gang then go after her cattle.
