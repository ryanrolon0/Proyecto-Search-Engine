The Man on the Porch

 The Earth is an old, sick, grumpy and tired old man. The Moon, a beautiful and cheerful young woman. The Moon constantly tries to tell jokes to the Earth in order to cheer him up, but since he is very sick it is a difficult task. She will eventually get him to finally tell a joke. A joke about an old man on a porch, a joke not necessarily very funny.
