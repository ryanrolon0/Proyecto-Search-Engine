The Avengers

 The Avengers (1961 -1969)and London go hand in hand. In the 1960s London had style, verve and appeal. London became a vivid backdrop to the adventures of John Steed, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King. In "THE AVENGERS - Wish You Were Here? The Top Ten London Locations" we've decided to take a look at some of the most popular London locations featured in the series with then and now reconstructed shots.
