So Happy Together

 A dark comedy about Brian Hanley, a hard-working, uptight twenty-three year-old medical school applicant who becomes convinced that his happy-go-lucky yet slovenly roommate Neil is secretly a devious criminal mastermind, trying to ruin his life. Is mild-mannered Neil really up to no-good, or has Brian just cracked under the pressure of being on a Med. School wait list?
