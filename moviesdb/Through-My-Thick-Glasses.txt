Through My Thick Glasses

 On a snowy day in Oslo, a grandfather gets his young granddaughter ready to go outside. She wears thick glasses and stares silently at him. As he puts her cap on her, he tells the story of how he came to Oslo as a lad during World War II, orphaned in the countryside when the Germans tried to capture his parents and he went to live with his aunt. She's a formidable woman, full of surprises as the lad tries to join the resistance, plans to leave for England to join the fight, and finds himself arrested. Grandfather's story continues through the end of the war. Who's his audience? An elderly Norwegian bundles up his granddaughter before sending her out to play in the snow, but she refuses to wear the cap. Grandma suggests telling her an exciting story in order to get her cooperation, so Grandpa relates the story of his youth in Nazi occupied Norway and of his repeated attempts to join the resistance. With his parents in hiding he was raised by his widowed aunt, an amazing woman who manages to protect him from the Nazis and himself during the war. Although the little girl seems more baffled than entertained by Grandpa's tale, he might just have the right ending to convince her to wear her cap out into the cold.
