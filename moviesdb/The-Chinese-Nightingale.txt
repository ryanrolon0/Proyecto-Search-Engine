The Chinese Nightingale

 A Chinese emperor is gladdened by the song of the nightingale and is moved to play his own song. One day, the Japanese send a music box with a mechanical bird; the nightingale feels rejected and leaves. But soon, the clockwork breaks down, and the emperor dispatches his crow to go look; meanwhile, the emperor grows sicker with the passing months.
