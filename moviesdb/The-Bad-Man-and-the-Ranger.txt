The Bad Man and the Ranger

 Jim Hickey, bad man, insulted pretty Rosalyn Perkins by helping himself to several kisses. Rosalyn told her father, a rigid Southern gentleman who still believed in the duello, and who promptly arranged a duel between Bob Blackburn, her lover, and Jim Hickey. This novel proposition amused Jim. On the battle-ground, Perkins slipped a blank into Jim's gun and a bullet into Bob's. Of Course, Bob didn't fire, but Jim did. A week later, Bob, appointed deputy sheriff, went in search of Jim and his pals. But Jim caught Bob--then, recognizing Bob as the charitable lover who did not kill him when he had the chance, turned him free.
