The Big Benefit

 A grab-bag of singers and dancers featuring, at the time, New York-based performers such as Rae Sanuels, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, the four Mullen Sisters and the team of Evans & Mayer. Dancers Pops & Louie (Albert Whitman and Louis Williams), later to be seen in Republic's "Hit Parade of 1943", are also along.
