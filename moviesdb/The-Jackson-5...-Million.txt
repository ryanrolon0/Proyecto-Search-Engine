The Jackson 5... Million

 The Jackson 5... Million is a feature documentary directed by Caroline Ledgin, a director who has been dubbed the "MJ fan expert" by multiple media outlets. Have you ever wondered what makes Michael Jackson's fans so devoted? Ever think about how much their passion fuels their actions, and wonder why they support the most famous pop star on the planet? And for that matter, have you ever wondered how MJ himself became such a global phenomenon? All those questions will be answered in this film which gets deeply involved with fans on the most intimate levels. This film was shot mostly at the trial in Santa Maria in 2005 (with additional footage shot in other areas of the U.S. and Europe). Though the trial itself isn't a direct part of the film, the fans' support during the accusations against MJ was the true inspiration behind the film. When Michael Jackson passed away in 2009 literally 2 weeks after the rough cut was finished, additional scenes needed to be shot to accommodate the tragic, untimely death - and, of course, the film's dynamic immediately changed. The film again wrapped production in 2009 and explores the MJ-fan world that so many don't understand. The film exposes the most die-hard, most loyal and devoted fans, and gets into their hearts and minds so the rest of the world can gain a deep understanding of those who have supported Jackson throughout his life.
