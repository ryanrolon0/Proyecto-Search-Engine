Scoutman

 Mary (17) and Atsushi (20) elope and come to live in Tokyo from a nearby city. Soon after running out of money, they start looking for a job. Mari meets a girl named Kana who sells party tickets in the streets. Kana claims she's 18 years old but in actuality she is only 15. Atsushi comes to know a group of young scoutmen and gets hired as one of them. While Marie and Atsushi are encountering with these people, their beliefs and values are shaken.
