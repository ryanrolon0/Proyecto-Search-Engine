Sins of the Father

 Set in 2012, Sins of the Father follows semi-retired "B" movie actor Peter Jacobs as he returns to Fairview Falls to uncover the truth behind the Black Rose Killer - who killed his wife and son years before. This completes the trilogy begun in The Tenement and continued in Fear of the Dark. The movie takes place some 15 years after the events in Fear of the Dark. Peter Jacobs is a well-known B-movie actor who is writing his memoirs. Having never been truly satisfied with the investigation of his wife and son's murders, he returns to Fairview Falls seeking answers. What he ultimately finds is Ethan Fernier aka the Black Rose Killer. Ethan, now in his sixties, is dying. He lives in isolation with his son Alec. What is the truth behind the infamous serial killer? Will Peter find the answers he seeks or will he fall prey to the Black Rose Killer? Some secrets were never meant to be discovered. Some secrets should just stay buried!
