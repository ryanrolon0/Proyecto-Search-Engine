Sid Bernstein Presents...

 Filmed on Super 16 mm film, Sid Bernstein Presents is the story of the man who brought the Beatles to America. But the beauty of the film comes from Sid's own story. An adopted kid from Harlem, Bernstein was a dreamer who worked tirelessly for his clients out of a desire to share his love of music with the world, and his belief in music's power to bring people together. The film's most prominent interviews include a diverse array of stars such as Lenny Kravitz, Shirley MacLaine, Steven Van Zandt, Moody Blues, Paul Anka, Dick Clark, The Rascals, Jerry Vale, Phoebe Snow, The Animals, Herman's Hermits, comedians Red Buttons and Pat Cooper, music titans Ahmet Ertegun, Bruce Lundvall, Woodstock Promoter Michael Lang and more. It also contains the last filmed interview with late Latin great Tito Puente and has a great deal of footage that is rare or has never been seen by the public.
