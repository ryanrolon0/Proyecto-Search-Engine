Pride Against Prejudice

 In 1947, the year Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier, Bill Veeck signed Larry Doby (1923-2003) to the Cleveland Indians. We see interviews with Doby himself, family members, teammates, and baseball historians. The film traces Doby's career from high-school athletics in Paterson, N.J. and being in the Navy during World War II, to playing in the Negro Leagues, breaking into the majors, winning a World Series and playing on All-Star teams, mentoring younger players, becoming a coach and manager, and being elected to the Hall of Fame. The film argues that Doby, Robinson, Veeck, and Branch Rickey's contributions were not just to baseball, but to U.S. history.
