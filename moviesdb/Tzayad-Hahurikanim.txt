Tzayad Hahurikanim

 Sleeping on a mattress beside the main highway into Tel Aviv, rising at nightfall to collect bottles for recycling, Patrick has known better times. Once he was a promising sous chef in a popular restaurant. Now, his life is ruled by alcohol and heroin in a world enthralled with superficial glamor and success, and blind to its casualties. Follow behind the camera's eye, through a circus of the absurd, a society consumed with self, all narrated by one who has seen both sides. With a winter thunderstorm approaching, Patrick, with childish candor, shares with us the dream that keeps him going - to journey to America to become a hurricane hunter. His hope is his salvation.
