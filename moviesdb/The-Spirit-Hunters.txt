The Spirit Hunters

 Filmed within Peru's remote Manu National Park, "The Spirit Hunters" follows the American anthropologist Glenn Shepard as he lives with and learns from the Machiguenga Indians of the Upper Amazon. This isolated tribe, which once had contact with the powerful Inca Empire, believes that all rain forest plants and animals have arisen from their ancestors and thus possess human spirits and souls.
