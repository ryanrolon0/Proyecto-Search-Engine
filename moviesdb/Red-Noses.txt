Apprehensive, but with the promise of a bonus and vacation, the women go. First, they object to undressing, then they have trouble with a mechanical horse and chair. Next it's time for a treadmill. After that disaster, it takes several spa employees to give Thelma and Zazu a massage. When they want to leave, they can't find their clothes; honest mistakes result in chaos. But are they cured?
