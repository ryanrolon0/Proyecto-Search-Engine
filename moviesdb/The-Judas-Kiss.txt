The Judas Kiss

 A writer, an actor and the actor's wife are immersed in a love triangle, set against the backdrop of McCarthy era "blacklisting"; the actor's testimony sends the writer to prison, during which time he writes a play about betrayal, producing it upon his release with the actor starring in the lead role.
