This Is a Photograph

 Snapshot impressions of a European immigrant's first five years in Canada. Revealed are his reactions to his adopted country, to the environment, and Canadian ways to which he must adjust. At first everything seems strange; the red brick houses, the glass skyscrapers, cars everywhere, stores stuffed with consumer goods, but gradually he becomes accustomed to calling the place home.
