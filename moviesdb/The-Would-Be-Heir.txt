The Would-Be Heir

 Alone in the world, with the exception of her worthless cousin, Ethel Rivers had learned to love her foreman, Jack Mason. Her cousin determines to estrange the couple, as Ethel's marriage would conflict with his plan to secure possession of the ranch. He confers with his servant, and together they evolve a plot. He is to simulate an injury, and the servant is to go to Ethel for succour (sic). Then the servant is to entice the foreman to a convenient spot to witness his sweetheart's perfidy. When the servant arrives at the ranch with the washing she feigns great excitement, and tells Ethel that her cousin has broken his leg. Ethel hurries to her cousin to help him, and the servant seeks the foreman and tells him that his sweetheart is false. He prepares to leave the ranch. He bids the boys good-bye, but ignores his sweetheart. As he passes the hut of the servant he hears his name mentioned and that of his sweetheart. The plotters are talking over the success of their plans. Jack rushes at them, and assaults the cousin. He them returns to his sweetheart, and after explanations, joy again reigns supreme in the hearts of the lovers.
