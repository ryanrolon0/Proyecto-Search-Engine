Red Bears and the Last Dreaming

 Red Bears and the Last Dreaming is a surreal fantasy about a man who is constantly haunted by a lady in his waking dream. He sees a psychiatrist hoping to solve the problem. But as he struggles to keep his place in reality, the lady exploits his weaknesses to gain dominance. The film explores the fine line between reality and dreams, in which, we often see dreams as silly escapades and reality as the truth; away from delusions of the fantastic.
