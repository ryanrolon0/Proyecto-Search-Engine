The Newlyweds' Neighbors

 The first entry in the two-reel shorts series based on "The Newlyweds" (later changed to "Snookums") comic strip by George McManus. There is a neighborhood feud when Snookum's throws empty cans into the neighbor's yard. This one features dancing eggs, with the feet sticking out, Snookums getting dizzy on a phonograph turntable, and a trained goose.
