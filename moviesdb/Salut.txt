Salut

 A motorcade of conquering soldiers rolls past a group of villagers, engaged in the mourning of their dead. A commanding officer raises his hand in a familiar salute. The kind from nightmares. One by one the villagers raise their hands in excruciating compliance. Except for one man. A unique and award-winning team combined to deliver SALUT - a powerful, taut visual poem set against the arena of an ageless obsession
