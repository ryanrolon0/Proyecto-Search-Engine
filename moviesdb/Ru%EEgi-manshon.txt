Ruîgi manshon

 Luigi receives a letter one day, informing him he has won a mansion as the grand prize in a contest. Luigi is puzzled; he never entered a contest. But anyway, he tells Mario, and invites him over. When Luigi arrives at his mansion, he discovers that it is haunted with malevolent ghosts and Mario is trapped somewhere inside. Wielding a flashlight and a specialized vacuum called the "Poltergust 3000" he walks through the dark rooms and hallways, exterminating ghosts and searching for his brother.
