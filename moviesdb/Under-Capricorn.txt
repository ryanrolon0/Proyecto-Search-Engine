Henrietta is an alcoholic and seems to be on the verge of madness. Charles Adare arrives in Australia in 1831 with his uncle, the new governor. Unsuccessful in Ireland, Charles hopes to make his fortune in Sydney. He is befriended by Samson Flusky, a prosperous ex-convict. Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta, "Hattie", was a friend of Charles's sister in Ireland. Sam hopes that the young man will be able to cheer up his wife, who is a mentally unstable alcoholic. Meanwhile the attractive housekeeper, Milly, secretly loves Sam, and encourages Hattie's drinking. Sam has been sent to an Australian prison after he confessed to a killing that Hattie actually committed. She had followed him and waited for his release.

This time Hattie accepts the blame for the shooting. Milly, seeing her chances to win Sam slipping away, attempts to poison Hattie.
