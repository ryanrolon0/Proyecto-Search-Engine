The Skisherman

 It's past midnight, forty degrees and raining with a thick fog; Frank Blasko is half a mile off a lonely Montauk NY beach, but he's not in a boat. One of a handful of hardcore fisherman who practice the extreme art of swim fishing called Skishing, Frank's idyllic family life as a doting father and devoted husband stands in harsh contrast to his rough past and hardened demeanor. Alone in the ocean, with only himself to count on and in conditions that send most fisherman home, Frank find peace. A man born at odds with the world, he might just have the last laugh, that is if he doesn't get hit by a boat or eaten by a shark first.
