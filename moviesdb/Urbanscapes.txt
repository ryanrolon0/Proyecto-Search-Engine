Urbanscapes

 A visually stunning documentary about decay and renewal in urban America, Urbanscapes is a portrait of evolution, change, and chaos in four different cities - Chicago, Detroit, New York and Newark - as seen through eyes of residents and artists who have witnessed the dramatic transformation of their neighborhoods. Italian-born husband-and-wife directors Filippo Piscopo and Lorena Luciano use a variety of photographic styles and editing techniques to chronicle decades of physical and social changes in this unique work of cinematic archeology.
