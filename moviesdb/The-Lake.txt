The Lake

 Based on actual events, surrounding one of San Francisco's oldest ghost stories, a tormented soul wanders Golden Gate Park in search of her lost children. Friend or foe, anyone who meets the restless spirit is almost guaranteed certain Death. A group of friends go to the lake to find the truth, but they get more than they bargain for when their paths cross with the woman of Stow Lake.
