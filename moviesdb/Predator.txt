Predator

 In 1930, a Predator is known as the devil of New Way City. However, when a mob boss dies, the city becomes chaotic, and when Predator attempts to escape, he nears death. As a last-chance effort, he self-destructs his ship, hoping to take himself with it. However, although the city is in ruins, the Predator survives, and is sentenced by his species to go into exile. But although the Predator is gone, his technology was left behind. 100 years later, the humans have advanced quickly with the Predator's technology, and the cities are ruled by crime. Now, the Predator returns to Earth in an attempt to right his wrongs. The hunt has begun.
