Southern Heart

 Collin is destined to get a top management position in his family's mining company. He gets a company assignment to buy a piece of land for mining. To avoid causing bad feelings with the town community, the plans are kept a secret. The longer Collin stays in the little town, the more he likes the town and in particular one woman, Tommy. He now has to choose between his work and his heart.
