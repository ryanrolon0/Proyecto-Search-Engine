Spintex

 Filmed at an open-air nightclub and other locations in the Ashanti region of Ghana, Spintex is based on a real-time transition from day to night. In Accra, on the Equator, the transformation from bright sunlight into red, into blue, into the deepest black night lasts only fifteen minutes all year round. On Spintex Road, the air is dusty and humid, loaded with scent and stench. At the dance in an old roofless shell by the beach, throbbing masses are engulfed in trance. The pulsing crowd forms one motion, one being; a rhythmic, sexual and elemental force as brutal as the cycles of the natural world around it.
