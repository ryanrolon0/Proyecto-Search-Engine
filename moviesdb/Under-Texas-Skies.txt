Under Texas Skies

 Stony Brooke returns to his home town only the learn that his father, Sheriff Brooke, has been murdered and that his boyhood friend, Tucson Smith has been convicted and is to hang for the killing. The killing was actually committed by Brooke's deputy Tom Blackton, when he feared that his activities as the secret head of a gang of cattle rustlers and bank robbers was about to be exposed. Blackton has taken over as sheriff. Rancher Jim Marsden helps Tucson escape, and Stony encounters the wounded Tucson and helps him back to his ranch, where Tucson's sister, Helen treats his wounds. When Blackton's posse arrive, Tucson escapes through a trap door and heads for the hills. Blackton convinces Stony of Tucson's guilt, and Stony becomes a deputy with the intent of hunting down his former friend. But he changes his mind when a circuit judge, coming to preside over a new trial for Tucson, is killed. Stony continues to work for Blackton, hoping to get the evidence needed to clear Tucson, and tells his jack-of-all-trades friend Lullaby, who has taken over the barber shop from Smithers, to try to get some information from his talkative customers.
