Tomorrow Starts Tonight

 Four couples, in four very different relationships, but all with one thing in common, Karaoke. Relationships are never easy and communicating is sometimes even harder, but each of our four couples will come to realize that the best way to get your point across is to sing it out loud. Arguments will be settled, hearts will be broken, true love will be found. Tomorrow Starts Tonight is an original movie musical featuring 14 never before released tracks from a cast of talented and upcoming Australian stars
