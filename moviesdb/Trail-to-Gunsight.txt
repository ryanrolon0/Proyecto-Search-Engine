Trail to Gunsight

 Deputy Dan Creede trails bank robbers to a cabin and after a gunfight believes he killed the man Wagner he finds inside. Quitting his job he goes with Wagner's son and takes the foreman's job on the Wagner ranch. The bank robbers who actually killed Wagner also arrive and realize Dan has not told the Wagners he was the killer. As Dan has become attached to the boy, they threaten to expose him unless he lets them rustle Wagner's herd.
