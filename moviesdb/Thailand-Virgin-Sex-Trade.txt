Thailand Virgin Sex Trade

 Documentary style, following on from "Human Trafficking - South East Asia". This film examines how people become trapped into the sex trade industry in Thailand, and the impact it has on the Thai people, and the international community. Westerners travel to Thailand for sex tourism, and this documentary is going to highlight the industry, and what the international community is doing about stopping westerners traveling to Thailand for sex, particularly with children. Many countries have put special laws in place to enable them to prosecute their citizens for activities in any foreign country (especially third world countries) after they return home.
