Trading Church Street

 In 1981, the city of Anderson Completed the Demolition of the historically black commerce district locally referred to as Church Street. Constructed following the Civil War, the building were traditionally occupied by African-American businesses and became the location of choice for Blacks to do business away from the discrimination that was inherent in the South at the time. Unable to survive after integration allowed African-Americans to shop where they pleased, Church Street was transformed into a parking lot as part of a well intentioned plan to revitalize the downtown area. This documentary captures the stories of many of the surviving business owners and patrons while they reminisce about the pride, characters, events and social structure of their beloved Church Street.
