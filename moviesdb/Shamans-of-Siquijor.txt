Shamans of Siquijor

 Over three hundred miles south of the Philippine capital of Manila lies the tropical island of Siquijor, famous for its traditional healers, sorcerers, and witches. "Shamans of Siquijor" follows three healers to learn about their practices and beliefs. With guidance from the supernatural world, healers cure illnesses using medicinal herbs, incantations, a magical prayer wheel, and other means. Is folk healing still valuable for the social and spiritual life of the community or just a dying relic of old traditions?
