Rival Siblings

 Since they were young children, Joe and Josephine learned the art of Eskrima (Philippine Martial Arts) from their dearly departed father. It was apparent early on that the siblings would develop two contrasting schools of thought in how they practice and teach their craft. Josephine has a more traditional approach while expounding aphorisms that sound like, what Joe calls 'a bad 'Kung Fu' episode.' Joe on the other hand models his approach to 'The Karate Kid' and comic books. We see how they teach their young students their conflicting approach in a hilarious training sequence. Their differences come to a head at a family party where a hilarious, full blown, no holds barred fight scene ensues.
