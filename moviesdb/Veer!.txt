 After a decade of extravagant living and hard partying, Jesse Sorensen has just been dropped from his skating sponsorship. Now broke, he moves in with his elderly grandmother only to discover his 17 year old niece, Samantha, crashing there as well. Far from the little girl he remembers growing up, her reckless lifestyle is leading her down a dangerous path - a path Jesse knows all too well. He finds himself coming face to face with something he's never had to deal with before - responsibility. After a decade of refusing to grow up, Jesse must reconnect with his family and decide what to do with his own future.
