The Monster Walks

 A doctor, who keeps an ape for medical studies, dies and his daughter inherits his estate. Her uncle, a paralytic, working through his natural son by the housekeeper, plans her death, and the ape may or may not be involved. However, the plan does have a problem or two in its execution.
