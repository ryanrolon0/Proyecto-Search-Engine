Pour toujours, les Canadiens!

 William Langlois, 17, is the star player of his hockey team at the French College of Longueuil. At the end of the season, a few weeks before Christmas, he goes through a slump, demoralized by his coach's attitude, who criticizes him for his lack of team spirit. It's not going so great at home for William, either. His father, Benedict, is too busy completing a film on the 100 year anniversary of the Montreal Canadiens to remember he has a family, while his mother Michelle, a nurse, is occupied by the plight of one of her young patients, Daniel Leblanc, 10, who's awaiting a kidney transplant. The child, the eldest in a family of six, was rushed to Val d'Or. His determination and courage impressed the entire team at Ste-Justine Hospital, where he's being treated. His love of the game instills in him a strong will to live. Characters like Dr. Hebert, a pediatric nephrologist, the old Zamboni driver Gerry, coach Bordeleau, parents and friends of the children and the Canadian Club players will witness the destinies of these two youngsters cross, drawn by their passion for hockey.
