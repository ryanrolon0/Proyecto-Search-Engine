The Weary Traveller and His Wonderful Dream

 A picture that is both beautiful and mystical. An Egyptian fountain forms the background of the picture. An old worn out traveller comes into view and lies down in front of the fountain to rest, and here the dream begins. There appears from the depths of the fountain a beautiful fairy who transforms the poor old traveller into a prince. She then causes twelve beautiful maidens to appear before the prince. They proceed to form tableaux and perform for his amusement. A sedan chair then appears and the four servants proceed to carry the prince off on his journey. The scene is then changed to the old traveller lying before the fountain and being rudely awakened by the guard who commands him to go on.
