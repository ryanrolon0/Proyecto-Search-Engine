Red Riding Hood Meets Frankenstein

 A twist on the tale of Red Riding Hood and a loving nod to the films of Abott and Costello! It's Halloween night in 1947 and foreign exchange student George travels through the fog-filled forest of Transylvania where he meets Red Riding Hood at a remote bus stop. They share tales of the night that brought them there. Tales where they have met Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and more of the classic movie monsters! It's a night full of chills, thrills, and laughs! A night they might not survive!
