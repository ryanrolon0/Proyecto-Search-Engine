TimeShift

 TimeShift is an original first-person shooter offering unprecedented time-control elements that allow the player to slow, stop and reverse the flow of time while he remains completely unaffected. You are Michael Swift, a test pilot who has been tapped by the US Government to test two new time-control devices. Briefly sent back in time to gather data, you return to Washington D.C. in an alternate timeline as an enemy of the fascist government. Now on the run in a strange yet familiar world, it is your mission to set time straight once again.
