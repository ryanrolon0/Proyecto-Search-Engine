Silent Cry

 Giving birth to her first child should be a time of happiness for Rachel, but the dream is shattered when she learns that her newborn baby has died during the night. Despite the sympathetic overtures, Rachel is convinced things aren't what they seem and suspects her baby has been abducted. Certain that there's only one way to find out the truth, Rachel returns to the hospital. Here she encounters the menacing Dennis Betts and in an attempt to flee from him, she ís forced to hide in a car belonging to Daniel Stone, a hospital porter. Initially reluctant to help, Daniel's conscience eventually gets the better of him. The plot thickens further with the death of Rachel's best friend Annie and the discovery that Dennis Betts is actually a policeman, with his own very personal reasons for pursuing Rachel. As Rachel and Daniel race through London's nightscape, desperate to stay one step ahead of Betts, every discovery unleashes further hell, extending way beyond the disappearance of Rachel's baby. Their only solid lead seems to be Joanne, a young prostitute, whose own baby provides a link. But with Betts systematically eliminating anyone in his way, a further web of conspiracy unfolds and Rachel and Daniel are led to her old family doctor, Robert Barrum.
