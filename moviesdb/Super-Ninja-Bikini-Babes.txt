Super Ninja Bikini Babes

 Aliens Tantella and Gorath plan to invade Earth using the vortex of a cosmic storm, capture the greatest scientific minds and drain their knowledge, and then conquer the world. Eriko, a failing college coed who wastes all her time reading comic books and daydreaming, gets a bump on the head and wakes up in an alternate universe where she is given a talisman which can transform her into Super Ninja Doll upon command. After waking, Eriko visits the Bureau of Scientific Strangeness, where government agents are paid to listen to crackpot stories, and they provide her with info about the female scientist who's the next likely abduction target. Eriko turns into Super Ninja Doll and races off to thwart the aliens.
