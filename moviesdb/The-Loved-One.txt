The Loved One

 Newly arrived in Hollywood from England, Dennis Barlow finds he has to arrange his uncle's interment at the highly-organised and very profitable Whispering Glades funeral parlour. His fancy is caught by one of their cosmeticians, Aimee Thanatogenos. But he has three problems - the strict rules of owner Blessed Reverand Glenworthy, the rivalry of embalmer Mr Joyboy, and the shame of now working himself at The Happy Hunting Ground pets' memorial home. Whispering Glades is a funeral home in Los Angeles. The staff there take their role in life - and death - very seriously, wanting to make the funeral process as beautiful and meaningful as possible. This at least is the outward perception of the organization, and the life goal of Whispering Glades make-up artist, Aimee Thanatogenous, whose professional goal is to become the first female embalmer. In her mind, beauty trumps all else. She catches the eye of Dennis Barlow, recently arrived in Los Angeles from Britain, and who is at Whispering Glades to arrange the funeral of his uncle, Sir Francis Hinsley. Dennis does whatever he feels he needs to to gain the favor of Aimee. Standing in his way is his work at Happy Hunting Grounds, a pet funeral home that steals Whispering Glades philosophy, his job there about which he doesn't tell her, and the attention she receives from the embalmer at Whispering Glades, Dr. Joyboy. But Whispering Glades may not be all that Aimee thinks it is, which could affect her relationship with Dennis and her view on life and death.
