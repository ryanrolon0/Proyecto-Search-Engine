Ru-Ba-Ru

 Bangkok-based Tara Mishra and Nikhil Singh meet at a wedding ceremony and fall instantly in love with love with each. They move in together and continue to live a fairly blissful lifestyle until Tara is invited to India to attend a wedding. Nikhil not only refuses to accompany her but also refuses to introduce his widowed mother, Meera, who is now living with another male, Dilip, to her. Tara, a talented singer/dancer, feels neglected as he is always focused on his business, is not prepared to make any long-time commitment, and forgets important events. An encounter with a taxi-driver compels Nikhil to change his mind, but things do no work out, Tara leaves him and shortly thereafter passes away in an accident. A devastated and guilt-ridding Nikhil returns home, cradling her photo and falls asleep. He wakes up the next morning with Tara alive and well next to him. Was he hallucinating the events from the previous day or was he being warned by fate to change his ways?
