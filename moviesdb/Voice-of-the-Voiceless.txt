Voice of the Voiceless

 A documentary presenting the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, an award-winning journalist on death row, whose conviction for murder has inspired a worldwide appeal for a new trial. Featured commentary by Mumia Abu-Jamal himself, his contemporaries, and many young activists within the hip-hop community that view Abu-Jamal's conviction as a miscarriage of justice and a poignant commentary on the social, racial, and political inequalities of the US Criminal Justice system.
