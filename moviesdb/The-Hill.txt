The Hill

 The Allies have already taking the beach, now it is up to the blood sweat and tears, of the civilian soldier to help liberate France and the rest of Europe from Nazi Fascism. American units are looking to break out of the Hedgerow country, something that must be accomplished to establish a firm headquarters off of the beachhead. Lt. Gage and his squad of the 2nd infantry division are a group of soldiers not looking to be heroes, but execute every mission, even if it means death for their friends and brothers. The Hill must be taken.
