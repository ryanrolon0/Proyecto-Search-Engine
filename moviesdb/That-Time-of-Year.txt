That Time of Year

 Jeff is a rowdy go-go boy. David is a studious undergrad....unlikely pair? Maybe. Cody was just released from jail and is searching for his mercenary girlfriend Aariel, who's just met her long lost sister Lana, who's pining over school basketball star Nick. Meanwhile Sarah is trying to decide if she and classmate Erika should be more than friends, while Rodney and Nicole battle their racist families with an interracial relationship. Sound confusing? It's not really that hard to follow once you get into the story of this alternately comic and dark drama set in NYC.
