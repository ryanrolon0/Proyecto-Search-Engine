Unplanned

 Brendan arrives home to find his girlfriend, Hayley, in the driveway packing up her car full of all of her belongings. As Brendan interrogates Haley on her reasons for leaving, the roommates occasionally interrupt the conversation as they one-by-one inform Brendan about the rent money. Furthermore, the roommates choose to keep themselves in the awkward and uncomfortable situation by watching Brendan and Hayley argue from inside the garage. Brendan thinks he will be able to comfort Hayley and once again, convince her to stay. However, Brendan's expectations and hopes are crushed as Hayley informs Brendan that the baby she is pregnant with does not belong to him. The roommates react with utter shock, and watch with intense eyes as Brendan struggles with this new information.
