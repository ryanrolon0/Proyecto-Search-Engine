Some Dogs

 Jeff and Carl are a pair of friends who have gone their separate ways. They reunite for a night of drinking and fun, much to the dismay of Jeff's wife, who is uncomfortable with her husband's loser friend. What Jeff hasn't revealed to her is that the real plan for the evening is to meet up with another old friend, Heather. On their way to the meeting, the pair rehashes their past issues with each other and begin to develop a new issue regarding the true motive behind the meeting with Heather.
