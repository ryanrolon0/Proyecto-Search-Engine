Vernissage!1607, Caravaggio

 Naples. In the Pio Monte della Misericordia Church, Caravaggio presents his painting; the Seven Works of Charity, which is to decorate the main altar. It's a powerful painting, scandalous and for which he is promised a small fortune. The commissioners, hoping for great exposure so as to finance their charitable endeavors are distraught about genius will take back the painting at it's unveiling from the crowded church filled with luminaries of the time, unless he is paid in full.
