Slaughter Party

 Three years ago, the mother of Samantha Wright was murdered by her teacher, Ben Colman. Now, he's back. On the anniversary of her mom's death, Sam decides to throw a small party on her father's private island. As the night goes on, strange things begin happening, and her friends begin disappearing one-by-one. It's up to Sam and her boyfriend, Mike, to stop the madness before it's too late, but they will encounter something much greater than they could ever have anticipated. Slaughter Party is set up as an 80s style slasher spoof.
