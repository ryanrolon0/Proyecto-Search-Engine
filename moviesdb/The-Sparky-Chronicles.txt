The Sparky Chronicles

 Spy spoof. When a mysterious one-armed man kidnaps the family dog, three college-aged friends quickly form a crack search team to find their beloved K-9. Using the latest in high-tech gadgets and a computer-guided mobile headquarters, (conspicuously disguised as a '68 Volkswagen van), each "case" finds the three heroes hunting down clues and rubbing elbows with a cast of zany characters. In this episode (The Map) our three self-appointed secret agents narrowly miss rescuing Sparky and then find a map that shows exactly where he is. But the team disregards the map and instead embarks on their search using their own ingenuity. When they come to several forks in the road, they realize that everyone has a different opinion about which direction to take. Viewers discover an amazing parallel between the Bible and the map. The Bible is our navigational guide for life!
