The River

 The urban legend of La Llorona (Spanish for The Weeping Lady), comes to life in this morbid tale about the monstrous, vengeful boogie woman who wanders near bodies of water and wails into the night for her lost children, who she drowned after being spurned and deserted by their father. Miguel, a mercenary, soon learns that La Llorona is anything but a legend, when he is commissioned to locate and return a young runaway to a sleepy riverside town in order to rid it of La Llorona's curse. Miguel is successful in recovering the young girl; however as he is nearing the town he swerves to avoid a figure standing in the road and crashes his car. Awakening, he finds that the young girl is missing and heads towards the town to find her. There he discovers that cashing in might mean cashing out, in a story filled with Latin mythology, irony, and deception.
