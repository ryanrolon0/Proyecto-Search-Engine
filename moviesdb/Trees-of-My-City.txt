Trees of My City

 Dormancy. Death. Decay. It's All Good. The death of one man's brother and mother lead him to seek solace in the company of dormant, dead and decaying trees in his city. Over four seasons of one calendar year, he gets to know the trees, birds and squirrels in his town and meditates on endings, beginnings and the possibility of universal consciousness. This is that man's true story. That man is me. Family memories and nature observations are woven together as Trees of My City compels viewers to expand their views of death, life and rebirth to include all living things in the fullness of existence.
