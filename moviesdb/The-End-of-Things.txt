The End of Things

 'the end of things' is a short film exploring the end of a relationship between a young couple. Playing with the lyricism and poetics of memory and experience, the film intercuts flashbacks of times the couple spent together with present-day scenes of silent dysfunction between the two on their final day together, which they spend in a Japanese garden. It is an exploration the thoughts and emotions that emerge at the end of things.
