Show Me Your Original Face

 'Show me your original face' is a Zen koan. A question designed to force one to jump beyond the intellect and perhaps perceive something of the true nature of who we really are. This film is a series of seven portraits. By the use of unusual, manipulated images and complex sound design, this film attempts to convey something of the 'original nature' of each of the subjects.
