The Trace of Emotion

 The emotion of people easily changes. It is not easy to define what emotion is. We just feel it. To feel emotion is like to observe nature because nature always changes by time, sun, and wind. When we observe nature, the nature tries to say what our emotion is because the nature leaves the trace of emotion.
