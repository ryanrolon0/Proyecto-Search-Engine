The Madison Kid

 In 1989, the 24-year-old Hellmuth became the youngest World Champion of Poker by defeating the two-time defending champion, Johnny Chan, in the World Series of Poker main event. Hellmuth attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for three years before dropping out to play poker full time much to the chagrin of his father, a professor at the school.
