The Stand at Apache River

 Sheriff Lane Dakota captures robbery-murder suspect Greiner just as the latter is wounded in an Apache ambush. At remote outpost Apache River, Lane and his prisoner spend the night with other travelers, including 2 women with a surprising number of fancy dresses. In the morning, who should appear but a band of ostensibly peaceful Apaches strayed from the reservation. And bigoted Colonel Morsby is strongly inclined to shoot first and ask questions afterward... When Apaches break out of the reservation they end up at Apache River Station. Already there are a sheriff bringing a wounded killer in, a city girl on her way to meet her fiance, an army colonel, the owner's disaffected wife, and the hired help who fancies her. At first the Indians are peaceable, but the colonel, whom they loathe from the past, changes all that.
