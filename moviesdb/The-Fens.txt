The Fens

 The Fens is a story of friendship, tradition and most importantly, perspective. Following three friends through a petty argument, we discover that Richie is having some serious girl issues, Bobby is sticking his nose where it doesn't belong, and Sean is quiet for a reason we don't yet know. Do you ever get caught up in the day-to-day stuff, at the risk of loosing sight of the big picture?
