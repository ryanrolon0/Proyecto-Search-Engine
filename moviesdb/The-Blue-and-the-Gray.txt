The Blue and the Gray

 This short, the seventh in the 'See America First' series, opens with a slightly corrupted version of the following quote from 'Sir Walter Scott' (qv) never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land!" As the narrator tells the story of the American Civil War, the audience visits various cities, battlefields, buildings, and monuments associated with the war's personalities and battles. The film ends with newsreel footage of a parade of Civil War veterans.
