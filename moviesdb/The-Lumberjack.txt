The Lumberjack

 A group of friends set up camp after a long day of hiking. Around the campfire, they laugh, drink, and tell ghost stories. Sam, one of the hikers, has a story unlike anything they've ever heard. He tells a gruesome, horrific story of a local lumberjack. A story that they will never forget!
