Under Uruguay

 In 1971 and Uruguay is effectively under military rule - a dictatorship leaching the very lives of the people. And it is in just such times that heroes are born. The Tupamaros were formed as a peaceful political voice, a jeans by which the common man could be heard. But as taxes rose the military tightened their grip so they were forced to take much stronger action. Systematically robbing the rich to feed the poor, the Tupas soon became a major thorn in the side of Ricardo Hoffman, the man tasked with bringing down the freedom fighting organization -and so he unleashed a bloody camping of mass arrests, torture and selected disappearances, eventually rounding up every know member of the Tupamaros and incarcerating them in the infamous Punta Carretas Prision. But with the freedom of their country at stake, it was not long before the Tupas were plotting a daring extraordinary escape.
