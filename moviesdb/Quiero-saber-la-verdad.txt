Quiero saber la verdad

 This short film talks about two different ways of seen a terrible situation. One is about guilty, how some times we are so inside ourselves that we don't realize that the people near to us could be feeling terribly bad. But it also shows that sometimes we feel guilty about something that wasn't in our hands.
