The Woman Next Door

 Mrs. Randolph Schuyler is married to a most unappealing man and longs for freedom from him, if not from his support. She takes on the identity of Vicky Van, a fun-loving young woman without ties, and proceeds to maintain a double life. But when the husband Schuyler is murdered, "Vicky" finds herself the object of a police search.
