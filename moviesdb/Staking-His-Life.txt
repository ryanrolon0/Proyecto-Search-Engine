Staking His Life

 In this re-edited, re-titled version of 'Conversion of Frosty Blake, The (1915)' (qv), some character names are changed but the story, of a New England pastor who goes out west for his health and encounters a gun-toting dance-hall owner and a beautiful dancer, remains fairly intact.
