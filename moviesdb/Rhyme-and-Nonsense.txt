Rhyme and Nonsense

 Rhymes and nonsense contains a message for grown-ups. Professors Boel Westin, Maria Nikolajeva and Janina Orlov take us on a fascinating journey from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland to the works of the Scandinavian nursery rhymes master Lennart Hellsing. They introduce us to profound and less conventional ways of looking at modern children's literature. Author Stella Parland and illustrator Linda Bondestam represent the new generation of creators of books for children. Almost 90-year-old Lennart Hellsing himself appears in the film reading and explaining his writings, some of which were at their time even censored due to their anarchistic content.
