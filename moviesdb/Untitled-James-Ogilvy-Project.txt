Untitled James Ogilvy Project

 The VP of mergers and acquisitions at his investment banking firm, James Ogilvy's only interest is doing whatever it takes to land the next big client. Forced to go to Jamaica to settle his wealthy father's affairs, James' indifference to his father's housekeeper and her daughter causes the abduction of the little girl and sends James deep into a world of corruption and abuse in his fight to get her back.
