The Three-Cornered Hat

 The Three-Cornered Hat is a work with deep roots in literature, music and folklore. The story of 'The Three-Cornered Hat' (or 'The Corregidor') officially dates back to a collection of ballads, Romancero General, published in Spain by Agustin Duran in 1821. Duran took the ballad from a broadsheet that he purchased in the street by a blind man. This bawdy tale of marital confusion between a Corregidor, a Miller and the Miller's wife no doubt had a long history before it was turned into a ballad and in 1874 it became the basis of a novel by the most widely read Spanish author of the day. In 1874, El Sombrero de Tres Picos, or The Three-Cornered Hat, was published by Pedro Antonio de Alarcon. The story had obsessed Alarcon for many years and he claims to have first heard it in the form of a ballad recited by an old shepard. Twenty-two years later, in 1896, Hugo Wolf based an opera on the story and in 1919 Diaghileff put it on stage as a balet, The Three-Cornered Hat, with music by Manuel de Falla and costumes and decor by Picasso. Over 80 years later, The Three-Cornered Hat is brought to the screen in a loose adaptation by A.D. Liano, based on a short story by Greg Boyd.
