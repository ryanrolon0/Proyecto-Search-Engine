Thundering Jets

 Captain Steve Morley (Rex Reason) must evaluate how the men under his command react to pressure and stress at high altitudes in the latest jet fighters, with the usual romantic subplot involving him, another officer, and a pretty young lady. Exciting flight sequences, filmed at Edwards (Muroc) Air Force Base, California, showcases Reason and other "pilots" going off into the wild blue [black & white] yonder, in wide screen Regalscope (CinemaScope).
