Red Planet

 In the near future, Earth is dying. A new colony on Mars could be humanity's only hope. A team of American astronauts, each a specialist in a different field, is making the first manned expedition to the red planet and must struggle to overcome the differences in their personalities, backgrounds and ideologies for the overall good of the mission. When their equipment suffers life-threatening damage and the crew must depend on one another for survival on the hostile surface of Mars, their doubts, fears and questions about God, man's destiny and the nature of the universe become defining elements in their fates. In this alien environment they must come face to face with their most human selves. In 2055, earth is no longer viable enough for food production. A promising algae experiment on Mars runs into trouble, so a small Air Force-civilian scientific-technician team travels there. The emergency landing is a nearly-fatal disaster survival and return capacity. Even AMEE, a navigation drone, is accidentally switched into its dangerous military mode. As if that weren't bad enough, errors, suspicions and emotions like guilt make the men on mars an woman on watch in the ship behave erratically. Yet some startling discoveries and Robby Gallagher's inventiveness rekindle hope, at least for earth.
