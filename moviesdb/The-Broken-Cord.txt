The Broken Cord

 David Norwell, an anthropology professor, wants to adopt a child even though he is single. He is finally given a Native American child who might be slightly different from other children. In fact, Adam, the child, soon starts showing signs of mental illness. Through the years, David tries to help his son overcome his disability but he finds it difficult when Adam won't help himself. It is later discovered that Adam was born from an alcoholic mother and is the cause of his problems.
