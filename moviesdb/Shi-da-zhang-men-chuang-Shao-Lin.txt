Shi da zhang men chuang Shao Lin

 After the sacred scripts of Tammo are stolen from Shaolin, a young girl is taught 18 forms of Shaolin kung fu to enable her to venture outside the temple and recover all of the volumes. Accompanied by the ten Shaolin masters, the girl must endure multiple furious battles to restore the sacred texts to the temple. Twenty-foot-long-arms, 30-foot-long legs, eagle, tiger, crane and dragon are just some of the techniques on display in this mad martial-arts classic.
