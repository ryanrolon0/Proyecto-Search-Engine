South Park Rally

 South Park is no longer safe! The Mayor has decided to stage a rally series that will take place through the heart and outskirts of South Park. All of your favorite characters are now armed to the teeth with destructive automobiles, including police cars, mini Porsches, Big Gay Al buggies, wheat bags, jeeps and dozens of other demented vehicles. It seems as though everyone is out for glory.
