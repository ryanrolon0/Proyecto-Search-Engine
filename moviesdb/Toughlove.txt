Toughlove

 A rebellious 17 year old is increasingly getting into trouble, doing drugs, and hiding events from his parents. As things spiral further out of control, his parents turn to an organization called "Toughlove" for help. There they learn that it sometimes is necessary to turn your back on your child and allow him to accept the consequences of his actions.
