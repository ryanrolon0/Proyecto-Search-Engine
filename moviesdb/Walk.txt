Walk

 A twelve-minute experimental-documentary, explores the themes of inner-strength and step-by- stepping fear and wonder through the eyes of children. The film contemplates Hebrew language and Talmudic parables as a foundation. The project was filmed at the Smith and Bybee wetlands in Portland, Oregon.
