Sins of Jezebel

 The aging Ahab, king of Israel, comes under the influence of a young and beautiful but scheming pagan woman named Jezebel and, against the advice of his advisers and the prophet Elijah, marries her. Her plan to introduce her pagan idols to Israel angers God, who decides to wreak vengeance on Israel.
