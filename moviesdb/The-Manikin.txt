The Manikin

 Mr. Viggs is given the task of assembling a store window mannequin. When nothing he tries seems to work, he takes the dummy's place rather than suffer the wrath of his impatient boss. After falling in love with a passing window shopper, however, Mr. Viggs abandons his modeling career to win the lady's heart, and a hilarious chase ensues.
