The Reed Sisters

 Bound by a contract to become 'rich and famous' the teenage Reed Sisters sang and danced their way through the 1970's and early 80's in a homegrown musical variety show that aired on cable access TV in Oak Ridge, TN. When one of the sisters goes missing complications arise, but the 'show must go on!'
