Trois rois

 In a small Central American country with a population of 270,000, three veteran musicians share moments of their daily lives with us. Paul Nabor, 79 year old fisherman and legendary Garifuna composer has played the same guitar for 53 years. Even though he has forgotten most of his songs, his spirit remains strong.  Florencio Mess, a Maya harp player, spends his solitude making traditional violins, guitars and harps as he awaits for his next trip outside his small village. Creole accordionist, Wilfred Peters, is proud to have played for the Queen of England, his ineffable charm and humor is his ideal antidote for the old age.
