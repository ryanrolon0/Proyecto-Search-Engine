Shooting Locations

 SHOOTING LOCATIONS is researching the borderlines between war, playing war, war games and the disappearance of the separation between reality and fiction. The combination of "found footage" sounds at Youtube from England, Honkong and Afghanistan with images of a 19th century villa, a skyscraper and townhouses are irritating.
