USS Franklin

 Emotions run deep, still today, in the surviving men of the USS Franklin. The carrier, known as "The Ship That Wouldn't Die", survived a direct hit by a Japanese armor-piecing bomb just fifty miles off the coast of Japan in March 1945. In an instant the crew's lives were changed forever and the events that followed would make the story of "Big Ben" one of the most dramatic and inspiring in naval history.
