VK

 A group of elite soldiers trained in the supernatural are sent to find out what exactly happened to a missing priest who was deep under cover within a cult and the 1st elite team sent to rescue him. Once there it seems something evil has been waiting for them too. Trapped in the catacombs of the evil presence, they come under attack from a relentless army of possessed souls. The VK squad will have to use all their skills to survive the onslaught.
