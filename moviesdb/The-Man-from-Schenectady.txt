The Man from Schenectady

 When Agent X 13 - A top spy is hit by a car and ends up in a coma, a naive door to door salesman who looks like him is recruited to take his place. Surrounded by friend and foe and many people who supposedly are working with him but are actually trying to kill him, this man must have a guardian angel or just plain dumb luck to even survive.
