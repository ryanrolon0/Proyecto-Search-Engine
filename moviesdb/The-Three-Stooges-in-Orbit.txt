The Three Stooges in Orbit

 The Three Stooges have a show to do, but since the rehearsals require cooking, they manage to get themselves thrown out of every hotel they can find. They finally find room and board at the home of the goofy inventor, Professor Danforth, but that home has it's own problems. Namely, the Professor is working on a new all-terrain, flying, space worthy submersible. With some persuading, the Stooges agree to help him finish his invention and demonstrate it to the military. However, the Martians are interested in the vechile as well and when they learn of its perfection, they plan to steal it and destroy the Earth. Like it or not, the fate of the world rests on the courage of Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe.
