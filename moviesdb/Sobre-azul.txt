Sobre azul

 All ends before it starts. At 15, the Portuguese athletes of synchronized swimming get through the end of their careers. In a country where football is king, this kind of sport can't be more than a peripheral subject. A small satellite stuck within Lisbon's suburbs With no future, no visibility, no sponsoring.What moves this girls and what makes them carry on ?In Portugal, a sport like this means trying to live under water, floating and breathing. But isn't it what it means to live in this country? To live a life upside down, trying not to breath ?
