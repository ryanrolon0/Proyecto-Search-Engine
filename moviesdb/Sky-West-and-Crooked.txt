Sky West and Crooked

 Seventeen year old Brydie White is emotionally stunted due to an accidental shooting death with which she was involved when she was an adolescent, the incident which she doesn't remember. Mrs. White, a widow, recluse and alcoholic, still treats her daughter like a child, although she pays her daughter little attention. However, Brydie is physically becoming a young woman. Always fascinated by death, Brydie's new pastime is to bury any dead animal in the local church graveyard. She has convinced all the young children of her small English rural town to do the same, the animal plots complete with grave markers. These animal burials are the last straw for many of the townsfolk, who see Brydie as a menace and bad influence who should be locked away. The vicar, Reverend Phillip Moss, although as perturbed by the animal graves as anyone, does understand Brydie's position more than anyone in the town and wants to do what is best for her. When it looks that Brydie is in some real danger, Roibin Krisenki, one in a band of gypsies recently settled in the area, takes it upon himself to be her savior. Brydie White is a 17-year-old retarded girl living in a rural English village whom finds solace in buyring pet animals in the church cemetary and strikes up a few friendships with a few village children while her disapproving mother and a loathsome drunkard get in the way of her newfound hobby.
