Stagehand

 The setting is a small community theater, and the scene is an audition for a key role in the earnest drama "The Richest Man in Town." Much to his chagrin, Broadway veteran Quincy has to read his leading role while inexperienced actors audition to play opposite him. Quincy's testy behavior exasperates his director, infuriates his would-be costars, and fascinates a stagehand who watches from the wings. When Quincy abruptly leaves the audition, it creates an unexpected opportunity for a quiet bystander to become part of the show.
