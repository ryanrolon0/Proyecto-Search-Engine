Walk the Dream

 Walk the Dream is the inspiring story of four young filmmakers in pursuit of their dreams as they venture across the country. Walking from New York to Los Angeles, they interview locals and celebrities who wish to share the story of their own accomplishments. From those who have achieved everything they've set out to do, to those whose endeavors have not yet come to fruition, the four hope to find insight as to how they may fulfill their own dreams and inspire others to follow their lead.
