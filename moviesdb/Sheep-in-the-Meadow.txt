Sheep in the Meadow

 The sheep are gazing in a rustic little meadow and their herder falls asleep. The wolf sneaks up, steals his horn and lures the sheep to his place, but they escape. But the wolf captures Mary's pet lamb...and eats it. No, that's another story. He has the lamb in his stew-pot and the hero rescues it.
