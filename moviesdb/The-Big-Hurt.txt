The Big Hurt

 A reporter looking into the death of a research scientist finds more deaths connected to the man, including some dubious "suicides". He discovers that the scientist may have been killed to cover up a secret government plot concerning mind-control drugs that have been tested on unknowing civilians, and he becomes involved with the scientist's daughter, who is trying to clear her father's name.
