Speed Racer

 This is the first title to ever compile into one edition all the content ever-created related to the popular 1960's anime program, "Speed Racer." In addition to offering episode synopses and edited scenes from the original 52 films, the producers have also included content from the 1990's effort to re-launch the series, with animation from the studio that produced "The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." The producers also assisted Speed Racer Enterprises in the creation of a new Speed Racer program for the new century -- and the fully edited pilot is included as a bonus. Interviews, clips, interactive trivia and editorials abound, with a strong emphasis on all the product that has been manufactured over the years since the original show premiered. Everything you would ever want to know about Speed Racer, the hit Japanese anime series from the 1960's, which continues to draw fans today. Discover all the depth of what went into the original series and all the attempts to relaunch the property. Includes massive directory of animated clips and original content never-before seen. Interviews, archival footage and rare photos of the animated series, from sketch to animatic to final produced show, are all handsomely compiled together into a compelling story about how a low budget piece of Japanese anime became a cult classic and worked its way into the American cultural conscience.
