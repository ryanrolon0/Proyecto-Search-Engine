Viimeinen keikka

 Four aging friends, ex-members of a dance band that split decades ago, gather to play once more at the funeral of their band's fifth player. Old quarrels re-emerge, made worse by the different roles the men have since taken in their lives. One is a dentist, one a priest, and one is just a bitter old dance musician with an inclination to drinking and making obnoxious comments.
