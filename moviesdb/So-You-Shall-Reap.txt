So You Shall Reap

 This sarcastic documentary was created out of material shot on a mobile phone during a Kingsway International Christian Centre conference, where the director was in charge of sound and she couldn't resist making an alternative recording of the monstrous sermons transforming service to God into a show heavily focused on collecting money from the members of the community in the name of pastoral activities, which, however, resemble consumer magic more than anything else.
