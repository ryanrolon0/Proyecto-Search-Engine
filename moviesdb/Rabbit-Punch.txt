Rabbit Punch

 It's the night of the Big Fight between Tommy Tortoise and Michael "Moe" Hare. Tommy takes a beating at first and "Moe" knocks him through the "screen" onto the the animator's table, where Tommy learns what strategy and weapons "Moe" will be using in the fight. Since his shell is good protection, Tommy produces two more shells and "Moe" is soon confused by having to play the old shell game. The hare then stuffs horseshoe into his gloves, but the tortoise reacts by pushing a magnet for the rabbit's throat. The rabbit is soon punching himself.
