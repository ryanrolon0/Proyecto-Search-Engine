Viol@

 Marta is an interviewer for a poll company dreams but she lives a cold and single life, after having left her boyfriend just before the marriage. One day she tries an online sex chat with the nickname of Viola and 'meets' Wittler, and a sort of burning sex relationship starts. Day after day, he gets more and more power over Marta until he manages to get her real name and address, and the border between online life and real life vanishes.
