Señor Americano

 U.S. Army Lieutenant Michael Banning is sent to Mexican-owned southern California to investigate lawless land grabbing. There, he (and his horse Tarzan) wins a golden bridle in a riding contest sponsored by Carmelita, daughter of the Spanish Grandee Don Manuel. This irrates Ramirez, who has plans for Carmelita himself, and he attempts to steal the bridle but Banning subdues him. Maddox, leader of the land-grabbers, has Banning jailed.
