Professor Small and Mr. Tall

 Small and Tall break a mirror on a train trip and their seven years of bad luck start immediately. Stranded by an accident, they have trouble in a ghost town and finally are lost in the desert. The mirror saves them when they piece it back together, and everything is okay until they break the mirror again and their troubles start anew.
