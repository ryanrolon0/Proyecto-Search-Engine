The Story of Jazz

 The Story of Jazz as told by New Orleans' local, John McCusker, whose popular "Cradle of Jazz" tour takes viewers to the places where the evolution of jazz began and where its pioneers lived. We see the homes and learn the history of great musicians, such as Louis Armstrong, King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton who helped turn jazz into a major art form. Filmed in the Crescent City during the French Quarter Jazz festival and the Spring festival of Mardi Gras, this jazz-umentary is a celebration of the city, its music and the happy people who congregate there to have a good time.
