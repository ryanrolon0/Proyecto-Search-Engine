Post

 From talented young Director Rebecca Gower comes "Post", an atmospheric and uniquely British short drama film featuring a stunning lead performance from rising star of stage and screen Kate Walsh. Dealing with themes of isolation, loneliness and grief, this is a film that speaks to the very heart of the human condition. When a sympathetic stranger, a local posty (portrayed by Kiara Hawker in an impressive debut performance), uses her daily visits and personal letters to encourage a tormented agoraphobic woman out of her self-imposed solitude, we begin to learn more about the mysterious figure at the center of this compelling story and the tragic events that have left her a shadow of her former self. But just as her new friend's small acts of kindness begin to reaffirm her long lost optimism and help her open up to the possibility of life in the outside world, the woman receives an unwelcome reminder of her traumatic past and she retreats into seclusion once again. Can she still find happiness, or will her unresolved grief continue to consume her?
