The Diary

 Eric, a young New-Yorker working for a prestigious advertising company is transferred to Montreal, Canada. Reclusive by nature, Eric becomes overwhelmed by the cultural clash. Alone in a foreign, French-speaking city, he decides to start a diary to break his solitude. However, the hobby quickly turns into a compulsory outlet, one that adds to his feeling of alienation. Observing his surroundings in silence, Eric still manages to find humor in all of his social indiscretions and faux pas. A series of random encounters will break him out of his shell and give him the opportunity to finally settle into his new environment.
