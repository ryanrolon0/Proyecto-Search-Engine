The Bum of Beauregard

 A starving bum leaves the fate of the nature of the rest of his day up to chance. When the result is negative, he leaves in a huff, only to see a rich man standing on the side of the road, waiting for a bus. Seeing an opportunity, the bum masterfully steals the mans' belongings, to hilarious and sad consequences.
