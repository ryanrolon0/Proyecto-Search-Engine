The Ballad of the Waves

 A movie taking you through the only relationship that we can 'Choose' on our own - Friendship. Its a short 30 minutes film that is targeted for all from any walk of life who would have tasted the fruits of 'friendship' in their life. It is an effort to touch a chord in all to make them realize the importance to retain such a beautiful bonding in life. After 7 years of peaceful isolation, life springs a severe shock on Jerrin, in the form of "Cancer". The advent of the disease becomes a realization that blows Jerrin apart and makes him yearn for his long lost friends, mainly his closest buddy, "Berkin". Berkin was a constant support for him, through trials and tribulations, in happy and joyful times, in sad and melancholic times - a friend who Jerrin believes could have led him through this tough blow that life had dealt him with, with ease! Does Jerrin manage to get past his ego to weave a new ballad in his life?
