Sharp Dressed Men

 After 30 years together, Henry's parents are finally getting married. As the responsible oldest son he wants everything to be perfect on their big day. But his youngest brother Tom can barely stay conscious and George (the middle brother) can't stop thinking about his ex-wife long enough to focus on the wedding. To complicate things further, Rhonda, the wedding coordinator chooses today to tell George that she's loved him for 10 years. Can Henry pull everyone together in time for the wedding? And what will his parents do if he can't?
