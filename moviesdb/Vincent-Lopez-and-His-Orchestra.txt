Vincent Lopez and His Orchestra

 This musical short begins with 'Vincent Lopez (I)' (qv) leading his orchestra in "Nola", the group's theme song. Suddenly, various musicians tell Lopez that they are tired of the theme song and refuse to play it anymore. They sing and play other songs instead. Then the group plays familiar tunes of the day, accompanying band vocalists and virtuoso whistler 'Fred Lowery' (qv).
