Vastutuulesaal

 Headwind Hall is a documentary film about the conductor Tõnu Kaljuste and his crazy idea of building an opera house on the estate of the past inventor Schmidt in Naissaar; an island which even today has no regular ferry line, no electricity and only one permanent resident. In order to carry his idea through, Kaljuste must face situations bordering on the absurd involving potential investors, snobby bureaucrats, construction workers and the general public. He transports construction materials and other necessities to the island with his own small boat. The press and the representatives of different institutions cannot refrain from gloating - what is he trying to prove? The idea is almost as crazy as inventor Schmidt's erstwhile headwind ship that used the energy of headwind in order to move ahead with double power. However, in the summer of 2006, Nargen Opera is completed and the first performances are carried through. The amusing and dynamic film follows the activities of Tõnu Kaljuste during the period of five years.
