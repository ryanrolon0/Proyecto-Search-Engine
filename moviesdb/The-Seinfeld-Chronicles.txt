The Seinfeld Chronicles

 In this episode, the predecessor to "Seinfeld" (1990), Jerry is expecting a woman that he met in Michigan to come and visit him in New York. Throughout the first part of the show Jerry and George are discussing the situation. Later we meet "Kessler" who comes in to Jerry's apartment to borrow some meat and uncharacteristically knocks on the door before entering.
