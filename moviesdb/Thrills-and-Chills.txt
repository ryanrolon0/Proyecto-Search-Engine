 Betty Boop and her pup, Pudgy, board a ski-train for a winter sports resort. Betty goes skating, but is annoyed by a skier. Meanwhile, Pudgy had been playing and prancing on the ice and gets marooned on a cake that breaks off and floats toward a waterfall. The skier picks up Betty and they rescue Pudy.
