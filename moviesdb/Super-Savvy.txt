Super Savvy

 A family feud plays out as a super hero battle rages right outside their door. Tension runs high as the battle grows nearer and nearer until the battle makes its way inside their home, only to make their own problems as a family come to a halt in a realization of family priorities...love, trust, and appreciation.
