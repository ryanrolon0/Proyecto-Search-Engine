This Modern Love

 Bradley walks into a bar for a relaxing evening of listening to his friend play guitar and hanging with the guys. Unfortunately fate has a different idea. The three loves of Bradley's life are at the same bar and they all want one thing...him. His old long lost first love, the really hot girl that he dated last year and the girl that is one of the guys all have their sights set on him. Bradley has an interesting night trying to maneuver through the evening and the land-mines these girls set for him. His friends are anything but supportive and make fun of him throughout. Maybe Bradley meets a new girl, maybe the long lost love has a bombshell to tell him? Maybe Bradley just goes home alone? Anyhow it is a night to remember about..."This Modern Love"
