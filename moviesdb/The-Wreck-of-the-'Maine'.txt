The Wreck of the 'Maine'

 "This picture, taken at the same time as the above [Divers at work on the Maine], gives a comprehensive view of the wreck as seen from the deck of a tug passing completely around it. None of the debris had been removed, and the awful destruction caused by the explosion is plainly seen."
