The Dude and the Bootblacks

 A young New York blood of the "Reggy" type appears on the sidewalk and calls a bootblack. Two young street arabs rush at him, each eager for the job. A lively fight ensues for possession of the coveted nickel, and when the young dude attempts to separate the bootblacks, they turn upon him. Throwing him to the sidewalk, they proceed to smear his face with the blacking. When the young man finally regains an upright position, his clothes are wrecked and his complexion is darkened.
