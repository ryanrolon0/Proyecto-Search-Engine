Waiting for Ronald

 After spending most of his years in an institution, developmentally disabled Ronald says good-bye to his friends and caretaker to join his buddy Edgar in the exciting world of independence. Armed with busfare, a lifetime packed into one small suitcase, and a heart full of courage, Ronald boards the bus that will take him to Edgar and a new life. But Edgar, fighting demons of his own, runs into a problem before the bus carrying his new roommate arrives. What happens next is a testament to faith, humor, bravery, and true friendship.
