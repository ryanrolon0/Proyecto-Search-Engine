Super DuckTales

 For their mother's birthday, the Beagle Boys secretly alter the city plans for a major roadway so that it runs directly through Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin. With no alternative, Scrooge must have his Bin physically moved and he decides to hire an accountant to keep track of his assets for the move. This is where Fenton Crackshell comes in as a goofy but ambitious literal beancounter who wants a better job. He gets Scrooge's opening and proves to be a mixed asset with a tendency to goof up, but doggedly determined to make amends each time. When he stumbles on to a suit of power armor that inventor Gyro Gearloose made, he becomes Gizmoduck, a superhero that may not be the most competent, but he gets the job done.
