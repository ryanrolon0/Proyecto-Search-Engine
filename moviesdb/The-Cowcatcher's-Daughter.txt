The Cowcatcher's Daughter

 "Old-fashioned rancher father Pop Martin wants his wayward daughter Marje to marry foreman Jim Brady just as soon as she leaves the finishing school he has sent her to make her behave herself. Marje prefers dashing young cattle inspector Frank Thornby and runs away from school. Jim finds Marje and brings her home. Pop is waiting for his disobedient daughter. Marje has a lot of explaining to do, and a lot of cajoling if she's to marry Frank instead of Jim. A slapstick battle of wills follows between Pop and Marje."
