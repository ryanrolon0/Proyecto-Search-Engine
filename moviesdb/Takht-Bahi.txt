Takht Bahi

 This documentary takes us on a journey through time and shows us the splendor of the Buddha Monastery at Takht Bahi, one of the archaeological sites in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan - the cradle of the great Gandhara civilization that once flourished in this part of the world. Starting from the Peshawar Museum, which has the most extensive collection of Gandhara art, we are taken to the sites in an attempt to re-create the times when the place was full of Buddhist Monks who had come from all over the world to seek knowledge and meditate.
