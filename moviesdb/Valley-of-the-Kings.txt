Valley of the Kings

 Hard-boiled archeologist Mark Brandon is searching for ancient tombs in Egypt when he is approached by beautiful Ann Mercedes, who convinces him to help her fulfill her deceased father's life's ambition - to provide solid proof of the biblical Joseph's travels in ancient Egypt. As an ex-pupil of Ann's father Mark accepts and the two embark on a search for the tomb of the Pharoah Ra Hotep, said to have had some connection with Joseph. The trail to the tomb is fraught with intrigue, betrayal, murder and the possibility that the tomb itself has been emptied of all its artifacts by ancient looters. Ann Barclay Mercedes wants to continue her father's quest to find tomb of Rah-ho-tep, believing that it may have definite proof of the biblical tale of Joseph in Egypt. He believed that a gold statue he found for sale in London comes from that tomb and the find suggests that the tomb has already been located by someone. Ann enlists the aid of archaeologist Mark Brandon to help her and her husband trace the tomb. They have little success but a dealer in mostly dubious antiquities does seem to provide the information she needs. There are those however who will go to any lengths to prevent them from interfering with their very lucrative black market dealings.
