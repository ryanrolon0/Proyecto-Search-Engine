Stubblejumper

 In the fall of 1975, while attending the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, Doug Wilson placed an ad in the students' newspaper, seeking to start a campus gay group. This seemingly benign action would serve as the catalyst for a dramatic unfolding of events, shaping the future of Wilson's life. Stubblejumper is a biographical docudrama on the life and work of gay activist Doug Wilson - a story filled with activism, poetry, performance, politics, and a touching yet tragic love story.
