Ulzhan

 Somewhere in the endless steppes of Central Asia lies a treasure. One man holds the key to it, a fragment of an ancient map. But in his restless quest, Charles isn't looking for fame or glory. He's looking for a way to heal his wounded soul. He's looking for love. Ulzhan felt it the first time she laid eyes on him.
