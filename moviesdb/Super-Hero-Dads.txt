Super Hero Dads

 'Super Hero Dads' is about dads in the UK, seeking the right to see their children. 'Fathers-4-Justice' demonstrated against the current state of Family Law on Friday 18th June 2004 in Central London. Protesting against inherent gender bias in the law, they demand equality with mothers, and a legal presumption to contact with their kids. 'Batman' and the other 'Super Heroes' reveal their utter vulnerability to a strong dose of Family Court 'Kryptonite'.
