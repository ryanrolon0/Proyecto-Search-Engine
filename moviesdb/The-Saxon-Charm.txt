The Saxon Charm

 Eric Busch, a novelist/playwright, and his wife, Janet, go to New York where he arranges to have Matt Saxon, who has a reputation for ruthlessness, produce his play. Saxon insists on so many meetings, changes and revisions that it cause a rift between Eric and Janet. Saxon goes to Hollywood to get a prominent actor to play the lead but the actor, no fan of Saxon, declines. Saxon then deliberately robs his own girlfriend of her chance in Hollywood. The actor then comes to New York and offers to do the play, if someone other than Saxon is the producer.
