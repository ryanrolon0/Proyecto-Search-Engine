Silent Drum

 Silent Drum is a 70 min documentary film introducing a very unique Kenyan dance team. The dancers of this all girls group will never fully hear the beautiful sounds they produce - all of them are deaf. As Tabitha, Ann, Mbaile and Eunice are preparing for an upcoming dance performance, one gets a chance to look into their solitary world of silence. As any other deaf or disabled person in Kenya, they are faced with oppression and social marginalization. However, the school offers them sanctuary - apart from physical, social and tribal differences they are here given their chance to show what they are made of. By performing ancestral Kikamba dances on various occasions the girls do not only excel their own, but also the public expectations. They challenge hearing students and they finally get the feeling to be equal.
