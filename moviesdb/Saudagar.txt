Saudagar

 Two close childhood friends, Veeru Singh and Rajeshwar Singh, become bitter enemies over misunderstandings created by Chuniya. So much so that they have divided their territories and will not permit anyone from one's to cross over to the other's without getting killed. In this background, Vashu and Radha, who belong to different families', the grandchildren of Veeru and Rajeshwar, fall in love and meet secretly. Old wounds, rivalries, and accusations surface when their love is discovered, and both are told not to see each other ever again, or else they will face certain death.
