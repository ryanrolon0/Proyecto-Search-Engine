Sheila Takes a Bow

 Sheila is an unpublished writer/waiter until a restaurant fire forces her to take a job as a production assistant on adult films. Now she must deal with disapproving friends, an unconsummated romance and her own religious upbringing. Can a nice girl crew on adult film sets and stay a nice girl?
