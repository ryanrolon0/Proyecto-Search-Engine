The Star, the Castle & the Butterfly

 In Jewish tradition, Prague is known as "a city and a mother in the family of Israel" and, for over 1000 years, she has nurtured generations of scholars and sages as well as merchants and the occasional knave. In the shadow of its great castle lies Prague's Jewish Quarter-once so full of promise and hope, now rich only in memories and monuments. Hugo Gryn visits some of its most evocative sites, and recalls a world that is no more. Filmed six months before Prague's 1989 "velvet revolution", The Star, The Castle & The Butterfly highlights a lasting legacy of spirituality and beauty.
