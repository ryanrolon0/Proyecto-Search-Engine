The Gentleman from Texas

 Wells Fargo sends Johnny Macklin to Rimrock to investigate stage hold-ups and general lawlessness which, according to local agent Tom Jamieson is caused by saloon owner Steve Corbin and his henchmen Duke Sprague and Ace Jenkins. When Steve kills a man he had cheated in a poker game, the Rimrock Chronicle, owned by Idaho Jim Foster and edited by his daughter, Diane, starts a vigilante movement to clean up the town. Jamieson, also the mayor, swears Johnny in as the town marshal. Johnny lets henchman Slats Harper overhear information about a fictitious gold shipment, and traps some of Steve's men when they attempt a hold-up. Steve packs the jury and his men are set free. Saloon singer Kitty Malone, who is in love with Steve, becomes jealous of Flo Vickers, and warns Johnny that three gunmen have been imported to kill him. Flo tells Steve that Kitty is an informant, and Steve plans a double murder of Kitty and Johnny.
