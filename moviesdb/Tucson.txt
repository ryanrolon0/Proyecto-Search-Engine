Tucson

 Andy Bryant is a University of Arizona student. His grades suffer however because of his preoccupation with an upcoming intercollegiate rodeo. And he is in love with the blond Laurie Sherman. Tod Bryant, Andy's father, is more interested in embarrassing a rival at the rodeo than he is with his son's academic progress. When his lack of focus nearly causes a tragic accident in the university chemistry lab, Andy decides to hunker down and study.
