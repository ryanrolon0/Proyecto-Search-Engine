The Belt

 Usually there are many ways to tackle a problem. A car driver advises the gentle approach when his passenger pulls and pulls and pulls, but his seatbelt just refuses to come out. He should take a deep breath and then try again, thinks the driver. But whatever is tried, the belt remains as stubborn as a mule. The driver now takes the chance to show how things needs to be done. He bends over and tries his nice and smooth approach. How long before he changes methods and frustration shows it's evil face?
