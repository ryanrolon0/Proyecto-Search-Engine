The Covenant

 Out of the commune and Jesus movements of the 1960s came the Twelve Tribes of Israel, a communal living organization that sees Christian discipleship as requiring the abandonment of all things of the material world. As this group grows throughout the world they have begun to be referred to as a cult by religious officials, those working in the government, and family members of those who have gone in. Ithaca, New York houses one of these communities, and inside it there are people whose commitment will defy any preconceptions. This is maintained by the authority of Yedidyah in this community, and challenged by Cheryl, and mentally disabled woman who says she was manipulated by them when they forced her to make a Covenant.
