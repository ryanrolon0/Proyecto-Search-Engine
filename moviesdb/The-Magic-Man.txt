The Magic Man

 Hoping to secure fame and fortune, a struggling vaudeville magician turns to the dark arts. But the power unleashed could cost him the one thing he truly loves. 'The Magic Man' blends the artistry of black and white silent films of the 1920s with beautifully rendered visual effects to create a unique 3D experience.
