Saturday Evening Puss

 Mammy's stepping out for the evening (to play cards, as it turns out). While she's way, the cats will play alley cat friends. Their music keeps Jerry awake, so he takes action. His first strike silences them only long enough for him to return to his hole. They lure him out by restarting the music, and the chase is on against one. Jerry holds out for a while, but is soon tied with the cord from the venetian blinds, and the cats resume. Jerry manages to crawl to the phone and call Mammy, who comes running and throws all four cats out. But Jerry's peace is short-lived the evening by listening to some music. While Mammy Two-Shoes, bedecked in gaudy costume jewelry, enjoys her evening with the Lucky Seven Saturday Night Bridge Club, Tom and his alley cat friends have a party in the house. Meathead, the orange cat with a bandaged tail, puts on a chef's hat and serves up the record albums with a spatula. Butch, the black cat, plays the piano. Topsy, the little gray cat with a garbage can lid for a hat, plays the wine glasses with spoons. Jerry, unable to sleep from all the noise, emerges from his mouse hole to stop it. The cats put up a fight, but Jerry knows who to call for reinforcements.
