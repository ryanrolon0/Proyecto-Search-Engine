Timothy Feathergrass

 Good-natured, affable Timothy Feathergrass has spent 10 years building a satellite that he can't afford to launch without selling his prize possession When Timothy's bullying older brother Greg steals the shirt to impress the bewitching and Machiavellian Bree Dorris, Timothy plots to reacquire it with the help of Tessa, a compassionate, New Age saleslady. But will the price Timothy has to pay be too steep?
