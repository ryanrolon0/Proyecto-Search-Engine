Seker

 Based on the life experience of the director's mother, who, by an unexpected but not so rare turn of events, was brought up as a son by a father who wanted his first child to be a boy as tradition in the countryside family demands. Only when our protagonist Seker approaches the age of adolescence does she face a mandate from the local school dress or don't return. So finally gaining her father's permission she turns from a fist-fighting boy into a blossoming young girl.
