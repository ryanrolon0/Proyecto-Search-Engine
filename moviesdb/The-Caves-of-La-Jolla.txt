The Caves of La Jolla

 Many beautiful pictures have been made by foreign manufactures of picturesque places in their own country, but none of them surpass the natural beauty and rugged grandeur of our own West. The American Company, bearing in mind that very few pictures of this class have been produced for the pleasure and instruction of the American public, have produced a marvelous picture of the "Caves of La Jolla," that is stereoscopic in photography, magnificent in perceptive, sublime in grandeur, and faultless in every respect. The splendid vista unfolds itself to the spectator, as if he were looking upon the actual scene himself.
