The Accidental Tourist

 The Accidental Tourist is a witty four-minute film with a sting in the tail. The story is set in a seedy local bar, unchanged since the 1970s, in an unnamed town in the east of Scotland. It is about language, accent and understanding - or misunderstanding. It is also about prejudice and false expectation, and many of us will recognize ourselves in one or more of the characters. This is a highly crafted piece of work, with sumptuous Rembrandtesque cinematography, clever if understated visual effects and tight direction that sets exactly the right pace for the mood of the narrative.
