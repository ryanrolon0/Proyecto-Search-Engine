USS Cooper

 USS Cooper Return to Ormoc Bay is a documentary about a daring world record scuba dive to a sunken ship that is witnessed by a man who nearly perished on that same ship over sixty years ago. Traveling to dangerous depths, this film takes the time to remember fallen heroes, honor comrades and acknowledge those who made great sacrifices. The film explores the state of tragedy, the incomprehension we face when confronted with great, unspeakable loss. It also soars, touches the ineffable, and conveys promise. And in this balance, the film possesses great wit and humor. It opens, it reveals. It is a dark and deeply buoyant film. USS Cooper Return to Ormoc Bay is a documentary intertwining the past with the present by revisiting the tragedy of an American battleship that was torpedoed during World War II. The film features Rob Lalumiere's record-breaking 193-meter dive to place a memorial plaque on the shipwreck.
