Safe by My Side

 Shot on location in Ecuador with non-actors who lived through similar experiences, Safe By My Side follows Sergio and his younger brother Micos as they survive on the edge of poverty in the pristine jungles of the upper Amazon. Faced with separation by adoption, Sergio takes his brother on a journey through the Andes mountains to stay together. They quickly learn that life on the city streets might tear them apart more quickly than anything they feared in the jungle.
