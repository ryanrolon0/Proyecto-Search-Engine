Waves Across the Seaway

 A portrait of Native American Mohawk deejays at a Mohawk radio station near Montreal. Waves is a story told with attitude and humor, a film where wrestling, hip-hop, jazz and radio bingo meet to tell a story of contemporary Indians. Shot over a period of three years in a 'cinema verite' style that offers a unique sense of intimacy with the characters.
