 A heavy smoker leaves his house one day to pick up a pack of cigarettes. He is accosted by a group of militant anti-smokers, who pursue him to his house. From there things turn truly nightmarish as his jaw rots off from cancer, leaving him horribly disfigured. The mob finds break into the house, and forces the man into becoming the mascot for a popular anti-smoking campaign.
