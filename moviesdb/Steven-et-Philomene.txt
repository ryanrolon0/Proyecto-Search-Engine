Steven et Philomene

 In a post-rock, post-modern, post-everything environment, a rock band has been created, taht goes back to the primal state of things. The singer, Steven, has been entirely raised by the record company Named after Mister Trick, important business man. His son and wife live in total self-sufficiency, in a castle in which he lives too, here and then, without feeling that it's home. Since he was born, Steven has never seen his own reflection, has never seen a real human being (other than on TV, that is) and has never had access to words. He plays the part of a detonator, for everything we know will disappear as soon as he comes out, and something new will rise out of it.
