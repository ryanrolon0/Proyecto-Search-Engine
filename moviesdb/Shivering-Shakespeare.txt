Shivering Shakespeare

 The gang is participating in a program sponsored by the Golden Age Dramatic League. They present their own fractured version of _Quo Vadis (1927)_ (qv). Things go from bad to worse when the neighborhood tough kids disrupt the show. The pie fight is given a new twist by use of some slow motion sequences.
