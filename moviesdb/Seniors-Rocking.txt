Seniors Rocking

 A short film about the creation of the performance piece that the American dance pioneer Anna Halprin created with senior citizens from all walks of life at the Redwood Retirement Center in Marin County, California. This cinematic portrait shows Anna Halprin -- who helped redefine our notion of modern art with her belief in dance's power to teach, heal and transform -- working with seniors to help express their legacies through this performance, from the initial rehearsals to the culminating dance when participants get up from their rocking chairs and dance together in joyful celebration.
