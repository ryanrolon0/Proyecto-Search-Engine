Run of the Havana Fire Department

 "The primitive fire apparatus in use in Havana seems very amusing to one accustomed to the splendid machines in the larger American cities. This picture, taken on one of the principal streets of Havana, not only shows the various pieces of apparatus of the local fire department, but in the crowds which line the streets gives a good idea of the character of the people."
