The Business

 Set in the Thatcher era with the cool sounds of the 80's, THE BUSINESS is an action packed gangster flick set in Spain's sun drenched Costa Del crime. Frankie (Danny Dyer), is on the run from the high-rise's of South London to a new life in Malaga with nothing but a tin stuffed full of cash. Having no idea that this delivery of cash to super-suave playboy and ex-con, Charlie (Tamer Hassan), will change his life forever, he soon becomes one of the gang, and finds himself drawn into a flamboyant and violent world of organized crime. Frankie, a young lad on the run from the grimy ghetto of South London, plans his escape and the beginnings of a new life in sunny Spain - the Costa Del Sol to be more precise. Armed with nothing but a bundle of cash stashed in his luggage he heads off, yet Frankie has no idea that this sum of money will catapult him into the seductive world of ex-gangster Charlie. Before he knows it Frankie's got more then he bargained for - he's one of Charlie's gang and slap bang in the middle of the heady world of organized crime.
