The Comic Book Kids

 Two stories (Joseph Campanella) is the boss of Bonnix Comics. Marvin is his frustrated cartoonist and Carry and Skeets are two bright kids who have befriended Fantos, the Comic Book Wizard. Fantos has given them magic belts with transporter rings. With a pull of the rings - POW - the kids are instantly in the comic strip scenes created by Marvin.
