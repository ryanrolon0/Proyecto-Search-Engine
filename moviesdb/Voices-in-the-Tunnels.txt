Voices in the Tunnels

 New York is one of the most dynamic and fastest paced cities in the world, with a complex structure representing all layers of society.

As with any other society, this one too has a code of conduct and dictates of ethics that places theft from other underground dwellers as a more serious crime than murder - After all, when you have so little, what you do have is priceless. Six years after the first real evidence of these underground dwellers was revealed in Jennifer Toths' book "The Mole People", our film continues where she left off ...
