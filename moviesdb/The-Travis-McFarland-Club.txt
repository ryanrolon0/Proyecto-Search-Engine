The Travis McFarland Club

 Beautiful, dreamy eyed Sadie can't escape the loving memory of her deceased grade-school boyfriend. The sparsely attended support group she formed in his honor -The Travis McFarland Club- has isolated her from the world. But now Sadie's insular life is turned upside down when her sardonic sister reintroduces her to the cruel dating scene, and the Club throws Travis the eleventh birthday party he never had. Can Sadie, with the help of a wacky former teacher and Travis's Sadie-smitten best friend, put childhood behind her and discover true love?
