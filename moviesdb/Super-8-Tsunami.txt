Super 8 Tsunami

 A fictive portrait of a mythical island and the impact of a massive tsunami upon its inhabitants. A family of gifted puppet makers are forced to perform for the opening night of the ruling Raja's private theater. Life is hard on the island as most villagers work for the Raja who is a bitter, stingy and selfish man. Things take a turn for the worse when the Raja falls in love with one of the puppets featured in the opening performance. As the Raja witnesses a kiss from the puppet toward her lover, he wreaks havoc in the palace threatening to behead just about everybody. As the family of puppet makers scramble to make their get-away, the tears of Shiva create a massive tsunami that strikes the island, destroying much of the population as well as causing a breakdown of the oligarchy. Hard lessons are learned as the island is rebuilt yet cause for celebration is found in themes of forgiveness, resistance, determination and empathy.
