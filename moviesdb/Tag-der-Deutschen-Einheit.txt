Tag der Deutschen Einheit

 A typical Berlin-Kreuzberg story, where East meets West takes on a whole new meaning....A lost dog can start a huge diplomatic crisis. Two unemployed Turkish guys, both called Mehmet, hang around the streets of Kreuzberg all the time and suddenly get involved in a comic situation after simultaneously coming across a notice advertising a reward for a missing dog AND a dog that looks very similar to the missing one.
