The Fighting Peacemaker

 "Peace River" Parker is returning to his home range after serving time for a crime he did not commit. Riding a freight-car he meets a tramp named Hanna, whom he tells he is going home to his girl and his dog, the girl having promised to wait for him. Hanna tells him "Dogs remember, women do not." The rest of the journey, to Chinook, is made by stagecoach, where Parker takes the reins after replacing the drunken stagecoach driver. Hayes, a passenger, sits bedside Parker in the guard's seat, and relates some gossip that Jessie Marshall, Parker's girlfriend, has gotten engaged. The disenchanted Parker takes a job as a lowly sheepherder but balks when he learns he is to drive some sheep into the Chinook area. Chinook has always been cattle country. Parker decides to investigate.
