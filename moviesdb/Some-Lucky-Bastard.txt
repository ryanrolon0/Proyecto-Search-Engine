Some Lucky Bastard

 "What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?" When Chris Miller is given the task of running the office lotto pool he soon discovers that it affords him the opportunity (and the excuse) to talk to co-worker Tanya Nichols twice a week. But when she unexpectedly asks him out to dinner one day, the financially strapped Chris is forced to make a decision that could end up costing him more than the price of dinner.
