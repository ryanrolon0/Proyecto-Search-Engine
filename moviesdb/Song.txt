Song

 The plot of Song emerges from the mouth of a small boy as if he is singing his own future. The story leaps forward to a time when the singer, now a young thug, is in a rundown karaoke bar, apparently waiting for some sort of violent showdown. A timid university student enters the bar, coerced by his bossy girlfriend, and is confronted by the thug with hair raising results.
