Tivoli-Revyen 1988

 Taped during the summer of 1988, this is a television presentation of the annual revue in Copenhagen's amusement park Tivoli. The show is of humourous and musical character and stars some of the finest show actors of its time. Performances include, chronlogically a politician about the people's irresponsibleness, a praising of modern kitchen technology, a social-minded elegy, a colorful photographer, a nostalgic act about variety dancers, a melancholic song about being an old gay man, a parodic group-together of Hitler, Napoleon and Egon Olsen (from film-series Olsen-Banden), a song of praise for Copenhagen, a comedic text on sperm donation, and a couple of finishing performances which talk about the Tivoli-Revy as a concept and related popular culture.
