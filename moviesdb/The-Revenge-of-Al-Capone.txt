The Revenge of Al Capone

 Al Capone's been convicted of tax evasion, but the law states that he can only be confined to a regular jail cell. And from there, he still runs his criminal empire. Michael Rourke, a government agent, who is aware of this, seeks to have him transfered to the newly open maximum security prison, Alcatraz, but nobody believes that this is necessary.
