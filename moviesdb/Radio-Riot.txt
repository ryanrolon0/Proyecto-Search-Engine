Radio Riot

 The phenomenon of radio is hot, and everyone is listening. A frog announcer introduces the "Daily Exercise Hour". In at least one home, the radio itself performs the exercises, and so do an end table and a goldfish. A spider starts out his morning with an exercise program, too, which provides an energetic start to his day, even though he doesn't need it shower and a hearty breakfast, he goes right back to bed. Two mice listen to the program while pulling a sleeping cat's whiskers in order to strengthen their arm muscles. Next are the music programs. Houseflies on flypaper sing as two dogs with a saw and a cello, and a pig with a trumpet, provide the back-up. Birds dance on the radio wires. An anthropomorphic apartment building dances, too. At night, it's time for a horrific bedtime story. Three mouse-children listen in terror.
