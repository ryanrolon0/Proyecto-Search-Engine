Vitamin Hay

 Hunky and Spunky are in the barn ready to eat their noon-day meal and, while Spunky is hungry, he refuses to eat any hay that has vitamins in it. His mother, in order to tempt him, places a lump of sugar deep within the hay, but Spunky eats around the hay to get to the sugar. He wanders off and sees a goat nibbling on a car-fender, but he has no success when he tries it, so he chews on the car's horn. It breaks off gets down his throat and begins honking. A lady goose is attracted by the noise but her gander boyfriend also shows up irritated at what he considers an imitation of his own sound. Spunky's mother has to rescue him from the goose.
