Under the Hula Moon

 In the desert outside Cactus Gulch, Arizona, Buzzard and Betty Jean Wall live in a trailer decorated in Hawaiian themes. Betty's trying to get pregnant. Buzz wants to market "Cammo," a sun block lotion that looks like camouflage; but financing is tough to find and Betty thinks he should get a real job. Buzz's half-brother Turkey, a murderous psychopath, escapes from jail, comes to the trailer, ties up Buzz, kidnaps Betty, steals $10,000 they've just won from Publisher's Clearing Hut's Lucky Loser drawing, and heads for Mexico. Buzz is untied by Maya, an ex-girlfriend who's now a TV reporter in search of a story. They pick up Turk's trail and set out to rescue Betty.
