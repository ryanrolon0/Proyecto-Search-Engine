The Odyssey

 The film consists of 24 continuous shorts by 24 groups of filmmakers telling the complete story of THE ODYSSEY, Homer's epic in 24 chapters. The story begins at the end of a war, the invasion of Troy by the Greeks, and chronicles the 10-year journey home of one warrior, Odysseus. Having offended Poseidon, the God of the Sea, Odysseus is thwarted at every turn in his voyage, and even passes through the realm of the dead before reaching Ithaka, his kingdom. The epic hints at what it might mean to travel to wage war, to then try to return to the point of departure, and to have both left behind and carried home chaos.
