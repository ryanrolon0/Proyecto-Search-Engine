Trouble on the Corner

 Jeff Steward, a psychologist, takes good care of his patients mostly living in the same apartment. One day a piece of the bathroom ceiling collapses so he can watch the woman living in the upper apartment taking a bath. This causes total disorder of his normal life and he starts mixing the patients' psychoses up with his own.
