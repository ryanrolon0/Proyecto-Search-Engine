The Navajo Riders

 In the 2008 Navajo Nation Council Horse Ride the council delegates ride to different parts of the Navajo Nation to learn about the needs and concerns of the Navajo people at town hall meetings at chapter houses, the same way as their ancestors did. Chapter houses are the local form of government. The seven-day horseback ride covers 3 states and 510 miles through the Navajo Nation. This amazing journey takes us through the Navajo Volcanic Field, narrow canyons, high mountain passes, and desert land where we will see wild mustangs, dinosaur tracks, and ancient Anazasi structures built over thousands of years ago. This is an open window to the Navajo culture. Listen to one of the original Navajo code talkers share his experiences two weeks before his passing and learn about the efforts of the Navajo people to keep their traditions and culture alive.
