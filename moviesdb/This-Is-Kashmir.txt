This Is Kashmir

 In 2009 the New Zealand Ski Club of Kashmir put the call out for ski and snowboard instructors to volunteer for a once in a lifetime opportunity. This was to travel to Gulmarg, India in the disputed region of Kashmir and teach local kids how to ski. Gulmarg, the location of the world's highest Gondola, attracts adventure skiers from around the world to sample backcountry skiing on a Himalayan scale. 8 Instructors form Australia, New Zealand, UK, Argentina and France answered the call of the ski club and came to Gulmarg for 2 months of teaching and skiing. This is their story.
