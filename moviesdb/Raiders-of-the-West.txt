Raiders of the West

 Two entertaines hired by an outlaw gang leader are really range detectives. Before they can arrest the gang, they are found out and captured. Their partner must find a way to rescue them before they are murdered. The Frontier Marshals have been called in to try and break up a counterfeiting operation. Phony bills received at their horse auction leads them to Duke Mallory's dude ranch. Mallory holds an engraver prisoner and gets rid of the fake bills by having three of his cronies become big winners at his gambling tables. Lee Powell tries to become Mallory's partner to get evidence but is made a prisoner when his true identity becomes known.
