The Sublimation Experiment

 The Sublimation Experiment is not a story of big name pros, but a story of people who are devoted to the sport and to the mountains and who struggle to make it work, just like you and me. It is an experiment that follows the lives of a handful of individuals throughout two epic winters as they showcase their skills while trying to sustain a lifestyle that is founded upon a common passion.
