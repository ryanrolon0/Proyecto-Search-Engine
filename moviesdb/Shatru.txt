Shatru

 Inspector Ashok Sharma is assigned to take over as Inspector In-Charge of a remote police station, which he does. Upon his arrival there, he comes to the rescue of a blind man and a widow, and has a fist fight with Nishikant Shah and his men. The next day, Shah finds out that the person his men fought with is no other than the new Inspector In-charge, and he goes to pay homage, but Ashok refuses. Then Shah and the local MLA spin a web of lies and deceit, in which Ashok is accused of killing a man in custody, and as a result he may face criminal charges and also lose his job.
