Storming the Fort

 "This is a snowball fight between two classes of youngsters from the Watertown Y.M.C.A. Gymnasium. They had been anticipating the contest for days and went into the fight with a great deal of spirit. One class defends a temporary fortification at the base of the Soldiers' Monument; the other class forming a storming party."
