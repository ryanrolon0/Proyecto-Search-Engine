Running Mates

 Main opponents at the mayor's election in Nashville are the middle-class Jones and rich Adams. Their children, 21 years old Thommy Lee and 17 years old Elisabeth Adams, meet each other in a bar and are immediately sympathetic. But when her father sees him on a party of her's, he almost throws him out - afraid of being spied on - and later prohibits her any further contact. The two continue meeting nevertheless and develop a romantic relationship. But they can't keep it secret for very long and eventually get drawn into an intrigue against Elizabeth's father.
