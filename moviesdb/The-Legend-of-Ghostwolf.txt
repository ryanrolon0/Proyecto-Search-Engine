The Legend of Ghostwolf

 A dark legend unfolds through the vivid recollections of an old wanderer who recounts a forgotten Indian legend and the story of Jalisco, a Mexican running with a band of renegade soldiers in the post-Civil War era. Obsessed with finding Confederate gold, Jalisco and companions learn, instead, the high cost of greed from the terrifying guardian of the Tonkawa gold mine.
