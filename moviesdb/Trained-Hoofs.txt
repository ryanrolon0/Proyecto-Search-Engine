Trained Hoofs

 The lives of such famed race horses as 'Sir Galahad III' (qv), 'Crusader' (qv), and 'Man o' War' (qv) do not end after their racing days are over, but rather they become the parents and grandparents possibly of future race horse stars. This parentage provides a jump start to what is the inexact science of breeding race horses. Colts and foals are given their racing start by running, only as recreation, with their mother or father. But the best laid plans for these colts and foals can be derailed by disease and injury. At twenty months of age, training starts in earnest, which includes the horse getting used to carrying weight on its back. Other things the horse must get used to is running around a track, getting penned in the starting gate and starting to gallop at the sound of the starting bell. This MGM Miniature shows how a newly-foaled thoroughbred is trained to be a racehorse in the first 15 months of life. There are also brief glimpses of racing champions 'Man o' War' (qv), 'Crusader' (qv), and 'Sir Galahad III' (qv) at a stud farm.
