Trade In

 A car dealer who needs to raise money by the end of the month to stay in business, so he rents out the back of his dealership to a movie company, not knowing that the movie is a porn. That revelation comes at the most inopportune time, as the dealership is holding a big family day and the porn spills out onto the event. A variety of quirky characters make up the dealership sales staff, which complicates the efforts of the beautiful marketing expert who arrives to help generate sales, and ends up finding a mutual romantic interest with the dealership owner. Marty, owner of the Car Kingdom, is thrust into a sales contest against his bitter rival, Wayne Empire of Empire Cars. Desperate, Marty brings in help in the form of the beautiful marketing rep Gina - who also happens to be Marty's ex-girlfriend. Together, they work to focus Marty's group of misfits sales team and turn them into the top car dealership in town; while Wayne goes to his own extreme and ridiculous lengths to get Marty's doors shut forever. It's a battle of wit, and bumbling whim to determine just who gets to stay open, and who gets traded in.
