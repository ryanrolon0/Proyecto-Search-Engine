Sveti Ivan Rilski

 This film is about the life and spiritual exploit of the Reverend St Ivan of Rila, hermit in the Rila Mountain and performer of miracles. Praying for Bulgarian to the radiant God Almighty, the saint was an actual protector-angel and patron of the long-suffering Bulgarian people. The life of St Ivan of Rila and the story of the monastery he founded in the 10th century are told using a Holy Mass ritual as departure point.
