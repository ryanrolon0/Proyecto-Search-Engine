The Guest at Central Park West

 African-American Professor Charles Watts is no longer safe in his own home. Every phone call is a potential death threat. Every stranger, a potential enemy. Still, tonight he is celebrating. After receiving the Nobel Prize for his pacifist book, The Eyes of Peace, Charles and his wife, Nina, are going forward with a dinner party in honor of Charles' achievement. That is until an unexpected guest arrives at this Central Park West address - Terrence Barlow. Terrence is a homeless drifter with a scintillating mind, a violent disposition and a long and mysterious history with Charles.Terrence exposes a different side of the peace loving Charles, and the future of all the guests will be forever changed.
