The Cinematographer

 A profile of and salute to the cinematographer on the set, his background and apprenticeship, his tools, and his artistry. The cinematographer is responsible for how things in a movie will look make up and costumes are done to anticipate his work. We look at his tools cameras, lenses and filters, equipment for tracking shots, and lights. He's responsible for 1001 elements, a team of artisans, and, most important, how light will enhance a film's mood and characterizations. The short closes with a look at difficult shots from scaffolding.
