The Unknown Man

 Prominent attorney Brad Mason takes on the defense of Rudi Walchek, a young hit-man hoodlum accused of murder. Convinced of the youthful thug's innocence, Mason get him acquitted. Later, he learns from the murder-victim's father that Walchek is a low-level member of a protection-racket gang and was undoubtedly guilty. Mason is anxious to get the gang-leader, but when he discovers it is the eminently respected head of the city's Crime Commission, he feels that a conviction in a court-of-law would be impossible. In a rage, he kills the man, but all evidence, including the murder weapon points to Walchek. When the latter is again brought to trial, Mason, although he senses a higher justice is at work, feels he must defend him with the best of his ability. Organized crime boss Rudi Wallchek is accused of murder and defended by prominent attorney Dwight Mason. After Wallchek is acquitted, he admits to Mason that he was, indeed, the murderer. When the chairman of the local crime commission is murdered, Wallchek is again accused. Attorney Mason sets in motion a series of events that assures justice will be served.
