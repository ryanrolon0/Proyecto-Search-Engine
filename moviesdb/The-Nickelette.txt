The Nickelette

 This short film recreates the experience of watching films shown during the silent era in what were called nickelettes, since admission for an evening's entertainment cost five cents. The newsreels presented include New Yorkers going speed crazy in being able to travel seven miles in three hours, and a race between a motor vehicle and an airplane. Following is one of the features, _The Wonderful Chance (1920)_ (qv), which starred 'Rudolph Valentino' (qv) in one of his earliest roles, but in character not often portrayed by him, namely the gangster. A short commercial and a live musical interlude precede a second feature in which a dastardly villain abducts the helpless heroine, a secretary, who must be saved from doom by her boss. Throughout the evening's entertainment, the narrator providing the voice over has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek.
