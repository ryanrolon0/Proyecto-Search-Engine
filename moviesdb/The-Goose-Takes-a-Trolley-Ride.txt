The Goose Takes a Trolley Ride

 The picture opens showing the approach of a Philadelphia trolley car, known as refrigerator cars in winter. The car stops and a lady gets aboard. Just before the car starts, a farmer hops in. He carries a large goose in his hands, with the wings fluttering. The car starts and we see the interior, where a number of those horrid men are sitting reading newspapers. One of them gives a pretty girl his seat, but the homely one (as usual) is allowed to stand. She is loaded down with boxes and bundles, as though she had been shopping. She sways from side to side, but the men are apparently blind, until she steps on the foot of one of them, when he limps out of the car. She is about to sit down, when the farmer with the goose bumps into her and she loses her grip on her bundles, which fly in all directions. Rising in her wrath, she seizes one of her bundles, which contains flour, and beats the farmer unmercifully. The car stops, the conductor pitches the fighters out and they resume their fight on the sidewalk. The goose meanwhile hops away.
