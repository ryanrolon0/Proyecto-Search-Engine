Seafoam & Salmon

 Kate, a high school senior is ready to go off to college and get away from her home town. Tony, her neighbor, lives a lonely and uneventful life with his sick grandmother. Kate and Tony rarely talk, but their brief encounters and observances of each other offer comfort between the two strangers. The apartment offers a meeting for the two that enables both of them to move on.
