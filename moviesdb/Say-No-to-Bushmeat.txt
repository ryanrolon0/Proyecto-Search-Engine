Say No to Bushmeat

 Once a traditional way of life, bushmeat hunting in Ghana has evolved into a multi-million dollar industry that has driven several animal species to the brink of extinction. Using deadly techniques like chemical poison, bushfires and automatic weapons, hunters have become the leading cause of the "empty forest syndrome," the absence of wildlife in otherwise intact forests. The video, widely distributed in Ghana, was part of a successful countrywide awareness campaign to curb bushmeat consumption. Initial surveys indicate that bushmeat consumers in the capital have become aware of this alarming problem and are slowly choosing other alternatives.
