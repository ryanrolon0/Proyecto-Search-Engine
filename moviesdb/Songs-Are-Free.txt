Songs Are Free

 Historian, educator, composer, and vocalist Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon is interviewed by Bill Moyers. Interwoven with footage of her and Sweet Honey in the Rock's musical performances and seminars, she explains the history of Black America's tradition of communal singing, and its collective composition and repertoire of songs of resistance, pride, faith, and courage from the days of slavery through the end of the twentieth century. A musical, cultural, and historical journey for the viewer.
