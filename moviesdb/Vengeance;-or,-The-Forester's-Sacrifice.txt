Vengeance; or, The Forester's Sacrifice

 Evans, a forester, is seated one evening in his comfortable home as his young employer, Count Roberts, rushes in, explaining that he had just been assaulted by a poacher known as Black Jim. The forester has to leave immediately in search of the man, and as soon as he leaves his wife and Count Roberts embrace and kiss. They do not notice that the forester has been watching them. He determines to shoot Roberts and Black Jim agrees to aid him. The forester returns and reports that he can not find Black Jim, so the count decides to go out and look for him. The count's mother and his young wife seek to dissuade him, but are unsuccessful. The forester, feeling for the women, repents his scheme, and changes clothes with the count. A moment later a bullet goes through his brain. He is carried home, where his action if first understood.
