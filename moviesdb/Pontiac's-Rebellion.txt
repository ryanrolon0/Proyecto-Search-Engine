Pontiac's Rebellion

 In October 2008, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich announced that Pontiac Correctional Center (PCC) in Pontiac, Illinois was to close by the end of the year. Being the number two employer in Pontiac, PCC's closure would have devastated the community economically. 'Pontiac's Rebellion' chronicles the hardships surrounding the impending closure and the struggle to keep it open. Will their rebellion be in vain?
