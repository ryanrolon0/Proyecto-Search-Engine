The Thundering West

 Outlaws Dale and Tucson quit Wolf's gang. Just as the two are about to rob the stage, Wolf and his gang beat them to it. Dale breaks it up saving the money and this gets him appointed Sheriff. But Wolf shows up and threatening to expose Dale, forces him to let his gang rob the express office. A remake of "The Lone Rider-1930" and "The Man Trailer-1934" with Buck Jones and also 1932's "Texas Gun-Fighter" (correct spelling of title) with Ken Maynard, film opens with the Sons of the Pioneers performing during a celebration in the town of Oro Grande. Outlaw leader Wolf Munro leads his gang in a raid on the town, but Judge Patterson tells the citizens that the discovery of gold nearby will ensure that law and order will come, and that Wells Fargo is establishing headquarters in Oro Grande. Munro, in the gang hideout, proposes leaving behind a grizzled old-timer, Tucson, as the gang prepares to run from the pursuing posse. Laramie, aka Jim Dale, objects, splits from the gang and stays with Tucson. The old man tries to reform Jim, who wants to return to a decent life but feels it is too late. He decides to rob the stagecoach but Wolf's gang is there ahead of him. He drives them off, and the stage driver and passenger Helen Patterson, the judge's daughter, hail him as their rescuer, and Jim takes to coach to town. The Judge heads a committee to appoint Jim the new sheriff, which he reluctantly accepts but doesn't plan to stay. Later, Tucson and the Judge have become good friends, Jim and Helen fall in love, and Jim decides to make good as sheriff by ridding the territory of Wolf's gang. He admits his true identity to Judge Patterson, who says he knew along who he was, but knew he could reform and make good. His plans fall apart when the gang steals the gold from the express office and kidnap Jim when they leave. The townspeople, also now knowing of Jim's past, think he set up the robbery.
