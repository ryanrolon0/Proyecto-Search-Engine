Skylight

 On a quiet lakeside bench, an old man tries to inspire his young granddaughter to believe that magic truly does exist. He weaves the dark fable of two men, a diner owner and a cab driver, and the fateful night their two paths intertwined. One man brought a heart full of hope, the other brought a gun. With a single gunshot, their destinies changed forever.
