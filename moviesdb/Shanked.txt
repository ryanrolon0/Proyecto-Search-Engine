Shanked

 Sadistic producer, Vengeance, commissions a new kind of reality show, which he delightfully nicknames "snuff reality." Six people volunteer for what they think is a reality program filmed in the lap of luxury but find themselves in a dungeon. Hilarity ensues as the team, now larger due to the addition of the biracial half-twins already squatting in the dungeon, battles disease, the producers' challenges, starvation and a violent samurai.
