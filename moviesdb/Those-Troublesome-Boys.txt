Those Troublesome Boys

 A workingman is busy mixing cement in a door yard. Two small boys are watching the proceedings interestedly but are driven away by the workingman. They decide to get even with him and during an interim, while he is called away, they arrange a bucket of mortar on the end of a plank in such a manner that when the workingman returns and commences to pound the foundation of the walk he strikes the end of the plank and the pail of mortar flies in the air and the contents completely covers him much to the glee of the two youngsters.
