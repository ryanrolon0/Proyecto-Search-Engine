Surviving Me

 It is said in college, 'By junior year, the shit hits the fan,' and for Sophie Hoffkind it truly does. Refusing to face an emotional void left by her mother's use of Sophie's college money for her new baby, Sophie is drowning in tuition debt, a financial aid crisis, and loveless hook-ups. Luckily, Sophie's poetry professor Slateman takes a mentoring interest in her and introduces her to his wife, but Sophie takes their generosity too far. When an unexpected death occurs, Sophie spins totally out of control, desperately grasping for stability by using what's been working for her-- sex and lies. It isn't until her defenses fail her that Sophie is forced to confront herself with honest humility and begin to finally grow up.
