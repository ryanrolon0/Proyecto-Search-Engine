The Grid

 A group of ambitious college students are recruited into a clandestine experiment to test a mass-market artificial intelligence program. Like an all-knowing life coach, the system leads them to success beyond their wildest dreams... until the power of the technology proves dangerous and an innocent girl winds up dead. When Travis Lane, aka "Participant One," breaks ranks to expose the experiment, he is disgraced, blackmailed and threatened. With his own future and the future of the University at stake, Travis will have to bring down The Grid and its greedy creator in a final man-against-thinking-machine showdown.
