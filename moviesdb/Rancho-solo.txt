Rancho solo

 The film is a typical whodunit story, combined with a "ranchero" and western flavor. A young engineer arrives to his godfather hacienda, along with his fiancEe. But the things got complicated when the godfather's wife reveals that she had an affair with the young man. One night, the young man's father is murdered in the wood, and he will look for revenge.
