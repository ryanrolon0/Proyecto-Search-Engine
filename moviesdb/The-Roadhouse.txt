The Roadhouse

 Joe and Michelle Nuzzo have been married for exactly one year. On October 9th, they will celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary in misery, stranded at a decrepit motel in upstate New York after having car troubles while returning from Joe's fathers' funeral. The six hour trip already has the bitter couple growing frustrated. Now, with no where to go in the middle of the night, the couple tries to make due with the nerving and odd people they encounter.
