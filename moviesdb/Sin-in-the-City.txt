Sin in the City

 Three girls head from boarding school to NYC, arriving by bus at Port Authority and vowing to "get into trouble", not turning down any request. These "girls gone wild" forerunners head to a Greenwich Village bar where they copycat a girl stripping to dance topless atop the bar, then head to a Village party and finally crash a posh uptown party before catching the bus home.
