Sawaal

 Vikram Mehta alias Vicky is one of two children in the wealthy Mehta family. He has fallen in love with with Reshmi, who is the daughter of Shamsher Singh, his father's business associate, and both would like to get married. Sonia is the second child in the Mehta family, which also consists of Anju, her mom, and dad, Dhanpathrai. While both her mom and dad had agreed in a heartbeat to Reshmi's marriage with Vicky, they show considerable hesitation when Sonia introduces the young man she loves, Ravi Malhotra, who is employed as a Police Inspector. What Sonia does not know is that her dad is criminal don, along with Shamsher Singh, and they will never permit a man who works for the police to become their son-in-law. When Sonia persists, her parents give in, and again Sonia is kept in the dark - for Dhanpathrai has issued instructions to his men to kill Ravi - as he believes this is the only solution that will prevent Sonia from insisting on marrying him.
