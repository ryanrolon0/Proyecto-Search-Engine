The Ruined Eye

 Using his camera, John Remora systematically captures what entices him in the common world and uses it to build the VOID - a place unfinished, amassing human puppets and partial architecture. When a woman from John's past, Monica, enters the picture she tears a rift between John and his work. John can't help but be drawn to this new-found affection, threatening the only thing he's cared about so far
