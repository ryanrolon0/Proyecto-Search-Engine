Port of Missing Girls

 A woman framed for a murder she didn't commit stows away on a freighter headed for an island in the South Seas known as a hideout for people on the run from the law. The ship's radio operator finds her and falls in love with her, promising to help her get to the island. However, things take a turn for the worse when another couple recognize the woman, and as she is about to escape the ship she learns of a plot to rob the freighter and its crew.
