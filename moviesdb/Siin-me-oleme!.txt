Siin me oleme!

 On a nice summer day a funny little car rolls over a peaceful farm yard of Muhu island. the family that alrights from the vehicle is quite odd-looking mystical read-head. they announce that they want to spend their vacation in the farm ... "We are from capital, we will pay". This quiet vacation turns a frantic day with romance, unexpected turnes and fisticuffs between suitors.
