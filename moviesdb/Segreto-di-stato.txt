Segreto di stato

 A bomb blows up in Milan and five people die. After only three hours Ravida, the chief of the Secret Service, knows the name of the killer and that of his chief. It is Fossati enlisted in the same Secret Service. Judge Francesca Savona who has to investigate the case and is already investigating the Secret Service slush funds is not convinced by Ravida. She asks for the help of detective Carlo Tommasi who has the reputation of being an honest policeman and is able to get it from the Minister. In the meantime Fossati fled, warned by a call. The inquiry begins but the atmosphere is corrupt and it is difficult to tell friend from foe.
