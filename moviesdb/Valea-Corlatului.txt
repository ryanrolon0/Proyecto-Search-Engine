Valea Corlatului

 The counties of Brasov and Covasna are located in the very center of Romania. In Brasov, 87% inhabitants are ethnic Romanians. In Covasna, 76% inhabitants are ethnic Magyars. This is the story of a clandestine village, built right on the boundary between those two counties.  A place without electricity nor water supply with 700 people officially registered at one same house, other 200 people without any official address, and many children without hope of ever receiving an identity card.
