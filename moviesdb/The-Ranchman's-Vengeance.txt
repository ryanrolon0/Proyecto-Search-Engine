The Ranchman's Vengeance

 Lorenz Pedro, a Mexican half-breed, owns a small sheep ranch, and lives happily with his wife Marie and little daughter Lois. One exceedingly hot afternoon, Tom Flint, riding across the ranch looking for work is overcome by the heat, and Pedro, acting the part of a good Samaritan, takes him to his home, where Marie, through careful nursing, soon has him quite himself again. Pedro is out daily with his flock, leaving Marie and Flint together, offering an opportunity which Flint ungratefully takes advantage of, resulting in his completely winning Marie's love. Manuelito, Marie's father, is suspicious and comes upon them while Flint is declaring his love. He goes to Pedro in the field and tells what he has seen and heard. Hastening home he finds his wife in Flint's embrace, and in his great love for Marie bids Flint take her, but warns him his life shall pay the penalty should he ever find him shamefully abusing both mother and child. Manuelito sends a telegram to Pedro, who is working on a distant ranch, telling him of this abuse. Arriving home he comes upon Flint in the act of striking Marie, whose health having been undermined by ill treatment, at the sight of Pedro, falters for a moment, and falls dead at his feet. Flint is terror-stricken. At the point of a gun Pedro summarily marches him off to a high cliff overlooking the sea. Here Pedro tosses away his gun and a terrible hand-to-hand combat ensues, ending when Flint is thrown from the cliff to a watery grave. The death of Marie is avenged. A few days later little Lois prevents the grief-stricken Pedro from taking his own life, and clasping the little child in his arms, kneels in resignation by the mother's grave.
