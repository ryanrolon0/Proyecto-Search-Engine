Rose of Santa Rosa

 Angry because his father, Don Manuel Ortega (Fortunio Bonanova), had arranged a marriage with a girl he has never met, Dolores de Garfias (Patricia Barry as Patricia White), Ramon Ortega (Eduardo Noreiga), despite the threat of being disinherited, becomes an entertainer at a local night club. His father uses his influence and has the club closed. Ramon goes to Santa Rosa and helps a beautiful senorita, Rose, open her new night club, and falls in love with her. When his father arrives, Ramon learns that "his" Rose is the Dolores his father wanted him to marry in the first place.
