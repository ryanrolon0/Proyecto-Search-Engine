T-Bone for Two

 Pluto finds a bone - but also finds Butch the bulldog, who claims it for himself. Idea a large bone-shaped hole. Butch falls for it, and while he's digging deeper, Pluto almost makes off with the bone. Butch catches on just in time and chases Pluto, who ducks into a junkyard. The bone gets sucked into in a squeeze-bulb horn, which Pluto does battle with.
