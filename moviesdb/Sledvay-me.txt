 This is a road movie. Ivan and Maria meet at the roar accidentally. They are going in their separate directions - headed for their own problems, for their own worlds. Gradually, however, their separate ways turn out to have much in common. Being both dependent on their pasts, they now try to help each other so as to get through with their dependencies and start their life clearly, anew, from scratch.
