Simple

 Alfonso is an amateur filmmaker, in love with David (best friend of his best friend's girlfriend), and he writes him a screenplay so he could star in it. One day before shooting begins, his two best friends and even his own mind have strong opinions about his unrequited love, and they let him know, but what does Alfonso think? And, most importantly, what does David think? Love is full of clichEs simple.
