Soulmates

 Barry is a fledgling couples-therapist who unwittingly finds himself on a blind date with Claudina, a crazy old hag with a curiously over-active libido. After a strange series of paranormal events, Barry must rely on his shoddy couples-therapy skills in order to make it through the night with his body and soul intact.
