Qatil Jawani

 Widower Shamji lives a wealthy lifestyle in Southern India along with his son, Arun, and owns a private college named after his deceased wife, Nirmala. When Arun comes of age, he arranges his marriage with Singapore-based Archana, the daughter of his widower friend, Ketan Sharma. Arun and Archana meet and approve of each other, and shortly thereafter both get married. On the night of the marriage, their house gets broken into by an unknown male who wants to rob Archana's gold and jewelry. When Arun tries to stop him, a scuffle ensues, Arun gets stabbed and is killed. Archana dons the garb of a widow and Shamji permits her to run the college. Shortly thereafter four outstanding male students go missing one by one. Their overly anxious parents approach Archana, who in turn asks the local police for assistance. The question remains where are the four students, and how and why did they disappear?
