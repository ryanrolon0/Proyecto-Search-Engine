The Healing Project

 The Healing Project is a medical docucomedy about a cardiac research team who gets sidetracked from their daily routine during a bet between two doctors, one a skeptic and the other more spiritual. Their bet scientifically challenges the effectiveness of spiritual healing. In an effort to devote more time to his two passions, sailing and getting laid, Dr. Manning makes a bet with his boss, Dr. Bennett, that will scientifically test spiritual healing. Manning thinks it will be easy to debunk the ancient healing practices of the Native Americans, but he's in for a surprise. Bennett uncovers powerful evidence that proves many Native American healing rituals stand up to scientific scrutiny. Western science has even adopted some of their remedies. Manning realizes he's about to lose the bet, so he turns on the charm and convinces their research coordinator, Jeannie, to come up with research that contradicts Bennett's sources. Both doctors prove their points. In the end, the viewer decides who won the bet.
