The People vs. Dan White

 In 1978, former San Francisco supervisor Dan White went on a rampage in City Hall, shooting and killing Mayor George Moscone and ex-Board of supervisors colleague Harvey Milk. Events leading up to the killings. White's trial and its controversial aftermath (he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to a short prison term) are probed in this docudrama, adapted from Steve Dobbins' play 'The Dan White Incident.'
