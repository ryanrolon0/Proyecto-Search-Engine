Postcard from Harbin

 Scenes, surfaces, movement, light, and pulsations captured on video in Harbin, China. A dense, slowly morphing translucent curtain of visual counterpoint. Images dissolve on, live their brief life on the screen, and imperceptibly dissolve off, only to be replaced a new layer of imagery and sensations.
