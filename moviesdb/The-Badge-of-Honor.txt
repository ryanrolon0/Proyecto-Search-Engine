The Badge of Honor

 The cowardly sheriff, shrinking from the task of trailing a desperate bandit, captures a poor innocent tramp, whom he represents before the infuriated villagers as the much-wanted outlaw, but a valiant girl turns the tables upon her detested suitor, thereby winning for her lover, a deputy sheriff, the badge of honor. Margy's parents favor the sheriff, but she loves the deputy. Therefore whenever the sheriff catches them spooning he always orders the deputy off to some task. Such is the case when the villagers, exasperated at being constantly terrorized by Red Pete, admonish the sheriff that he will be replaced unless he captures the bandit. The sheriff, his prestige at stake, ventures forth upon the bandit's "sure death" warning. Of course, he sends his deputy, who after a diligent search, returns empty-handed. The sheriff again orders his deputy off, this time with instructions not to return alive without the bandit. Thanks to Margy's valuable aid, the deputy does capture Red Pete. Meanwhile, however, the sheriff is cheered and congratulated for his bravery - but wait - Margy and the deputy are now nearing the village with the real bandit. It is apparent that the sheriff attempted to steal undeserved credit and he promptly loses his laurels. The prowess of the deputy is lauded vociferously to the great delight of Margy and the dismay of Sheriff Mercer.
