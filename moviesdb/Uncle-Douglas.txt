Uncle Douglas

 A Christmas story about family. Douglas and his wife Pat descend on the family of Douglas's dead sister to pay a sour call at Christmas. The widower, Barry, is sweet and courteous as Douglas bullies him and Pat tries unsuccessfully to soften her husband. While Barry goes into the garden to tend to his goat (a gift from his dead wife), Barry shoos his niece Sarah into the kitchen with Pat while he has a man-to-man talk with his nephew Michael. Seems he believes Michael is gay. That conversation over, Douglas and Pat take their leave; Pat discloses something to Douglas in the car, while the family returns to its normal pursuits. Is anything as it seems?
