Somun shibi bang

 The twelve animals representing the Chinese zodiac (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, horse, snake, dragon, rooster, monkey, dog, boar, and ram) exist as half-man, half-beast heroes. Led by the dragon, they attempt to defeat the whale, ruler of the sea, and his evil legions and to maintain balance in the universe.
