So Beauty

 From the sly villain to the noble sidekick; from the wise sage to the overachieving student, Asian males have long been confined to secondary roles in Hollywood. Alongside their Caucasian counterparts, they would aid in battle, work to solve the mystery, help to save the day, and often times stand by only to watch the other guys get the girls...until now. So Beauty, a comedy that follows four Asian friends in their separate quests for romance, opens the window into the mind of Asian men and their outlook on dating.
