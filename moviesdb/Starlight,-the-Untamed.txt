Starlight, the Untamed

 Young Jack Barham's life had been soft and easy and one of luxury - divided between riding horses and lolling on the veranda drinking milt juleps in the shade. Suddenly, old Colonel Barham passed away and Jack found he was no longer rich. He sold what remained at auction and headed for the wide open spaces of Texas to start a new life. There he met Madge Carter, the dainty daughter of a rancher and thought things were looking up. Then the mare on Carter's ranch turned up missing and, Starlight, the wild-horse that Jack had caught and tamed was accused of leading the mares astray. Jack suspected that two-legged varmits called rustlers were most likely the culprits, and set out to prove it.
