The Model Maker

 An old man is quietly consumed by memories of war, and despairing the loss of his closest friends, slowly completes an effigy to them just before his life slips away. A poetic and stylish exploration of dreams, with glimpses into the tragic events of the past, the film captures the yearning we feel to be with and honor those we have lost.
