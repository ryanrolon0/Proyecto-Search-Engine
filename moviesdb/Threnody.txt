 In the near future, the NAU (North American Union) has replaced the nations of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The ruling totalitarian super-government has seized power under the guise of 'saving the planet' (via 'protecting the environment'), and in doing so has shut down all dissenting voices, labeling them 'hate speech.' A 'nutrient pill' is regularly distributed to citizens...a pill full of toxins that causes fatigue to anyone who takes it. Frank Galloway has recently lost his young wife, Sarah, after she was picked up for distributing anti- government propaganda. With the help of a CNS (Civilian National Security) officer, Frank attempts to resurrect AM radio in order to spread the word about the pill...if the withdrawal symptoms don't kill him first.
