Sin-Jin Smyth

 Every Halloween at midnight, The Devil simultaneously appears in two places...the high plains of India, and a quiet cemetery in Kansas. On November 2nd, 'The Day of the Dead', two Federal Marshals report to the small town of Shin Bone, Kansas (moments before a tornado warning) to transport a prisoner with no past and no identity. He is known simply as...SIN-JIN SMYTH!
