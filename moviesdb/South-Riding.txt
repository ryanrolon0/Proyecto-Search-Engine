He is trying to give his young daughter, Madge, and education, but is forced to send her to local public school where Sarah Barton has just been named Headmistress. Two schemers have a plan to do away with the slum section and build model homes on the site, this site being controlled by one of them, a sanctimonious hypocrite named Alfred Higgins. Their plan brings the gradual drawing closer together of Robert and Sarah who, at first, were antagonistic. She is instrumental in saving his estate and exposing the schemers at the local town-council meeting. The death of the invalid wife clears the way for a budding romance.
