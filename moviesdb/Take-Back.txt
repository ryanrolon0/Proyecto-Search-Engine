In a global effort, their first action is to build a new Superpower in Pyramid City. Following mid completion in 2052, Pyramid City is the largest man made structure on Earth and like most cities, it is also a place riddled with corruption and organized crime. However a team of two top level Bionic and Nano-Tech special forces soldiers become vigilantes in their old neighbourhood. Their actions kick start a retaliation from Mob Bosses and Gangs which soon escalate into a complex series of incidents and events! A frenzied action-packed chaos ensues, delivering explosive action sequences, spectacular fight scenes, strong drama, quick wit and gritty humour!
