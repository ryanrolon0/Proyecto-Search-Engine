The Battery Man

 One of the first things we learn as children is not to put our fingers in a power socket. What would your life look like if you found out electricity could not harm you? Biba Struja (Biba the Electricity) is capable of accumulating electricity and he can consciously control its power while discharging it. Thanks to the powers he discovered by accident as a teenager, this fifty-one-year-old man has spent his entire life experimenting with electricity and proving to himself and others that electricity can not harm him. He exposed his body to electric shocks of high voltage (up to 20 000V), entered the The Guinness Book of Records twice and he wasn't allowed to try the electric chair. Today, Electric Biba supports himself and his family by using his powers all over Serbia to cure people with electricity. The central story of the movie is Biba's attempt to discover what exactly happens in his body, but also to enter Guinness Book of Records for the third time. He will try to touch electricity voltage of one million volts and produce a laser beam. Is it possible and how does it work? Meet a man whose life was changed by electricity.
