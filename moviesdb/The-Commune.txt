The Commune

 A young virgin finds herself isolated in a remote commune of religious "family" members with a sinister agenda to ensure their supernatural survival. With the horror of entrapment, sacrifice and familial dysfunction as Jenny confronts the evil that is her father and his new family. When Jenny Cross (Chauntal Lewis) has to spend summer vacation with deadbeat dad (Stuart G. Bennett) on his creepy commune, she thinks clean living and boredom will kill her. But some fates are worse than death...Provocateur filmmaker Elisabeth Fies masterfully mixes psychological thriller, horror, satire, and coming of age movies to create a fresh, surprising mystery that winks at 1970s masterpieces.
