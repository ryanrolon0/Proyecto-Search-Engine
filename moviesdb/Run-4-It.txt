Run 4 It

 "RUN 4 IT a Hollywood blockbuster. Big budgets and high expectations have Tinsel Town's rumor mill buzzing. It's too bad the film's producers hired C-list actors and an experimental filmmaker to make it happen. "Run 4 It" has a chemistry as undeniable as Shatner doing Shakespeare. Train wreck? Hope so--and the cameras are there to catch it all. Overacting and under-directing make for a rousing gut-buster.
