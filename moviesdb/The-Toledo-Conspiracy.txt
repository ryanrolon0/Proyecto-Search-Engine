The Toledo Conspiracy

 Eddie Linda and Jimmy stumble into a back alley exchange and a world of problems. What they steal defies all logic, reasoning and leads them into a years old massacre, a government conspiracy, a made man, a glitzy preacher and a transvestite with a song. Eddie, Linda and Jimmy and use their spectacularly average intelligence and cavalier attitudes about life to untangle the web they have spun for themselves to its unavoidable end.
