Subdivide and Conquer

 This documentary takes a look at the problem of suburban sprawl in today's American West. Most of the growth in the West, as in the rest of America, is unplanned, on the fringes of cities, and centered around the automobile. Sprawl eats up open spaces, and fosters air pollution and traffic congestion. This film discusses the history and effects of sprawl, and offers some solutions.
