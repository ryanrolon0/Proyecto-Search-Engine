The Animated Star-Spangled Banner

 As a children's choir sings the first verse of "The Star-Spangled Banner", animated images, humorously related to the words in the song, flash by. Examples rain of hailstones accompanies the word "hailed"; and a Rockettes-style chorus line accompanies the word "rockets'".
