 Steve Allison warns freight-line owner Dan Parks not to transport U. S. gold, but when a hidden shipment is discovered on one his wagons, the suspicion lands on Parks, who resists arrest and flees. Allison, in his later-ego guise of the Durango Kid, sets out to clear his friend of the framed-up charge, by his crooked partner, Morgan, and also reunite him with his young son, Ronnie. When Dan Parks finds gold being smuggled on his freight line, his partner Morgan frames him as the smuggler. Fenton is the brains behind the smuggling operation and afraid his man Morgan will talk, breaks Parks out of jail and kills Morgan making it look like Parks did it. Steve Ellison who arrives investigating the smuggling operation knows his friend Parks is innocent and the Durango Kid soon goes into action.
