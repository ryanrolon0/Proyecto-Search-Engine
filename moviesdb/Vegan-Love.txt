Vegan Love

 Lovelorn Alex can't seem to live life on his own terms. After being dumped by a manipulative ex, Alex's filmmaker friend Kyle suggests making a documentary to find him a new girlfriend. Alex reluctantly agrees, but this time around Alex wants to find another vegan like him in the hopes of being with someone more "palatable". After each wrong turn, their simple mission quickly turns into a hilarious travesty that forces Alex to re-think his approach to life, love, and tofu.
