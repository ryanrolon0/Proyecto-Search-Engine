Un sorriso, uno schiaffo, un bacio in bocca

 Young rising star Renato Pozzetto (here seen in a weird "blonde" version) introduces an anthology of the best scenes in Italian cinema produced by Titanus Productions company between 1947 and 1962, the years of the first Golden Age in Italian movie history. We can see excerpts from classic movies such as "Il gattopardo" and "Sodoma e Gomorra". However, the anthology, narrated with great irony by the voice of Oreste Lionello, mainly focuses on musical numbers (featuring some of the most famous singers in the Sixties, such as Rita Pavone, Caterina Caselli, and Gianni Morandi), kiss sequences and "lovers fighting" sequences. Many of the comedy sequences star the greatest Italian comedian, Totò, as well as other big time comedians such as Alberto Sordi, Nino Manfredi and Vittorio Gassman.
