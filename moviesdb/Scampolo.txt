Scampolo

 Scampolo is a young orphan in Rome, Italy, who survives by doing all kinds of little jobs. Her only comforts in life are a little dog and an old professor, who both like to eat sugar. She's rejected by her drunken aunt because of the dog, and has to leave the house. Soon after, the dog dies. Scampolo then meets a young penniless engineering student, Sacchi, who's having an affair with an annoying "femme fatale". Scampolo becomes his maid, and the two gradually fall in love. One day, the government decides to fund a major engineering project designed by Sacchi, and he has to leave for Africa. Scampolo is desperate. At the station, while the train is already moving, Sacchi pulls her up, and takes her with him to Africa.
