Rearview Mirror

 When the psychopathic jailbreaker Hopps and his cousin steal a camper to continue their flight, they notice too late that there's a baby on the back seat. At first they want to kill it, but then decide to keep it as an easy hostage. Later they kidnap Terry Seton and force her to come with them too. Only detective Martiano is clever enough to track them down - but will he manage to get the hostages alive?
