Special Investigator

 Bill Fenwick, criminal lawyer, is becoming a mouthpiece for mobsters, when his brother George, a Justice Department investigator, is killed by mob chief Edward Selton. In atonement, Bill leaves his practice and his venal girlfriend and goes undercover in Nevada to investigate a scheme for "laundering" stolen gold bullion. He starts making progress when he pursues attractive Virginia, who's somehow involved with the gang; in fact, unknown to Bill, she's Selton's sister. When a jury frees racketeer Benny Gray, Judge Shaw rebukes the jury and then turns with contempt on Gray's defense attorney, William Fenwick, telling him he is just as much a public enemy as the criminals he defends. Later, Perkett, a department-of-justice agent, informs Fenwick that his brother George, a G-man, has been killed by Selton and his gang of racketeers to prevent George from recovering a half-million dollars in stolen gold bullion. Perkett tells Fenwick that Selton has been captured and tried twice, but that each time a slick attorney helped him beat the rap. The deeply-remorseful Fenwick decides to abandon his unethical practice and aid the justice department in tracking down the slayers of his brother.
