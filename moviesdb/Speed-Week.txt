Speed Week

 Nassau in the Bahamas hosts sports car racing. Cars arrive in December 1956 on a boat from Miami; they proceed in a parade to the course at the airport. Fans can study the races at Blackbeard's Tavern. On Friday, men race 70 miles for the Governor's Cup. The main rivalry is between Carroll Shelby and the Marquis de Portago, both in Ferraris. On Saturday, women race; thrills include a fire beneath the seat of one calm driver. The winner is a New York City sports reporter. On Sunday, the governor will present the cup to the winner of a 210-mile race Trophy Race. Sterling Moss, in a Maserati that was worked on up until the moment of the race, is the surprise winner.
