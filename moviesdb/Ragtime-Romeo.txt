Ragtime Romeo

 Flip the Frog is on the road in his tiny automobile. He's on his way to serenade his feline sweetie. On the way, a rich, cigar-chomping cat in his expensive car, honks at Flip, wanting to pass him. Flip's response is to press a lever on his car and extend its wheels in order to block every inch of the road. The cars themselves get in on the act the smaller one on his trunk. The smaller one gets even by lifting a wheel, like a dog lifting its leg, and spraying soot on the big car and its wealthy driver. Meanwhile, the girl-cat is admiring herself in the mirror as she gets ready for the night. As she removes her clothes, the picture of Flip on her dressing table gets embarrassed. But the animate portrait can't resist sneaking a peak. Finally, Flip himself arrives. He removes his tiny car like a tight piece of clothing and shakes it upside down. Out fall a dozen musical instruments, including a piano and a guitar. Flip serenades his sweetie to the delight of everyone in her apartment building - everyone, that is, except a homely cow, who at first thought the serenade was for her and is now trying to get to sleep.
