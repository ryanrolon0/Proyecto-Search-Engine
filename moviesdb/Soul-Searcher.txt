Soul Searcher

 Monroe makes his way to Brooklyn and meets Liv, a bartender/actress at the end of her rope. Liv seeks solace from her drunken boss in this mysterious stranger's gaze as they verbally dance through a first encounter. Scenes are juxtaposed with comic strips, creating a sense that a graphic novel has come to life. And the live action puts a metaphysical spin on what might happen if we hold onto our dreams for one more day.
