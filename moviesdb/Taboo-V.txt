His pool cleaner then successfully reveals to the cheated Naomi that he always had a crash on her. The piano player brings his friend over to Dr. Lodge's girlfriend. When Lodge finally dumps her, his also cheated daughter seduces him. After peeping on his mother's buxom figure, the son sneaks in her bedroom and surprises her in her sleep.
