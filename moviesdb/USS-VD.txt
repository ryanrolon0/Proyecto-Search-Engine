USS VD

 This film was made by the U.S. government during World War II to show its young servicemen the results of "fooling around" with "loose women" overseas. Actual victims of such sexually transmitted diseases as syphilis and gonorrhea are shown, along with the physical deterioration that accompanies those diseases.
