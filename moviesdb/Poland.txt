Poland

 'Poland' is a short that traces three women who just can't shake Poland from their thoughts. The first storyline follows the filmmaker and a trip she took to Poland in 2008 to find her grandmother's former home in Lublin. The second woman in the story is Marie Curie, international celebrity but Polish at heart. The third woman is the filmmaker's grandmother, who left Poland at the age of 10 with her family to join a failed homesteading project in rural 1930s Saskatchewan.
