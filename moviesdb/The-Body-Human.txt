The Body Human

 The program follows the progress in the relationships of two couples. One couple is seen from first meeting and strong attraction through courtship and marriage; the other, an older couple married many years, has seen a decrease in sexual activity and is followed undergoing clinical therapy to address the problem. There is also a study of sexual body language and the physical effects of attraction, and a look at the chronology of physical changes in sexual development from conception to adulthood.
