He agrees to help with thei car trouble, but some of the girls decide to look for a working phone inside the house even though Mr. Slausen warned them not too. Hidden within the home is Mr. Slausen's misunderstood mask hidden younger brother. What they learn is that the mannaquins seem very much alive, or is there something much more terrifying behind the mask?
