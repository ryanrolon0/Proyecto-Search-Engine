The Last Day of Coney Island

 "The amusement park at Coney Island was due to permanently close at nightfall on September 7 2008 due to conflicts between the lease holder of the park and developers keen to redevelop and beautify the boardwalk property with high rise condo apartment buildings and more modern entertainments. This short film features some of the people who came to reflect wistfully on "the poor man's Riviera" and others who cheered the change that would reinvigorate the boardwalk."
