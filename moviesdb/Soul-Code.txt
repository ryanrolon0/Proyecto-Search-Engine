Soul Code

 Set in a politically destabilized future, tech pioneer, Nora, has perfected a way to download and transfer a person's memory. "Soul Code" examines what happens when her memory is placed into a much younger woman's body. The film engages the larger themes of reckless ambition and the nature of the human soul.
