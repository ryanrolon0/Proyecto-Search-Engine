 Scruff Sheep is the odd one out in his flock. He's always late, always last, and always scruffy! Feeling rejected and unloved by the other sheep, Scruff wanders off to be on his own and passes the hen house at just the right time to help Little Hennie in her hour of need. So Scruff Sheep goes from 'zero to hero' in a charming story that proves that kindness will always be appreciated.
