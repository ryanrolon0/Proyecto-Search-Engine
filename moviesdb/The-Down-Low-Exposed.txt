The Down Low Exposed

 THE DOWN LOW EXPOSED Probes Secret World of Men Having Sex with Men While Masquerading as Heterosexuals in a Dangerous Gamble with Lives of Female Partners. This one-hour special traverses the backstreets, nightclubs, websites and even the sanctity of marriage where some Black men are leading 'double-lives' as heterosexuals with unsuspecting women; and then flipping the script in a dangerous duality of homosexual pursuits. The end result is confusion, anger, betrayal, tears, family destruction and, in some cases, the ultimate price of HIV and AIDS infections of the innocent and unknowing.
