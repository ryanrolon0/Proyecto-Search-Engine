The Gospel Truth

 When young journalism major Daisy Whitlock is assigned the task of producing a documentary about an influential member of her community, she makes the mistake of choosing former Broadway star and current mega-church Pastor Jefferson Rabinovitch as her subject the very day he walks out on his congregation. Rabinovitch believes it is his mission to make a movie based on an uncensored version of the Bible and partners up with Jay Jobson, a homeless guy he meets by divine decree; or so it seems. Claiming to be a filmmaker, Jay uses this opportunity to fulfill his lifelong dream of making an all-out adult film, all the while convincing Rabinovitch that he's staying true to the original Bible-based script. Auditions are held in Hollywood to find just the right actor to play Jesus; someone who's got that extra something special. A rock and roll legend agrees to sing the film's title song. Product placement opportunities are rolling in and the buzz for the film is growing. What could possibly go wrong? As the Bible implicitly states... dung happens. Initially offended by Jay's outlandish interpretations of the text, Rabinovitch discovers that those whose voices the church has tried to ignore, e.g. the gays and lesbians, the Universalists, the poor and oppressed, the sinners and the whores, all have something important to say to those who have ears to hear it. But Daisy's Pastor, an ambitious man with a heart set on preserving the status quo, wants to stifle those voices and leads an all out assault on Jay, Rabinovitch, and their film. Jay can't understand what the man's problem is... hasn't he read the Bible? It's chock full of adult material! Rabinovitch is too busy staying one step ahead of the Law to argue with Jay, especially since it looks like God's promises are not being fulfilled. Daisy, in spite of it all, just keeps her camera rolling as the 'Gospel Truth' becomes harder and harder.... to believe.
