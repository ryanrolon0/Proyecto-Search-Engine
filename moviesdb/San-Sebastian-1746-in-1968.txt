San Sebastian 1746 in 1968

 A look behind the scenes during the filming of "The Guns for San Sebastian," in Durango, Mexico. The off-screen narrator describes a multi-national and multi-lingual production, cast, and crew that uses authentic locales, props, and wardrobe to tell a story that's more than 200 years old. We see Anthony Quinn and others in character and out, on and off the set, as the narrator suggests that this sort of international collaboration is the future of filmmaking.
