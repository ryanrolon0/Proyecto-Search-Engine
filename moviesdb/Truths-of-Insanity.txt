Truths of Insanity

 Richard Michael Sannie awakens in a mental institution. Confused to his whereabouts and horrified at the accusations of murder, we follow Richard Sannie on his quest to discover the truth. Truths of Insanity unfolds through time cuts that move the viewer back and forth through an innovative non-linear style that keeps the reality of the story always just out of reach. How could Richard Sannie have killed his family, when his daughter is at the hospital eagerly awaiting a visit with him? Is the doctor a twisted psychiatrist who thrives on torturing innocent patients? How does the toothbrush-wielding homicidal maniac, fit into the picture? These are the questions the audience will ask to the very end.
