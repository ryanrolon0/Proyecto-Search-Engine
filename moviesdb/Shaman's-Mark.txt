Shaman's Mark

 Shaman's Mark is a supernatural thriller about a university psychology professor who finally gets funding for a paranormal research lab. The catch is that he must do his first investigations at the historic Poverty Point archeology dig site - the site where his archeologist wife committed suicide six months earlier. Now, only the professor's worst nightmares can possibly save him from death.
