The Guest Worker

 On a hot, soggy day on a farm in North Carolina, 12 men sit on a porch watching the rain wash away another day's work, another day's wages. One of those men, 66 year-old Candelario, has been coming to the United States for 40 years, harvesting our crops and trying to provide for his family. Without benefits, without retirement, he battles against the elements, his own age, and the backbreaking work, returning to this farm year after year as, The Guestworker.
