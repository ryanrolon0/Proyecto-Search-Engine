The Role of the Observer

 A young novelist living with his artist wife in a San Francisco apartment regularly disappears into the eclectic and sometime alarming events described in his book.It becomes unclear whether the events in the book are truly fiction, or the writer's memories, or cultural memories he is somehow tapping. Adding to the fragmented, nearly surreal atmosphere are visits by the ghost of the writer's deceased uncle, who is more annoying than helpful.
