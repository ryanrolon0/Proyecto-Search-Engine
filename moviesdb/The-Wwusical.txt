The Wwusical

 The talented and athletic Trey is accepted to Western Washington University's football team. However since we really don't care, the story follows his emo girlfriend Kira who deals with the loss of her close friend while Trey manipulates her emotions and uses her unscrupulously for his musical theatre exploits. Literally friends with Death, Kira contemplates suicide while the ruthless theatre sibling-duo Sharpie and Ron try to murder her. Warm and optimistic, The WWUsical is a delightfully light piece of musical entertainment for the whole family. Parodies High School Musical and Twilight.
