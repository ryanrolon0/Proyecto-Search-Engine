The Last Breadbox

 Introducing "The Last Breadbox", a new kind of China documentary guerrilla, and scored with the latest in underground Beijing rock. This is a no-seatbelts look at a city in metamorphosis, told through the eyes of three Beijing cabbies awaiting the decision for the 2008 Olympic host city. One is retrenched and looking for work, one is a woman struggling in a male-dominated industry, and another is obsessed with building the perfect fish tank. Culminating in the heart of the Tiananmen Square celebrations, with a city wide frenzy unseen since 1989, "The Last Breadbox" offers the inside story of three Beijingers expressing what it is to be Chinese, to be taxi drivers, and why the Beijing Olympics will change the face of China.
