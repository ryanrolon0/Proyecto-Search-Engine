Wall Scaling

 "This excellent picture shows the work of the Royal English Engineers. By the courtesy of the Commanding Officers we are enabled to procure a most interesting picture, giving an example of the method of attack on a fort where a wall must be climbed. Several hundred men are taking part in the attack. The scaling ladders are brought up by a number of soldiers whose advance is covered by a firing party sent for the purpose of keeping down the hail of bullets which is sent from the fort."
