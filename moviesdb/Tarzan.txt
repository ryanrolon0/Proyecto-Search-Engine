Tarzan

 The time All-Story weekly, complete in one issue, a new hero for all - the jungle lord Tarzan made his debut. This was only the second published story by 'Edgar Rice Burroughs' (qv), but was the beginning of an empire - of books, of things, and of the movies. This documentary looks at the creator through the eyes of friends and family, and follows his most famous creation from pulp fiction to comics to America's heart on the silver screen. From the silent era with 'Elmo Lincoln' (qv) in _Tarzan of the Apes (1918)_ (qv) to a Hayes office scandalized by the minimalist costume of 'Maureen O'Sullivan' (qv) in _Tarzan and His Mate (1934)_ (qv) to 'Bo Derek' (qv) as Jane in an R-rated jungle epic, Tarzan is a part of film heritage. And he continues today on television, with 'Joe Lara' (qv) as the hero and morphing monsters in a digitally-augmented setting.
