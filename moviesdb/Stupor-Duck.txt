Stupor Duck

 Daffy Duck is a mild-mannered reporter with a secret identity in this parody of the "Superman" serials. Daffy, however, is his usual inept, overweening self, ramming into buildings and rescuing submarines and trains from a non-existant menace, a villain whose voice he heard on his editor's television program. One of a series of "Superman" spoofs, produced as an animated short by Warner Bros. Daffy Duck is cast as Cluck Trent, a "mild mannered reporter" at a major daily metropolitan newspaper. Cluck eavesdrops on his editor, who is watching a crime drama about "Aardvark Ratnik," a fictional villain hell-bent on world domination. Cluck, believing Aardvark is an actual villian who has announced his plans the editor, changes into Stupor Duck and searches for the non-existant villian. One by one, he spots "examples" of "Aardvark's" supposed work among them, a skyscraper being razed to make way for a new city hall; a train wreck that's actually a stunt for a new Warner's movie; a sinking ship that turns out to be a submarine; and a nuclear missile that's actually a rocket headed for the moon (with Cluck/Daffy holding on for dear life).
