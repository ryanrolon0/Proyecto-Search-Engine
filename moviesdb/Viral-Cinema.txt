Viral Cinema

 Viral Cinema is designed to fit the future syntax of the Visual Medium as determined by the hyper-proliferation of viral and handheld technologies as well as the current and future trends in editing and narrative filmmaking. Each individual film, culled from images of both the political and banal, stands alone as a seconds-long narrative statement but can also be displayed simultaneously or in sequence along with the other films as a collective. The goal is to at once subvert the audience's consumption of popular image and strip common footage of its everyday redundancies, undressing mainstream visual media and laying bare it's horrifying implications. Viral Cinema projects a future medium at it's most extreme where ideas, narratives and images are consumed, spread, and discarded in moments.
