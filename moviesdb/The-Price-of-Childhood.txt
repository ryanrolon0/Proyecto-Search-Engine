The Price of Childhood

 The story of working children in Nepal is a complicated one. It is a story of traditional worlds destroyed by modern forces, of ethnic oppression, of political upheaval, of simple cruelty and remarkable hope. The Price of Childhood seeks to explain this phenomenon through the narratives of those who live with child labor government, scholars, and normal folks we meet along the way. In better understanding the situation from these various perspectives, the film aims to assist in improving the lives of those who suffer.
