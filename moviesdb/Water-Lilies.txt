Water Lilies

 "Water Lilies" is the story of Richard, a psychiatrist, and the intertwined lives of his three patients. Katherine, a schoolteacher, complains of the affairs she's having. John, a surgeon, worries that his wife is having affairs. Jennifer, a college student, admits to having an affair with a married man, who happens to be a surgeon. In the therapy sessions, Richard confides to each that he plans to quit his practice. Even with the dissolution of their relationships, the patients must give Richard a compelling reason to stay.
