Thief of Damascus

 In the world of Arabian Nights, Abu Amdar, head general of the Khalid, who is attacking Damascus, arranges a truce between the city and the Khalid's forces, and the Khalid is furious. Amdar escapes to help the Persians, a decision prompted by his love for the Damascan Princes Zafir. With the aid of Sheherazade, Alladin, Sinbad, Ali Baba and less-than-forty of his thieves, Abu Amdar soon sets things right in old Damascus...and Columbia's back lot.
