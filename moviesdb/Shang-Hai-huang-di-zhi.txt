 The continuing saga of the life of one of the most powerful men in China in the first half of the 20th Century.

Pondering his future, he decides to make a strong commitment to the country, opting for high society over getting high. But the 1937 attack by the Japanese on Shanghai throws both Luk and his country into turmoil. Luk is forced to flee to Hong Kong.
