Room

 In contemporary Houston, Julia Barker and her husband live paycheck to paycheck; she delivers meals on wheels and works Bingo nights. She's stressed. She's gotten over-weight and doesn't recognize the puffy and tired face she sees in the mirror. She's having migraines and blackouts, and she's seeing visions - of a desolate room. Suddenly she leaves for New York City, checks into a cheap hotel, and goes in search of the room. She follows any sign she can find meditation group, a Tarot reading, and an invitation to a party. Is she getting closer? But to what?
