Wasabi Tuna

 It's the night before Halloween and everyone in LA is trying to make time to finish their costumes for the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Fredrico, Dave, Evan, Harvey and Emme have all been waiting for this day to come for what seems like an eternity. Emme has the perfect solution, something edgy, something fresh, something dangerous, something which will defy all expectations, to dress up as gang bangers. But in order to achieve that authentic straight from the hood look, they have to go to the professionals. The five friends split up and Dave makes his way to East LA where he meets Romeo, a real life gangster who agrees to loan Dave his purple low rider in exchange for Dave's cherry red Porsche.
