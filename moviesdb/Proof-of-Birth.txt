Proof of Birth

 All what Luis Gonzalez wants is to send money to his family back home. But life is not simple in the United States. Whenever he thinks he knows what to do, Luis is proved wrong. In order to obtain a legal ID, he must travel through the illegal immigrants' underworld, along the way meeting Greek diner owners, Asian moneylenders, Dominican busboys, Polish au pairs and Russians phone-sex workers. The tests that Luis faces on his road trip are extreme and varied, forcing the formerly invisible immigrant to stand up and declare his identity.
