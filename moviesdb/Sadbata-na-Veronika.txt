Sadbata na Veronika

 This film is about the children from a home for "Children deprived of parental care" in Ugarchin, Bulgaria. Soap operas are a dream and fantasy world. A group of volunteers helps the kids to create their own world - they teach them how to write screenplays, build screen decor and act own soap opera. END
