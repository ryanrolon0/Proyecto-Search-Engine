The Terrornauts

 Residents of a radio telescope laboratory are kidknapped when they answer a mysterious signal from outer space. They are taken to a satelite inhabited only by robots, where they are presented with a series of intelligence tests. Since this is a mystery as well as a sci-fi movie I will only say that the rest of the plot deals with theyre attempt to find out why they've been kidknapped, and how they will get back to earth.
