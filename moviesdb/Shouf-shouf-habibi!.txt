Shouf shouf habibi!

 Abdullah 'Ap' Bentarek may be happy that, unlike his Uncle Yusuf who stayed in the ancestral Moroccan mountain village, his own father, Ali, moved to the Netherlands. However, the boy has lousy friends, who are his partners in crime (in the legal sense), and unrealistic expectations at the employment office. Even when a relative gets him the office job he claimed to crave in the very bank his mates dream of robbing, he messes it up in a single day and rejoins the louts. Meanwhile his sister Leila refuses to be married off, and kid brother Driss abuses father's ignorance of the Dutch language to pretend the school's complaints about him are compliments.
