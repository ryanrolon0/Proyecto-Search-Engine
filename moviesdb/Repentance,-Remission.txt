Repentance, Remission

 This 11-minute short film captures alpinist Steve House free-soloing two of New England's hardest ice climbs back-to-back. House solos Repentance and Remission on Cathedral Ledge in New Hampshire, 500-foot ice climbs that are heralded as the most classic winter routes in the East. House gets more than he bargained for on the notorious chock stone of Repentance, scratching his way insecurely up the dry, overhanging granite with heart-pounding effort.
