This Is Colour

 A short documentary to demonstrate what can be done with Technicolor film and to show various other colourful products. Aimed at advertisers, there are a lot of shots of paint being spilled from cans and mixing to show a range of colours. It was part sponsored by I.C.I. (Imperial Chemical Industries) who, among other things, made paint as well as the dyes and coloured plastics that are also seen. An early demonstration of the skills of cinematographer 'Jack Cardiff' (qv).
