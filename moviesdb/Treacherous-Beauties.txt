Treacherous Beauties

 A female photographer hears that her brother has been shot dead at a horse rearing farm. She decides to go there herself and uncovers a murky conspiracy. On Canadian mountain town Devil's Gorge's prestigious stud farm, head coach Alan Kerr dies in a gun accident, or that's the official story. Tipped off, his sister Anne Marie, a career journalist, uses the alias Mackenzie to spy on the owners, brothers Jason Hollister, a domineering womanizer, and Brent, who is pushed by his greedy wife Simone, as photographer for their thoroughbreds auction. She shares with the local ranger-forester-cop Matt Garven theories about professional or amorous revenge, blackmail and/or fraud.
