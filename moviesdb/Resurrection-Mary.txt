Resurrection Mary

 On a dark and creepy road, teenager Jeff Pryce nearly runs down a beautiful, yet mysterious young girl walking alone by Resurrection Cemetery.

But Jeff's life begins to spin out of control shortly after he asks "Mary" to be his date at Homecoming -- as one by one, his friends are brutally murdered. Having spent time in juvenile hall, Jeff becomes the prime suspect. Who is Mary? Why is everyone around him dying? And will Jeff's desperate measures to clear his name put him face-to-face with the real killer?
