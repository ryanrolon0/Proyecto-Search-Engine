The Final Sanction

 Tensions between the USA and Russia erupt into full scale war, leading to a limited exchange of nuclear weapons. Forced by the U.N. to the negotiating table, diplomats between the two superpowers decide on an unusual way to end the conflict them both in a 20-acre arena in a one-on-one fight to the death. Winner take all. On the American side, Tom Batanic, a hot-tempered U.S. Army sergeant imprisoned in the notorious Levenworth military prison for murder charges is unwilling recruited for training under the direction of his female handler Tavin. On the Russian side, Sergei Schvackov is a sergeant in the USSR Special Forces recruited for the training under the watchful eye of his handler and mentor Major Galashkin. Overseen by the diplomats, Tom and Sergei, are fully armed and sent into the forested arena where the two hot-headed soldiers attempt to outmaneuver each other until Tavin begins to see the real reason behind the event and why her superiors want NEITHER soldier to win this conflict.
