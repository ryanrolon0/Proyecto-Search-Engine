Rope

 A methodic young man is felling like his life has been snatched from him and plots a scheme to commit suicide. In a confused state of mind, he drives his car to a park wearing a suit and having a rope in his hands. He parks his car, and while preparing the gallows in a tree and checking his watch, he repeats many time the sequence of words "- rope, suit, park, hang" in his thoughts as if it was a check list for committing suicide.
