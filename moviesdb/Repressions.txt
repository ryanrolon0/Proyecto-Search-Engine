Repressions

 Janie is a jobless, 31-year-old woman in a troubled relationship. Unhappy with her life, she seeks help from psychologist Dr. Flowers. Over a series of therapy sessions, Flowers convinces Janie that her life is not what it seems and that she is repressing a terrible secret from her childhood, which is the root of her current problems. Soon horrifying memories of sexual abuse begin coming back to Janie. But are Janie's memories real...or a product of her therapist's suggestions?
