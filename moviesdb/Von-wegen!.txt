Von wegen!

 Fabian and Jana just wanted to hitch a ride to Italy, but this little arrogant prick in his Jeep really didn't deserve any better. First he almost runs them over, then he tries to blame them. Big mistake. So they do what (almost) everbody would have done Although a couple of miles later they make an unpleasant discovery arrogant prick's girlfriend is sleeping off her marijuana flush in the back seat. And she's holding her boyfriend's gun. No problem for Fabian, who's always game for a loony scenario. He starts telling the girl a really tall tale, trying to convince her not to return - but instead to keep on driving to Italy. He succeeds, of course, but keeps on telling his tale. Slowly but steady Fabian loses track of his own story, mixing things with his own past - thus swiftly skipping genres from horror to romance and all there is in between. Eventually Jana hits the breaks. Fed up with Fabian's constant tale-spinning she only wants to hear one thing stories, no more charming lies, no more covering mistakes from the past.
