Vive les vacances

 Roger and Jeannot, two jolly good fellows, are workers in a car factory. When the summer holidays come they merrily mount their scooter and head for the French Riviera where they intend to live cheerful holidays. They finally reach their destination after going through a host of colorful misadventures on the road and are soon caught into an imbroglio. Indeed, after boarding a yacht following two sailors, the boat sails away and they are unable to disembark, at least for a while. This is only a minor problem since they are immediately hired as mechanics and cooks, to everyone's satisfaction. To crown it all, there is Graziella, the niece of the king of naphtha, whose endearing charms do not leave Roger insensitive. And the belle has a lady friend by the name of Ingrid, who happens to be as rich as she is, and who kindles Jeannot's flame. But things are not as simple as they appear...
