 Mohammed is a retired factory-worker. He lives alone in the Sonacotra residence for workers. But he is now ill and is being forced to leave the room he has occupied for so many years. Deciding to leave with his dignity, he chooses to return to his homeland, Tunisia, a country he has not seen for years.
