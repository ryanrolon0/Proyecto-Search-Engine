The Frome

 A short film following the course of the River Frome from where it rises at the foot of the Cotswolds to its mouth in Bristol city centre. It was made as part of a competition called 'Bristol's Best Kept Secret' at the Wildscreen Film Festival 2008. We had 24 hours to shoot it (in terrible weather!) and 4 hours to edit.
