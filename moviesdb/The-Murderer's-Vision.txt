The Murderer's Vision

 Scene opens with murderer in cell, his head resting in his hands upon the table. As he looks up, upon the wall is enacted the story of the crime, which disappears and is succeeded by the head of the victim, which addresses him, and finally dissolves out of view, the murderer falling down upon the floor of the cell. Both visions are shown in movement.
