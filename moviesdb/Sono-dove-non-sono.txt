Sono dove non sono

 Pino Ballerini is a 99 years old artist, poet, musician and - since the age of 86 - singer of a rock band. He started to create his art as a prisoner during the war and, in spite of the appreciation he had then received in his life, never wanted to sell his artworks, but put them on the streets of his hometown, gave them to family and friends or installed them in the natural environments which he so much loves. His work is inspired from nature and communicates the delight and love of life in its most spiritual and magical sense.
