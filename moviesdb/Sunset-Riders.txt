Sunset Riders

 It's 1916, and the Wild West is getting fenced in for good. Out of work cowboys Travis Tyree and Sandy head west to Los Angeles, where two men who are good with horses can get semi-steady work as extras in western motion pictures. Their paths diverge, for Travis becomes a star and Sandy just plugs along as an extra, and their former friendship comes to a point of confrontation the old-fashioned way -- over a woman.
