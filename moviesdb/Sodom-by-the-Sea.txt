Sodom by the Sea

 "Sodom by the Sea" is the story of Billy Giuscardo, 60's, a Coney Island old timer, thinking about selling his historic carousel ride as redevelopment hits the world famous amusement area. He's down on his luck until meeting two young, flirtatious girls who suddenly befriend him. Do these two sexy sirens have ulterior motives? "Sodom by the Sea" is the story of Billy Giuscardo, Coney Island, and a pair of dangerous sirens. Billy, 63, has been riding the famous B&B Carousel (the very last of what was once 25 wooden carousels) since the 1950's, when the Dodgers where still in Brooklyn. He's owned it since the 1970's, when Coney Island was still home to three separate wooden roller coasters. He has stayed true to Coney long after most others abandoned it. This summer, after all the many down years, Billy, now faces his biggest challenge of them all, sirens!
