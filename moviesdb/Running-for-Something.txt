Running for Something

 The teens in a small town in Indiana have a problem, they have nowhere to skateboard or ride BMX. In an attempt to get by many have been arrested while riding in locations around the city. Running For Something focuses on a man who decides to bring attention to the situation, and just maybe raise enough money to build a skate/bmx park for the city. His mission miles over the course of 3 days, the only problem is, he's never done it before.
