Triple Word

 It's the near future and mass panic over terrorism has created a cold war environment. People are ready to evacuate to Mars should missiles be launched and the Earth be destroyed. Seeing the signal to leave, students Ryan, Toke and Billy launch their escape pod, leaving Earth far behind. Travelling through space it's clear entertainment has been somewhat overlooked in the evacuation plan. One room, three friends a guitar and a Scrabble board. A two year journey suddenly feels like a horribly long time.
