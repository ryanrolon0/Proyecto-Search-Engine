The Whip

 Lord Brancaster, a decent and upright British nobleman, loses his memory in an accident. While in this amnesiac condition, he becomes involved with the training of a horse, the Whip, for racing at Ascot. Attempts to prevent the Whip running, as well as attempts to cheat Brancaster out of his rightful estate, almost succeed.
