Trouble in Tahiti

 Tom Cairns cinematic film presents Bernstein's short opera set in 1950's America. The opera is a satire on American suburban married life with Dinah and Sam facing marital breakdown, from which the lastest movie release "Trouble in Tahiti" is the only escape. The score is a pathbreaking fusion of lyric art with popular entertainment.
