Prairie Landscapes

 The landscape of the prairies changes dramatically as professional hockey expands and draws more and more talented young men away from their declining family farms, conservative lifestyles and relative poverty into a life of professional sport, big dollars and fast living. The dreams and nightmares of the young men, their girlfriends, buddies and family members, mix and match in a new prairie landscape, a collage of joy, disappointment and tragedy.
