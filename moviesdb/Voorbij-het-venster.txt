Voorbij het venster

 'Voorbij het Venster' is a poetic translation of the Peter Pan myth to the imaginary world of a young boy confined to his wheelchair. With the starry sky as his only glimpse to the outside world, the boy spends all his hours on staring out of the window in search of a falling star to make his long cherished wish come true But when the heavens answer in the shape of a mysterious jester his unreal wish may have some very real consequences.
