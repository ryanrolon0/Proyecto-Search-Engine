The Black Box

 Audrey lives in an era simply referred to as 'The Shut-In Period.' Basically meaning that after nightfall one best keep their ass shut behind closed doors. The world has ended and no one is exactly sure why. Most have either died or gone mad. The few who remain fight and kill for survival in a world dominated by the Internet. In a move to stem rising violence, everyone has been implanted with a chip that records every second of every day. The device referred to as 'The Black Box' does its job well. Too well. Memories, thoughts, and emotions live on...even after death.
