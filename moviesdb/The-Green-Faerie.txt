The Green Faerie

 Mr. Harold, a wealthy gentleman of leisure, intends to spend another lazy day submerged in literature, but with the aid of a mysterious jade liquor, his serving maid, Gwenyth, brings from fantasy to reality his cherished tales of adventure and romance. Ensorcelled by his beautiful companion, Mr. Harold is more than willing to be both fool and servant to the woman who once served him.
