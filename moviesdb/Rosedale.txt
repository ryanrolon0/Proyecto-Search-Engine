Rosedale

 An evil cult is determined to summon a powerful spirit through a sacrificial ritual. The spirit has chosen one man to be the sacrifice and will not accept a substitute. Success for the cult seems definite until a supernatural expert and adventurer named Victor Whiskey decides to stand in their way and prevent the sacrifice. Ever determined, the cult will stop at nothing to crush the opposition and carry out their dark task. Now, Victor must use all his cunning and bravado to blast his way through the cult in a kill or be killed showdown of good against evil.
