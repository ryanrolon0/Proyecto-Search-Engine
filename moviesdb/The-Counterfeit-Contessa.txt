The Counterfeit Contessa

 Gina Nardino, a young saleswoman at the food counter of a posh department store, falls hard for a society stud, and, through a series of accidents, impresses him by taking on the false identity of an Italian contessa. But the masquerade begins to get out of hand when the stud's brother sees through her disguise...and likes what he sees.
