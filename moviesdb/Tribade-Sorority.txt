Tribade Sorority

 Sunny is campaigning to become President of Tribade Sorority and soliciting votes from Penny and alumni Michelle. Meanwhile back at the house, Sinn is being a bitch bossing the girls around and pissing them off by not following the rules, especially Kristina. Charlie has had just enough of Sinn's bullshit, good thing Daisy is there to soothe her.
