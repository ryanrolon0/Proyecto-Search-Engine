Underwater

 The most treasured and storied ballet has been transformed, and captured in sterling cinematic magic by Key West filmmaker Karen Leonard and edited by Quincy Perkins. "UNDERWATER" follows the making of NUTCRACKER KEY WEST, chronicling the marvels of this magical ballet presented to Key West by Paradise Ballet Theatre in December 2005, under the most remarkable conditions and challenges in the aftermath of the worst Florida Keys hurricane season in living memory. This unprecedented production of NUTCRACKER KEY WEST is the creation of dancer and choreographer Joyce Stahl, who reinterpreted the fabled ballet with original Key West tropical imagery and icons. The spectacle is accented by the perseverance of Stahl as the film reveals the passion needed to realize the dream of giving to the community a treasured ballet that Key West could establish as an annual tradition.
