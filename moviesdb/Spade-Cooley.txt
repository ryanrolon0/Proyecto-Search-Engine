Spade Cooley

 Fiddle player 'Spade Cooley' (qv) and his band play western swing music. His band came into prominence when during the local elections for sheriff, both campaigns asked him to play for them. He decided to be bi-partisan and play for both. The band then played at the local rodeo, and then moved onto to several other venues, such as at a dude ranch. Even at non traditional western swing events such as at a square dance, Cooley's band added its own special brand of music. These events led to a national radio broadcast and more widespread fame.
