The Horse on the Merry-Go-Round

 Weary of his running-in-circles existence as a merry-go-round horse, the little hobby-horse gets a case of wanderlust. That night he gets out after the fair has closed and takes in the world of the Crazy House, the Wax Museum, the Ferris Wheel and a roller coaster. Battered and beaten from his adventures, he concludes he is better off on his stand at the merry-go-round.
