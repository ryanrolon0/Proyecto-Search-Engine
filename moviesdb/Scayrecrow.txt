Scayrecrow

 1742 - and the daring robberies of Joshua Rookwood are the talk of all of England. No-one it seems is safe on the Kings highways from the notorious highwayman and his fearful alter-ego 'The Scayrecrow'. Though his name is whispered in the same breath as Turpin, Rookwood's motives are not mere brutality and greed. Every full moon, after robbing the gentry of their riches, Rookwood steals away to deliver the choicest of the booty to his love, the serving girl Eleanor Tawney. As the reward for his capture grows ever large, these moonlit rendezvous attract unwanted attention...and slowly and surely plans are drawn against them.
