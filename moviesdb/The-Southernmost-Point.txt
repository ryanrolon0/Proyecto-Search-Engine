The Southernmost Point

 After the death of his parents in a car accident, Charlie Walden (Kevin Bein) finds himself in Florida, living with his grandmother (Susan Jones Mannino), who isn't quite sure she's prepared to raise another child. As he comes to terms with the sudden changes in his life --new friends, a new school, and a new home --Charlie confronts the truth behind his parents' death and the distant, happier memories he has of being a child.
