Soul Mates

 A narrative film about two young girls, Elena and Anna, whose friendship stands the test of time in the midst of war, hate, cultural and religious differences. It is set during World War II in the Macedonia's capital Skopje, when Yugoslavia falls under the Fascist regime, and Eastern Macedonia is occupied by the Bulgarian Nazis. "Soul Mates" is a reminder of the Sephardic Jewish influence on European history, as characters confront power relationships and come to the terms with the meaning of justice.
