The Maori Merchant of Venice

 The Maori take on Shakespeare's 'pound of flesh' drama is a story of deep seated social and religious prejudice, that has its revenge in a money lending deal that is bonded in a pound of the Christian merchant's flesh on forfeit. The Jew (Shylock) has a long memory of oppression, but revenge is not so sweet.
