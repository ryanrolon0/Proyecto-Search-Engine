The Axe Man

 Who do you call when your company has to fire people? A lot of people? A lot of pissed off people? You call Derek Dean, the best 'Axe Man' in the business. Three people lay dead after a disgruntled employee opens fire. With dozens of layoffs still to go, a friend offers Derek more money than he can refuse for one more assignment. As corporate lies and clashes with existing management mount, Derek struggles to finish the assignment. But, as mysterious events unfold, he finds himself traveling down the same road which led to the initial shooting.
