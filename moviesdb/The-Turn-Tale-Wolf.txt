The Turn-Tale Wolf

 The Big Bad Wolf's proper little nephew has learned at school that his uncle was the fiend who blew the Three Little Pigs' houses down and is ashamed that his uncle, flesh of his flesh and blood of his blood, could have committed such a deed. When confronted by his nephew with this information, Big Bad pleads innocent. He tells a quite different story of how he was an innocent, nature-loving kid tormented by Three sadistic Little Pigs, who, upon reading of a 50 dollar bounty for a wolf's tail, chased him home and blew his house down!
