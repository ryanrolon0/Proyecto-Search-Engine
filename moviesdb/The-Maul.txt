The Maul

 THE MAUL is a modern day contemporary action drama that is an extremely provocative, hard-hitting, hard-edge action-thriller, and a powerful tale of faith and loyalty, inequity, violence and betrayal. 'Brad Taylor', the main character is basically a peaceful social worker who finds himself in a curious violent 'back-world' where brutality, murder, drugs, and perversion run rampant. Soon Brad will have to make a choice to act when he finds out his wife has been raped and brutalized by the 'very people' he was trying to save. Reg WGA
