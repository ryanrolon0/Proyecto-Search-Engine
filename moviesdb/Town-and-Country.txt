Town and Country

 Amidst a shrinking agricultural backdrop, TOWN AND COUNTRY follows two farm families as their children prepare to show livestock at the annual county fair. While their parents see farm life dying, the children's enthusiasm and determination offer hope for a different path to the future of the American farmer. No one sees the difficulty of the American family farm more clearly than the children raised there, those who hope to become farmers themselves. They face a future of skyrocketing land prices and production costs magnified by diminishing returns on livestock and grain. TOWN AND COUNTRY follows the Aholt and the Meyer children as they prepare to show their animals at the annual county fair. But the urbanization of their county fair is reflected in the changes of their once-small town, now engulfed by big box stores and "McMansion" sprawl, sitting on what was once fertile farmland. The children struggle to balance encroaching modern life and urban sprawl with the world they know - working the land, raising livestock, and enjoying the peace and solitude that they find in farm life. While their parents see farming as a dying way of life, the children's enthusiasm and determination offer hope for a different path to the future of the American farmer.
