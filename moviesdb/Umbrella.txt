Umbrella

 Mia's best friend Rachel has just left. She remembers all the good times they've had together, such as when they first met and the time they first met Kelsey. Kelsey has always been the third wheel in the group. Mia's memories end, and she walks into the library, accidentally walking in on Kelsey. The two argue, and Mia says that they were never friends. Kelsey leaves Mia. Can Mia sum up to courage to apologize, can their friendship be restored?
