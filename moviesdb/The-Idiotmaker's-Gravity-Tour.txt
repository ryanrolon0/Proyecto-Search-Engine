The Idiotmaker's Gravity Tour

 Max Plugin is a jaded relic of the 60's who has recently turned 54 years old. Currently in a state of high malaise, Max ran away from home at age 16 to hitchhike across country from Hibbing, Minnesota. A guru-like figure named Teschlock took Max under his wing when Max reached the Lost Coast area of California. Teschlock invited Max to come to India with him and a few other 'disciples' to live on an ashram. Max, following a truly transcendent meditation experience, declined and returned home to the bosom of his family to lead a different life, thinking he had been taken as far as he could be. Now, decades later, full of vague regret, Max finds himself in Uttar Pradesh in search of his guru's unknown grave-site. A year after arriving there, Master Teschlock went off and vanished one day in remote rural India, never to be heard from again. It is said that Teschlock buried himself, much akin to the Biblical fate of Moses. Max has now come to India for the first time to find the gravesite, following a trail of cryptic clues.
