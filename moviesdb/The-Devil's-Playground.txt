The Devil's Playground

 Hoppy finds a wounded girl and later finds Judge Morton who claims the girl is his daughter and he is looking for her. But Hoppy soon learns the girl is looking for stolen gold she wants to return and the Judge in not her father but only wants the gold. Hoppy and the girl find the gold but the Judge and his men find Hoppy and the boys and trap them in a cabin. In the 55th film of the series, "Hopalong" Cassidy and his two sidekicks, "Lucky" Jenkins and "California" Carlson, are trailing a stray dogie (calf)when darkness forces them back toward their ranch. Halting at a line-shack they find the doorknob smeared with blood, and the trail leading through their cabin. They find an unconscious girl bleeding from a bullet wound in her arm. Before long, "Hoppy" and his pals find themselves up against a dwarf, plus a renegade judge who claims to be searching for his demented daughter (but isn't), and instead tries to kill her, while relieving her of a map to a hidden cache of gold.
