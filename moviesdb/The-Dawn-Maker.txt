The Dawn Maker

 Joe Elk, half-Indian, half-white, attempts to secure for his tribe the benefits of schools and medicine such as he had seen on a trip to Montreal, far to the south. Joe loves Alice McRae, daughter of the local trading-post factor. But both Alice and the tribe reject Joe's entreaties. A blizzard threatens to destroy them all.
