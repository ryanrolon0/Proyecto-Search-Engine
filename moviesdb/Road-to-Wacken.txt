Road to Wacken

 The plot is focus on Princess of the Night, a Spanish heavy metal band, entirely formed by girls , all of them from a small city, without more hopes or dreams than the music they use to play in nasty bars. Even though, they win the Metal Battle, the Wacken Open Air contest they organize every year in 26 countries to give new and emerging bands the opportunity to play at the biggest heavy music festival of the world. So the story begins at the last Princess of the Night gig in their city before start their travel to Wacken, and at least try to achieve their dream. The band members, young, pretty and cheeky, with their clumsy manager, lead us across this road movie where we can enjoy the Wacken Open Air 2010 bands live shows, with mythical names as Alice Cooper, Soulfly, Edguy, Grave Digger, Stratovarius, etc and collaboration of Blind Guardian, Helloween or Doro.
