Pollen Nation

 Pollen Nation follows one migratory beekeeper and a semi-load full of honeybees from Minnesota to California, investigating why bees are dying in record numbers. It's a science documentary disguised as an American road movie, and the first film to explore what happens when pollination - nature's ancient and ingenious intersection of plants and insects - becomes a global commodity.
