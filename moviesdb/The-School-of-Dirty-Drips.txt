The School of Dirty Drips

 "The School of Dirty Drips" is based on the highly successful version produced in the early 1990's. The new version is hosted by Vanelle and contains footage from the studio as well as the field, enhanced with computer animations to cover the information with more detail. At it's core, "The School of Dirty Drips" was developed by Dave Jones, an industry professional who owns and operates three quick-lube facilities. There are two bonus videos on the DVD Really Saying". Both of these will enable you to be the best bottom tech you can be.
