The New Job

 Today is Frank's first day on the new job. He's prepared. He's looking forward to it. This IS the first day of the rest of his life! But what happens when he realizes that he's slept in? And even worse, that his mouth smells like kitty litter and he's woken up in a wrinkled pink dress! "The New Job" is a light-hearted comedy about impressions.
