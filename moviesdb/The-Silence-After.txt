The Silence After

 Margaret thinks she has the perfect life a loving faithful husband. She sets out on a road trip with her four year old daughter, Meghan and they drive on the winding back roads of the California countryside. They stop occasionally for gas and snacks or to stop in a motel for the night. But all is not what it seems. The peacefulness of this idyllic setting clashes with the noise going on in Margaret's mind. Margaret has a big decision to make. She has witnessed something she cannot understand or define, and she is not sure what to do about it. She is plagued by memories of her life, as what she thought she knew clashes with what she thinks she saw. One false move could threaten the quality of her daughter's life forever, and she must decide before this road trip is through.
