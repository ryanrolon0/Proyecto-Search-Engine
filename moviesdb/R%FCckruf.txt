Rückruf

 With the traveling-diary of his great-grandmother and with a lot of questions Jakob returns from Israel. The first thing on his list is to call is grandmother Eva. 'Spots of light are dissolving slowly out of the flickering black, developing blurred reflexions and in the end faces, buildings, people, cities and landscapes. The camera and the montage remind of a inquisitively blinking child, looking into a different world for the first time, starring at fences with disbelief. Benchmarks of a families history are becoming apparent, names are mentioned and places indicated. But the conversation stays private. Even though, this involves gaps to the not familiar audience, those specific breaks, should be seen as skips and clearances that open an even more all-embracing narrative.'
