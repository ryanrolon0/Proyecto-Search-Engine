The Death of Richard Young

 The Death of Richard Young takes place over the course of five days following the cancer diagnosis of the central character, Richard Young, a man in his early forties. He is married with three children, but his relationship with his family (including his wife) is strained and he wants to gain some semblance of peace before he goes in for surgery. The film follows him through his attempts (and failures) to reconnect with his wife and children before he goes under the knife.
