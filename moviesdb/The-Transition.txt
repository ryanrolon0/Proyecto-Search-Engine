The Transition

 When Adam turns 30, he invites his closest friends over for his 'transition'. Also invited is the 'Fontandu Creations' team, who is able to make it all happen. When done correctly, with the right support from his close society, the transitionee moves from his 20's to his 30's overnight swiftly. As Adam's friends arrive, they share their excitement of this day with the camera. Shortly afterward Fontandu Creations arrives - a crew of experts, which is experienced enough to orchestrate and oversee Adam's transition. Fontandu immediately takes control of the premises and oversees a total overhaul of Adam and his flat and appearance using his five assistants. Color is being gradually removed from Adam and from the flat.
