Screen Snapshots Series 17, No. 5

 This entry in Columbia's long-running Screen Snapshots' series opens in Hollywood with numerous movie stars playing a goofy new game that is the (then) current rage of the film capitol. It moves on to Toluca Lake and further out to Palm Springs with shots of the stars playing golf, tennis, swimming and horseback riding, before heading back to Hollywood for the grand opening of a new Hawaiian-theme nightclub.
