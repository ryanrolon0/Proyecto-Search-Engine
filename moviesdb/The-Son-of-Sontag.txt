The Son of Sontag

 Jack Sontag, son of a western pioneer, bids goodbye to his fiancEe, Beatrice Dale, as she departs for college back east. Jack resumes his pursuit after a gang of smugglers and kidnappers, operating in Mexico, led by Mafia Mike. By a ruse, Jack is accepted into the gang. Meanwhile, Beatrice is kidnapped and brought to Mexico to be sold to the highest bidder among the white-slave trade. Jack rescues her and, with the aid of the Mexican Rurales, rounds up Mafia Mike's gang.
