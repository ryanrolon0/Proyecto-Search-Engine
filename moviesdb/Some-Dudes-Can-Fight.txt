 "A Bowery tough seeing a well-dressed young man approaching decides that it is an opportune time for him to make some unpleasant remarks. The dude at first pays no attention to the rowdy, but when the latter persists in his unwelcome attentions, he is suddenly met with a right-hand swing on the jaw, which is followed by an onslaught so aggressive that in less time than it takes to tell it he is on his back in the gutter begging for mercy."
