The Newman Shower

 It's the summer of 1990 at Camp Colman, and while most of his cabinmates are busy bragging about their sexual exploits, Zach Newman is keeping something secret. Ashamed to shower in front of his friends, he quickly becomes the target of ridicule, threatening his chances with Wendy, the girl he's liked for two summers. When ignoring and fighting back both prove futile, Newman is left with no choice but to do what he has most wanted to avoid... to face them.
