The Ones

 With an ensemble cast caught up in the changing culture around them The Ones focuses on a young women Claire, at the end of a relationship. Experiencing an inordinate series of encounters with the numbers eleven-eleven, seemingly ignited by her break-up with Paul, these coincidences present an intriguing foil to her coolly rational handling of her situation. Her discovery of a web-based new age expert, whose hectoring appearances throughout act as a sort of of a Greek chorus commenting on the narrative adds another element. At films end, Claire is in a better place. Whether her growth has anything to do with the signs she has been taking note of, or a result of her own strength remains tantalizingly uncertain.
