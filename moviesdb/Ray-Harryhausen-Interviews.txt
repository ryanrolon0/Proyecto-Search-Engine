Ray Harryhausen Interviews

 How does one create an introduction to perhaps the finest below-the-line cinema craftsman to ever have lived? Stop-motion animator and filmmaker Ray Harryhausen's achievements and influence are incalculable. Numerous giants in the world of cinema have cited his work, especially in THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD in 1958, as the most profound reason that they attempted a career in films. Mr. Harryhausen has taken upon himself to provide a detailed overview of his career with a new book, An Animated Life, co-written by Tony Dalton. Harryhausen, 87, who retired from making films in 1981, lives in England, but still makes journeys to his hometown of Los Angeles to meet with friends, colleagues and protEgEs. On a 2004 book tour, he took precious time out of his hectic schedule to reflect on the book, his pioneering career, and the future of animation in film in this exclusive 19-minute career-spanning interview, loaded with rare stills from throughout his many films and those of his key influence, Willis (KING KONG) O'Brien.
