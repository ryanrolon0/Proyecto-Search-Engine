Unlucky

 Unlucky is the story of Darren Mackintosh, a likable protagonist with epically bad luck. After a series of ever worsening events convinces Darren that his situation is not just a coincidence, he sets out to get to the bottom of his curse with the help of his highly unqualified psychiatrist, Dr. Frankel. Along the way, things are complicated by an angry mob boss, 2 hard-nosed detectives, belligerent co-workers, an unforgiving boss, an eccentric billionaire, her brow-beaten butler, a Luther Vandross impersonator, a rogue FBI agent, a beautiful stranger, her escaped convict ex-boyfriend, inappropriate landlords, a vicious poodle, and an alien abduction conspiracy. Unlucky is an odd story filled with odd characters in odd situations, but it has an underlying sweetness that will resonate with anyone who has ever felt bullied by the universe.
