Ranger Mike

 The eponymous hero, Ranger Mike, is not going to appear in this film. Instead of him his opponents are in the focus of the story.

After strong battles, the General and his two best companions, the beautiful torture expert Doctor Delilah Jones and the general's right hand Sergeant Hektor C. Johnson, have backed out to a contaminated industrial area. This is the place to decide, whether the General's last mission will be a success or just a terrifying failure. It's still up in the air, and will be till the prisoner Sgt. Hektor made by his last attack on the enemies starts talking. In the end it's just a matter of time.
