Syphon Filter 2

 The sequel to Syphon Filter takes place right after the first one, the Agency has apparently betrayed Gabe Logan and framed him for the Khazakstani ICBM missile launch containing the Syphon Filter virus that was destroyed by him. Upon that, they have captured his partner Lian Xing; who was infected with the virus. As Gabe and some fellow GI's seek refuge from the Agency, their plane is shot down in the Colorado Rockies where Gabe and Lian exchange story paths while in contact with their friend and ex-Agency operative Teresa Lipan.
