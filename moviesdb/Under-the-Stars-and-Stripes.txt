Under the Stars and Stripes

 The story opens in the office of the consul, General Lee, who has just received his passport to leave Cuba. His aide, Captain Locke, who has become enamored with Loretta, the secretary of General Weyler, sees plainly the parting of the ways, when his messenger sends the United States government a message that the peace negotiations are off. A hasty getting together of belongings and an affectionate good-bye and godspeed between Loretta and Captain Locke, who takes the field under his flag. General Weyler, desperate in his efforts to stop the cablegram, orders the bridge blown leading to the cable station. Captain Locke, horse and all go down into the river; he is seen making for the shore, followed by Spaniards. He gains the bank and is off as fast as horse-flesh can carry him. Almost exhausted, he lands his message at the station, and, as the last word is clicked off, with the key still open the cable is cut. The many happening within the next few weeks are best told by the waving of the Stars and Stripes over Morro Castle and the honor with which Locke acquitted himself in battle and claimed his senorita at the eleventh hour, just as she was about to be joined in an unholy marriage to her guardian. International military laws permitted General Weyler to retire and return to the mother country, and with his departure all Cuba rejoiced, happy in the knowledge that they were under the Stars and Stripes.
