The Village Barbershop

 Art Leroldi is widowed and fading - a small time Reno barber stuck in a rut of haircuts and horse-books. When he loses his cutting partner of twenty years, he's faced with closing Reno's last man's man barbershop or hiring the last person on earth he'd ever want working there - a woman. More specifically, Gloria MacIntyre, a broke, spit-fire young woman suddenly unable to take no for answer. This is the story two unlikely people, who meet in one unlikely place - The Village Barbershop.
