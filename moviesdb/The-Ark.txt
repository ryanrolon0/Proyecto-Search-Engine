The Ark

 BRAG Productions introduces us to a modern day Noah and Media phenomenon, Daniel Bennett. Daniel's video blogs, showing increasingly bizarre animal activity, received a huge number of hits and generated an online community who interpret these episodes as signs. Daniel now believes that he is tasked with saving humanity from a global flood that will occur in May 2011.
