Show and Prove

 Show and Prove is the story of the Newark Express basketball organization, year one. For their inaugural season in the ABA Marsha Blount and Jacqui Halyard, the first African American women to own a Professional Sports Franchise have pulled together an impressive collection of talent. They have inked charismatic NBA legend Darryl Dawkins as their head coach. Former Seton Hall All-American Shaheen Holloway is their franchise point guard. The rest of the roster reads like a who's who of Brick City hoops. Add in the vocal support of Newark's (former) showman Mayor Sharpe James and the fans are sure to turn out in droves, cheering along as the Express make an inspiring championship run. But the best laid plans don't always work out. Show and Prove brings you along for the ride as the Express try to navigate a path to basketball glory, all while trying to avoid the sort of business derailment that is all to commonplace in Newark.
