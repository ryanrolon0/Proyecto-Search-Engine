Superglue

 Dave, a starving screenwriter new to LA, is invited for dinner by his distant cousin Paul, an established actor on a daytime soap. Dave initially resists the invitation, but upon hearing that Paul takes gourmet cooking lessons and has an underwear-model girlfriend (Lauren), Dave eagerly accepts. He arrives to find a deliciously aromatic meal cooking, and that Lauren is, indeed, extremely appetizing as well. But what begins as a night of gourmet cuisine and innocent flirtation soon spins out of control, and Dave soon finds himself "stuck" in a situation between Paul and Lauren from which he can only pray he will escape!
