The Conkerers

 Within this school, a frantic contest is being fought with the strangest of weapons conker. Ignoring the ban placed by their terrifying headmaster-Brewster, the students take their battle underground. Ruled by the gigantic school bully Magnus and his henchman Billy, a playground game soon becomes a gauntlet of fear housed deep within the school's catacombs. Now, summoning up every ounce of ingenuity, misfit Maxine and her nerdy pal Stu, must band together to overcome the dark forces that rule... The Conker Club.
