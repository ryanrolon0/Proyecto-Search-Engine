Propheteering

 An interfaith couple can't decide what religion to raise their soon-to-be-born son in. So the two parents summon their respective deity/prophet (Jesus & Moses) to settle their dispute for them. The situation quickly spirals out of control as Jesus and Moses struggle for the soul of the unborn child in a battle of wits and miracles.
