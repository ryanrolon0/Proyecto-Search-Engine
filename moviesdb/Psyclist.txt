Psyclist

 On a casual midsummer day, a cyclist comes across a mountain biker. They decide to race against each other. The cyclist speeds down a winding downhill road, and the mountain biker cuts through the woods. Someone falls. The cyclist wins the race. A little later, after an almost fatal encounter with a careless woman driving a car, the cyclist is provoked by a mysterious black rider. A duel follows. But this time, there's more at stake than winning the race.
