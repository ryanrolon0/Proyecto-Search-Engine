The Fall of Shug McCracken

 When Glasgow City Parks' Department employee Shugie (Hugh) McCracken gets caught red-handed stealing £6.99 to buy booze and ciggies, he blames mice for the crime, claiming that they "ate the tickets". Scared of taking on the Union (who rise to the defence of McCracken) management backs down and to Shug's astonishment he finds himself reinstated.
