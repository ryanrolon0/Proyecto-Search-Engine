The Bitter End

 "The Bitter End" is fast, non-stop paintball played on the mountains of East Tennessee. A random bragging match turns into an all-out paintball battle between the guys team and the girls. The paint starts flying and doesn't let up as each side tries to out-plot, out-wit, and out-shoot the other. As their numbers dwindle their determination only increases. Who will be left standing at the bitter end?
