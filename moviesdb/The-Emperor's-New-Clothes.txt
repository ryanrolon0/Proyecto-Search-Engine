The Emperor's New Clothes

 This animation is inspired by La jetEe (1962). The concept is to tell a known story in a different way which in this case is "The Emperor New Clothes" originally by Andersen. Now, what if the Emperor has his own plan to reveal the terrible secret behind the weavers and his officers?
