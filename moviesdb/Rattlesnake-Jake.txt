Rattlesnake Jake

 In the year eighteen-hundred and forty-eight, there lived gunfighter by the name of Jake. He was known and respected throughout the west by his trademark white hat and patent leather vest. Quick on the draw with deadly precision the town of Gulch was safe under Jake's supervision -- until one day when things went awry and a series of embarrassing events forced our hero to say 'good-bye.' The town he loved, the people he protected had turned on him and made him feel rejected. Well, years passed by as years typically do and then out of nowhere three outlaws made their debut. Bruce, Biff, and Buck Cooper were simply the worst; they harassed, and looted, and fearlessly cursed. They robbed the bank and shot at townspeople, one even set fire to the local church steeple. Yes, the people of Gulch were in quick the pickle, if only their reaction toward Jake hadn't been so fickle! Will our hero forgive? Could he possibly forget? Does he even have it in him to vanquish the threat?
