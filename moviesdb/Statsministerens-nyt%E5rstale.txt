Statsministerens nytårstale

 To begin his third televised New Year's speech Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen tells an anecdote of life in Eastern Europe during Communism and speaks warmly of the new future of a joined, democratic Europe. He defends his controversial position towards the war in Iraq and thanks the soldiers and personnel that serve in international conflicts. He goes on to speak in general words about a number of policy issues such as economical prospects, education, the problem of ghettoes of immigrants and a reform of the structure of local government. He ends by painting a picture of a Denmark that has much to be proud about and which is open to the surrounding world.
