Too Long Fu

 Gangsterboss Big Ossi launches his henchman The Blond, and his nephew Kurt, who is new in business, to bring back Rico, who changed sides with a bag full of cocaine. A simple mission, if there were not a heavenly armed girl-gang called Recalde Sisters, an unknown Chinese assassin girl and a drunken veterinarian. The mission turns out to be more complicated than planned. "Too Long Fu" is a fast and cranky gangster comedy with Austrian accent, but international format.
