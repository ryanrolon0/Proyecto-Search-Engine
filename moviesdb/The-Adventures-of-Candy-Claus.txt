The Adventures of Candy Claus

 When a young girl discovers that Santa Claus gives all the world's children presents but never receives one himself, she makes him a rag doll. Santa's touch brings the doll to life and he takes the child, now named Candy Claus, back to the North Pole to live with him, his wife and his elves.
