The Other Half

 When English Mark surprises his American bride Holly with her dream honeymoon to Portugal she cant believe her luck. Mark goes to great trouble to organise everything for her. They arrive in Portugal to discover that the country is hosting a major international soccer tournament and that the English national team is playing! Whats more, the England team, and their raucous fans, seem to follow them everywhere. Soccer-loving Mark claims innocence - a complete coincidence - after all, what kind of man would lie to his new wife just to watch England play in a tournament? Gradually, Holly is forced to consider that perhaps her husband could be just such a man. Marks odd behaviour, their whirlwind romance and her fathers money (that paid for the trip) all begin to add to a terrible conclusion. The games intensify, the subterfuge deepens and cracks develop. Mark denies everything, but what has he done? How can he prove that he really loves her? The film captures the passion, drama and romance of an explosive match between the hilarious newlyweds playing the game of their lives. An international soccer cup competition, churches, beaches, castles, mountains and the winding streets of Lisbon, all play stadium to this whirlwind ride through beautiful Portugal
