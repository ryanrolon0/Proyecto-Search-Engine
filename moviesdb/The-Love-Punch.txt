The Love Punch

 Felix takes Kitty on a picnic in the woods, but when a bear shows up he flees in panic, leaving Kitty alone to face the animal. Fortunately, a passing prizefighter named Battling Thomas rescues her. When Felix returns, Kitty snubs him. Angry, Felix challenges Battling Thomas to a bout at Madison Square Garden, intending to win Kitty back when he wins the bout--with the help of a new "magic" elixir, "Muck's Marvelous Muscle Maker".
