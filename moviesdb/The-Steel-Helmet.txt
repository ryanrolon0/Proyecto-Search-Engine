The Steel Helmet

 During the Korean War, strong but worn and cantankerous Sergeant Zack is aided by a young, orphaned Korean boy. Together they encounter and join a small group of American soldiers. The group stumbles upon a Buddhist temple where they decide to hold up, believing it to be empty... A hard-bitten, cynical veteran sergeant, the lone survivor of an ambushed patrol, joins up with a South Korean orphan, a black medic, a Japanese-American, a former conscientious objector, and other ragtag stragglers and leads them to an abandoned Buddhist temple. They resist the efforts of a captured North Korean major to divide them along ethnic lines and use their strategically important location to direct American artillery fire onto Communist positions. Stark portrait of G.I.'s at war, this time in Korea. Sgt. Zack has managed to escape after being taken prisoner by the North Koreans and along the way meets up with a young Korean boy, who he nicknames Short Round, and a medic, Cpl. Thompson. They eventually meet up with some men from Zack's unit and set up a forward observation post there to guide artillery fire. They are ordered to get a prisoner for interrogation and capture an English-speaking North Korean Major who does his best to create animosity among the Americans. They soon come under attack, vastly out-numbered and out-gunned.
