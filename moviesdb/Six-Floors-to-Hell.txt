Six Floors to Hell

 Geha Junction, one of the busiest in the Tel Aviv area, hundreds of Palestinians live underground. Young and old, they slip into Israel to find work and bring a small wage home. Their hiding place is in the underground parking garage of an abandoned, unfinished shopping mall, hidden from view despite its location. They pass most nights of the week here, six floors below ground. One of the mall's residents is Jalal who puts up with this hell in order to save money for his wedding while Nisrin, his fiancE, is waiting for him to finish the roof of their new house at Salem in the West Bank. From the darkness emerge still darker forms and ghostly voices. Under subhuman conditions, the men try to preserve their humanity. "In the dark", says Jalal, "the only thing left is to think about is love".
