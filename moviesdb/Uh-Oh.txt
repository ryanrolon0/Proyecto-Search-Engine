Uh Oh

 A little girl gets anything she wants from her parents until her little brother is born and all of the attention moves to him. She tries over and over to get rid of him and is willing to do almost anything to gain her status back. The parents see this and continually punish her for her misbehaving. Through all of this her little brother just wants her love as a sister and just wants to be like her. All traditionally drawn and animated on paper.
