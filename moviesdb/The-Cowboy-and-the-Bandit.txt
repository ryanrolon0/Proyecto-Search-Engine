The Cowboy and the Bandit

 Bill travels to a new state after the outlaw Scarface saves him from a lynch mob. There he takes a job on the Barton ranch and joins in the fight against gang leader Larkin. Finding a wounded Scarface he helps him recover. Arrested by Larkin's stooge Sheriff, and with another lynch mob after him, he once again needs Scarface's help. Wandering cowhand Bill Bodie ('Rex Lease' (qv)), about to be lynched by mistake as a horse thief, is rescued by "Scarface" Jennings ('Richard Alexander (I)' (qv)) and his outlaw gang. Bill rides across the border and rescues young Bobbie Barton ('Bobby Nelson (I)' (qv)) from two of Larkin's henchmen. Larkin holds a note on the Barton ranch, gained in a crooked card game in which Mr. Barton was killed. Bill stays on to help the Bartons. Bobby rescues the injured Scarface from the desert and brings him back to the ranch. Meanwhile, Larkin has bill framed for the killing of Charley Bowen ('Art Mix' (qv)) and jailed. Alice ('Blanche Mehaffey' (qv) as Jeanette Morgan) helps Bill break out of jail while Bobby rides for help from Scarface's gang.
