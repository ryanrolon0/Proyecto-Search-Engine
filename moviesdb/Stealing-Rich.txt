Stealing Rich

 Things are looking up for Seattle surrealist artist Rich Lehl when a film crew arrives to make a documentary about his life and work. But Rich soon finds that the life of a celebrity artist is anything but peaceful. Badgered and belittled by a beautiful sexy interviewer named Tereza, Rich struggles valiantly to hang onto his artistic integrity in a world increasingly governed by crass commercialism and money-hungry wheeler-dealers. As Rich sinks ever deeper into the surreal nightmare world of the celebrity artist, he seeks solace (and wealth) in a strange New Age religion. A cross between Buddhism and voodoo, Buddhivoodoo seems initially to offer salvation, but an elaborate prosperity ritual soon backfires with appalling results. And the weirdness keeps getting deeper Office of Artistic Governance, Rich falls victim to a sadistic government agent who may not even be of this earth; a mysterious stranger arrives in the dead of the night to perform a bizarre medical procedure; meanwhile, his nutty drug-addled wife pursues a dark agenda of her own with the help of a sister she may not even have. When he finds himself trapped in a sinister international art scheme, Rich desperately turns to the only friend he has Rich's paintings through a gallery in Berlin. Trouble is, Rich only gave him three paintings to sell. When Rich finally decides to confront Gitney, everything hits the fan.
