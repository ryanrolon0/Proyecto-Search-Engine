Stasis-Diametric

 A shy young woman mistakenly diagnosed as an alcoholic is placed on probation and forced to attend AA meetings and work a job going door to door collecting charitable contributions. In groups and in work she is unable to communicate with others on an emotional level, and further withdraws into her shell. She slowly builds up her courage and hits the road, meeting 2 young men on the way who are all too similar to her past self and she is forced to walk the road she tried to leave behind.
