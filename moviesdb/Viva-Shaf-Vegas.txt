Viva Shaf Vegas

 Faced with making a lasting marital commitment to his uptight New York girlfriend, PAUL SHAFFER (Musical Director of TV's LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN) seeks life answers to his hip, showbiz problems. Shaffer - along with his existential screenwriter buddy (Tom Leopold) - blow The Big Apple for the some glitz and glitter of flashy, fleshy Las Vegas! "Shaf"'s odyssey for meaning in his life bounces him through tacky Vegas tribute shows, hook ups with wild trailer park babes, the wrath of jealous boyfriends... and ends up making him the star of the tackiest musical production ever to hit Sin City!
