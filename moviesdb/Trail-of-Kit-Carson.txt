Trail of Kit Carson

 Bill Harmon receives a letter from his partner, Dave MacRoy informing him of a rich gold strike in their California mine. Arriving there, Bill learns from elderly miner John Benton that Dave is dead and that he sold the mine at a strangely low price the night before his supposed accidental death. Good-natured and respected physician Doc Ryan shows Bill a check made out to and endorsed by Dave as full payment for the mine. But Doc becomes alarmed at Bill's suspicions and orders his henchmen to get rid of him. Red Synder picks a fight with Bill by insulting Benton's daughter Joan. In the gunfight that follows, Red is killed and through a trick, it is blamed as murder by Bill. He is jailed but escapes and interrupts a meeting between Doc and another secret member of his gang, Trigger Chandler, the town gunsmith.
