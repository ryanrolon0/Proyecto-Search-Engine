Three Missing Links

 The stooges are janitors working in a movie studio. After wrecking the bosses office, they get jobs as actors in an African movie. Curly plays a gorilla and Moe and Larry are primitive natives. On location in Africa, the stooges have a confrontation with a witch doctor from whom Curly buys some "love candy" with hopes of attracting the films leading lady. When a female gorilla disrupts the movie set, Curly eats some of the candy and chases after her.
