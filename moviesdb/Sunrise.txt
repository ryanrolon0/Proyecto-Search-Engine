 In this fable-morality subtitled "A Song of Two Humans", the "evil" temptress is a city woman who bewitches farmer Anses and convinces him to murder his neglected wife, Indre. After Anses comes to his senses - just as he is about to kill Indre - the married couple renew their love in the city. Beginning in summer, we meet a 'woman from the city' on vacation in the country, who we then discover is having an affair with a 'farmer'. The 'woman from the city' then proposes that he drowns his wife so they can run away together. Overwhelmed by the woman from the city, he decides to take his neglected wife for a row in a boat. She gets excited for the date, leaving her child at home, ready for a romantic day with her husband, hoping to rekindle their lost love. Whilst our rowing in the little boat, she senses something is not right. He attempts to push her overboard, but backs out last minute. She then escapes into the city, leaving him to chase after her. Eventually, he proves to her how much he loves her and she comes to forgive him as they share the day together, rekindling their love. On their journey back, a storm begins and his wife falls overboard in a terrible accident. The 'Farmer' returns home, thinking he has lost his wife. The woman from the city hears of her disappearance and runs to the farmer's side thinking he has followed through with their plan. Suffering severe grief and anger, he turns against the woman from the city, but soon hears the news that his wife has been found after an extensive search.
