Rose Petal Place

 Violet prepares for her singing debut at Carnation Hall. Nastina and Horace plot to ruin her performance. Opening night they create a line of laughter and Violet, thinking everyone is laughing at her, runs away. It takes Rose Petal and all their friends to find Violet and convince her to stay in Rose Petal Place. This is the second Rose Petal Place special.
