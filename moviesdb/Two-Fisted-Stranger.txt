Two-Fisted Stranger

 Steve Gordon, alias 'The Durango Kid,' hired to be a Deputy, takes over as Sheriff in place of the one who has been killed because he was getting to close to a swindling scheme engineered by a gang in order to bilk the local ranchers out of their property and cash. The scheme involves salting the local mines with industrial diamonds, and is going very smoothly as none of the ranchers have much knowledge of geology and are scrambling over each other to invest their savings in the worthless mines. Steve shows a lot of incompetence, while his alter-ego, The Durango Kid, is busily cleaning up the gang. Arriving to become the new Deputy, Steve Gordon takes over as Sheriff instead when he finds the Sheriff has been killed. He doesn't last long and is fired for incompetence. But he realizes Brady is pulling off a swindle. Having found the proper soil, Brady has salted it with cheap diamonds, gotten Smiley to accidently find them, and is now taking money from eager investors and planning to flee with it.
