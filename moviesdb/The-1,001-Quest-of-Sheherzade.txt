The 1,001 Quest of Sheherzade

 A 13th century drama inspired by the timeless themes of the Arabian Nights and set during the time of the juggernaut of Genghis Khan, this is the story of the Sufi mystic and prescient nomadic leader Sheherzade, whose quest is to lead her people across the plains of Central Asia to a fabled city where dark-hearted extremists must be overcome if love, brotherhood and the lasting peace of a majestic empire are to be found.
