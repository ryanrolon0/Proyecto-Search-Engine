Screen Snapshots Series 27, No. 3

 Hollywood was always a big sports town, until it actually got some professional sports franchises, and many of the actors around town--- ex-jocks,would-be-jocks or just sports fans---belonged to and played on summer amatuer baseball or softball teams for recreation. And, staging a baseball game between two teams of actors was a good method of raising money for charity. Actors such as Ed Wynn,Kay Kyser,Danny Kaye, Joe E. Brown and Danny Thomas were foremost sports fans, had played the game at the semi-pro or professional level, and were involved in some kind of ownership of sports teams at various times in their careers. The game in this short was for charity and featured the Andy Russell Sprouts against the Frank Sinatra Swooners. Jack Carson and Hal "The Great Gildersleeve" Peary served as umpires in the game, with Mickey Rooney, John Garfield, Keenan Wynn, Peter Lawford, Danny Kaye, Danny Thomas, Jackie Cooper and others as a member of one of the teams. No, they didn't use Mickey Rooney for a base and, no, Peter Lawford didn't show up at a baseball game with a cricket bat. Or, maybe he did.
