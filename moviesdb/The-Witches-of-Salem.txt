The Witches of Salem

 An authentic, chilling account of the 1692 witch-hunting trials. The sensuality of the West Indies. Hypnotic stories of a Barbados slave. References to magic and the Devil. A few young, sheltered, girls experience seizures, hallucinations, inability to speak and cries of pain and an entire community takes their behavior as proof that they are bewitched. Thus, begins the wtich-hunting trials of 1692.
