Revenge of the Whale

 In 1820, a Nantucket whaleship, the Essex, was rammed and sunk by an enraged sperm whale in the Pacific Ocean. Out of 20 crew men, only 8 survived. This is a tale of remarkable courage, endurance and pathos, of men driven to the edge of darkness, forced to make the most awful decisions in order to survive.
