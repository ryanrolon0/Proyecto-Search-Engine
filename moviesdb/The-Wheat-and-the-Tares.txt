The Wheat and the Tares

 A small wooden box-faded red-sits nearly hidden in the black mud of the river bank. In it is a tiny booklet with one of those old stories passed down in high secrecy by fathers to third-born sons. It also contains the order to never share the real title of the story. What can be told is here, in the pseudo-titled 'The Wheat and the Tares.' At its core, this film is about a near-forgotten tradition. That tradition is the underground distribution of knowledge and ideas too dangerous to ever be shared out in the open.
