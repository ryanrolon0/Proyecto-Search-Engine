The D-Monster

 In this animated/live-action surreal fairy tale, a young imaginative girl, Inga Farkas, lands a door opening internship with powerful film executive, Claire Feinstein. Inga's dream of moving up the corporate ladder and one day becoming a writer is crushed when she finds herself thrust into the intern script vault with fierce and unfriendly competition. Here in this Brazil-esque netherworld, where the unpaid workers are kept as work slaves to process scripts for the upper world of executives, things are very bleak. But when impatient Claire fires an intern for using the restroom, Inga finally gets her chance to become office assistant - but not without losing a piece of her innocence. Will she pay the price to stay or will she walk away and find a better path to success?
