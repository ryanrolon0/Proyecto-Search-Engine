Vaudeville

 A cute gal carrying a title card announces each of four acts. The six-member Honey family - three women and three men - perform acrobatics. Reece and Dunn sing a ballad in harmony with piano accompaniment. The Stepping Stars - four women and a man - do a tap dance on stairs that are a giant xylophone. The short concludes with the headliner, Herb Williams, a comedian who first has a contretemps with the orchestra conductor, then, while promising to do a solo standing on his head, engages a trick piano. That's entertainment.
