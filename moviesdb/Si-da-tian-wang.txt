Si da tian wang

 A band of four robbers can steal from a powerful crime syndicate as efficiently as they can rob a jewelry store. But the syndicate doesn't want revenge will be invincible. Three of the four robbers think crime is easy; but their leader, Ma Yi, is more level-headed. Before their adventures are over, the robbers will find themselves traveling from Hong Kong to Thailand; enduring the wrath of the double-crossing syndicate; and suffering the brutality of the police. Meanwhile, Ma Yi must keep the others from gambling away all their stolen loot. But his principles, and his loyalty to his brothers in crime, are more important than the ill-gotten gains.
