The Quartering Act

 Set just days after the Allied Invasion of Normandy, "The Quartering Act" tells the story of a mother's struggle to come to terms with the recent death of her son, a fighter pilot in the Free French Air Force under Charles DeGaulle. Renowned German actress Alexandra Kamp (Antonia, Sumuru) stars as Colette, a woman in stasis, ever-battling to keep her anger at bay. That struggle is intensified as three German deserters on the run with looted gold invade her home, demanding a night's quarter. Coming face-to-face with an enemy she has never known, but one she bitterly resents, Colette is forced to take desperate measures in order to survive the night and hide her crimes from her captors. Fellow German star John Friedmann (Erkan and Stefan) makes his US film debut as Werner, a disillusioned former officer who both deeply distrusts and is simultaneously fascinated by Colette's plight. Friedmann's compatriots include up-and-coming German television and film actor Philippe Reinhardt and French native Tom Vlay. "The Quartering Act" is a jagged look at the damaging toll grief takes on the human spirit.
