The Funeral Arriving at Hyde Park

 No more notable film has ever been shown in moving pictures. It depicts clearly all the crowned heads and titled personages taking part in the great pageant, together with the military notables and attaches. Also the gun carriage bearing the royal casket, surrounded by the escort and guard of the Household Cavalry. The gun carriage is drawn by the eight cream colored Flemish horses with Crimson trappings and scarlet clad grooms, that was last seen in London when they drew the Queen through the streets on the day of the Diamond Jubilee. This is a fine film and taken in connection with the other films makes a complete pictorial illustration of the obsequies of Queen Victoria.
