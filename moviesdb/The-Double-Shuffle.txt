The Double Shuffle

 A working class man tries to make sense of a nightmarish recurring dream of a car crash involving him. As he delves deeper, his fickle sense of reality and dream states intertwine to such an extent that he finds his life in grave danger when seduced by two beautiful women who are on the run from a sadistic gangster. As he tries to escape to save his life, his car crashes. Does he really die or is still trapped in an inexplicable void?
