Swallow

 Meet Gideon Swallow -- scientist, environmentalist, rock star. Young, British, and devastatingly handsome, he teaches Environmental Science at Pomona State University. His message -- of respecting the environment and saving the planet -- is wildly popular with his students, many of whom think he is a genius. Others think he is just trying to get laid. We will find out as the new schoolyear begins... Swallow has a new student in his class alienated from her peers, with daddy issues. She is drawn to Swallow like a moth to the flame. He seduces her - to the surprise of no one makes a habit of these freshman conquests. But Angie is different. She's not as stable as she first appeared. Her love for Swallow becomes obsessive, and then pathological. In a misguided attempt at eco-terrorism, she chains herself to a tree in the middle of nowhere, sentencing herself to death. It is finally up to Swallow to find her, to save her, and show her the path to sanity and salvation (right after he has sex with her in the forest.)
