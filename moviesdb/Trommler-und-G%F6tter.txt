Trommler und Götter

 The documentary "Drums and Gods" does not aim to present music as a well-packaged product through virtuosity to be consumed effortlessly. Instead, the film attempts to present music as the means that ancient man used to (re) find himself, actively living and experimenting music. Set against the colorful, lively background of the musical life of Salvador da Bahia in Brazil, the film intends to show how today man still tries, through music, to come to an agreement with his lost wholeness, to retake possession, re-unite himself, finding peace and harmony. Re-tie, religion from the Latin "re-ligere", the exact original meaning. This curative function demonstrates the religious origin of music.
