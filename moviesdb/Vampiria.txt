Vampiria

 When Claudia steals her co-worker's (Babs) boyfriend. Babs comes to visit Claudia to express her unhappiness. As both try to top the other, Babs spikes Claudia's drink and now has her captive until Babs finds out something startling as Claudia turns the tables and has the upper hand (for a while anyway) until both bare their claws and fangs as two angry, sexy vampire women vie for bloody revenge and total control.
