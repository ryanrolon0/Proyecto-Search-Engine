The Hunt for the Boston Strangler

 Police closed the case of the infamous Boston Strangler when handyman Albert De Salvo confessed to the grisly murder of 13 women. But recent forensic evidence reveals that in at least one of the murders - and possibly all of them - police may have had the wrong man. Some even theorize that the strangler may be walking free today. Now, the National Geographic Channel investigates in The Hunt for the Boston Strangler.
