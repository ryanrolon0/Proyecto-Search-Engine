Six Point Nine

 At 6 AM in LA, a solitary man gets the newspaper from his front mat and heads for the toilet, to shave, brush and floss his teeth, and sit down for a read. One headline is, "Tenants want quake safety." In the next apartment, the clock radio goes off, blaring Latin music; a young couple and their baby wake. Their talk becomes an argument about the loud music, then some tickling, laughter, and a return to bed. As the man in the bathroom sits, the couple's bedstead bangs rhythmically against the wall, harder and harder the basin, the toothbrush glass shatters, car alarms go off. Good sex or a 6.9 earthquake?
