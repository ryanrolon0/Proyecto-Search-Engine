 Buddy Johnson recounts the story of his life to a lovely woman who comes into his bar (lounge singing) from an early age by their mother, how her Atlantic City bar was swindled from her, and how they managed to steal three hundred thousand dollars from a cheap hood. Is it fact? Is it fiction? Or does he just want to get into her pants?
