Tornado Boy

 Henry is 12 or 13, spending the summer with his grandparents at their house on Cape Cod. There's nothing much to do. Henry is convinced he needs to be prepared in case of tornadoes. His grandmother thinks differently and suggests that Henry call "that Pratchett boy" and make a friend. Some stagnant activities with the Pratchett lad follow - including setting a small fire with gasoline and peeping through the window of the cute girl down the street. Will dreams of meeting the girl and of being prepared for a tornado bring the summer to an heroic climax?
