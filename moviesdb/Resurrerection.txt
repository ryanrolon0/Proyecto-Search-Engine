Resurrerection

 A cut-out animation film made in response to the on-going revelations of the systematic abuse of Ireland's children by Ireland's priests. In the film, images of Christ are juxtaposed with images of Ireland's priests and bishops, played out against a background of abuse. Christ was betrayed and crucified, as were a generation of Ireland's children. The only difference is that the latter really did happen.
