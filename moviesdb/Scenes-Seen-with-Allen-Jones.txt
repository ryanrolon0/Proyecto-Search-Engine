Scenes Seen with Allen Jones

 During his days as a top member of the Pop Art movement in Britain, Jones had evolved a singular genre of imagery sheathed in vinyl, which have become his artistic "icons." His graphic works, drawings, paintings and sculptures all had erotic overtones. Jones is introduced in his London studio, where he is developing an idea for a new painting as he studies his model - a woman clad in vinyl. Other scenes include a visit to a London tailor, where the artist's wife is being fitted with one of Jones' costume designs for the movie "A Clockwork Orange" and a rehearsal of an eccentric stage musical also featuring costumes designed by the artist.
