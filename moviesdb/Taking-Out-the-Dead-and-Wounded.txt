Taking Out the Dead and Wounded

 This is a heart-rending scene and moves one to tears. The dead and wounded are taken from the ruins, many of whom are so disfigured that they are beyond recognition. The little band of rescuers are to be commended for their bravery in risking their lives in the ruins, not knowing when another eruption might take place when they might all be destroyed.
