Sid & Lenny

 Lenny can talk his way out of...just about anything. So when he steals from the city's most ruthless crime boss, he heads straight to his well connected best friend for help in this wise-cracking, irreverent, gangster-buddy-comedy based on the improvisational performances of Ron Morgan and Paul Eenhoorn.
