Rendezvous in New York

 A live concert movie shot during the recording of the Grammy-winning album, "Rendezvous In New York", offering a historical, unprecedented musical retrospective of contemporary jazz told from the viewpoint of legendary pianist, Chick Corea, who reunites nine different bands he's led over his illustrious career in a once-in-a-lifetime event. Captured in 24p High Definition TV and Digital Surround Sound at the famed Blue Note club in New York City, "Rendezvous in New York" features highlights of performances by over twenty musical heavyweights such as Bobby McFerrin, Joshua Redman, Terence Blanchard, Michael Brecker, Steve Gadd and Christian McBride. To better understand the man universally regarded as "King of the Keyboard", the film also follows Chick and his fellow band members off stage for rare intimate reflections on a lifetime of musical partners, collaborations and creative adventures. Narrated by Jeff Goldblum ("Jurassic Park"; "Independence Day").
