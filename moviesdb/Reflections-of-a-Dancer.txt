Reflections of a Dancer

 This intimate introduction to the life and art of Russian prima ballerina Alexandra Danilova offers a vivid portrait of the legendary dancer and documents an extraordinary career. She trained at the renowned Imperial Ballet School, where she met choreographer George Balanchine. Danilova left Russia in 1924 and went on to become America's favorite ballerina as the star of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo for nearly 20 years. Her later years were spent teaching and coaching young dancers at the School of American Ballet. From there, she shares memories of her life and stages an engaging performance of "Paquita" with her long-time partner, Frederic Franklin.
