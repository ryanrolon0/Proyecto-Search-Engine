War of the Range

 Jim Warren is starting a range war by getting his boss Duke Bradley to fence off part of the range used by other ranchers. This pits father against son when Tom Bradley sides with a newly arrived nester family. Then after stealing Duke Bradley's money, Warren frames Duke's son Tom for the theft.
