StarE povesti ceskE

 Excellent stop-motion animation film from one of the best Czech filmmakers, Jirí Trnka. It tells the ancient story of Czechoslovakia, how it was founded by Czech, the Forefather, and a series of legendary episodes of heroes, queens and kings, inspired in a book by Alois Jirásek compiling the Czech myths.
