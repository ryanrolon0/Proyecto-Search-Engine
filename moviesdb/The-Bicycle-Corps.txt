The Bicycle Corps

 At the end of the 19th century, many military experts believed that the bicycle could replace the horse as a means of transporting troops. The colored 25th Infantry was chosen to test that theory. On June 14 1897 a small group of African-American soldiers, led by white officers and accompanied by a local newspaper reporter, departed Fort Missoula, Montana. Forty-one days and over 1,900 miles later, they reached their destination--St. Louis, Missouri--after traveling over every possible type of rugged terrain and enduring every kind of bad weather. This documentary film looks at how the Bicycle Corps came into being, and details the progress and hardships of their amazing journey.
