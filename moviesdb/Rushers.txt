Rushers

 Twenty-seven-year-old free spirit Tanner Easley has a plan to help his twenty-five-year-old workaholic brother, Kyle, lighten the hell up. When Kyle discovers Tanner's plan is to pose as college students and crash fraternity Rush Week - he's already neck-deep in free beer and hot coeds. In this effervescent, intelligent comedy - age is relative. Because "you're never too old, for the time of your life!"
