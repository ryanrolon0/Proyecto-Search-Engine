 The plot has Erszebet Simor falling in love with Gabor Rajnay, who has a wife in Paris, but he has told everybody she is dead. Erszebet, via a little scheming and a direct appeal to the not-dead wife, gets Rajnay a divorce so she can marry him. The not-dead wife probably figured that as good riddance.
