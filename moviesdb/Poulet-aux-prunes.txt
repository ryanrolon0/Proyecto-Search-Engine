Poulet aux prunes

 Nasser-Ali, a talented musician, meets his beloved, Irane, in the streets. But she doesn't recognize him. Following this encounter we find that after an argument with his wife, Nasser-Ali's beloved tar (an Iranian instrument) was broken. He searches for a replacement, and, finding none, he vows to die. Eight days later, he does. This is the story of his last week of life, where we see flashbacks and flash forwards of his previous life and his children's futures. We also see appearances of a nude Sophia Loren as well as the angel of death, Azarel. As we see his life, we realize exactly why he chose to end his life, and the profundity of this choice.
