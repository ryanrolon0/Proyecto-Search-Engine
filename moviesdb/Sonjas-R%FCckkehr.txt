Sonjas Rückkehr

 After many years in jail, Sonjas returns to her home village where she takes up her fight for custody of her 8-year old son Tim. But neither the authorities, nor her in-laws, nor Tims foster parents will ever consider handing over little Tim to Sonja, a purported spouse killer. Sonja must bring light into her dark past if she is to win back Tim's love. Tobias Ineichen's film is led by Melanie Winiger, one of Switzerland's brightest talents.
