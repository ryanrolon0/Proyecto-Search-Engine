The Less Gone

 A short thriller/drama (think A Beautiful Mind) about an isolated man who exits a fallout shelter one year after a nuclear apocalypse has decimated the United States. Through a series of flashbacks, the events leading up to the attack are unraveled to reveal a shocking revelation as it seems.
