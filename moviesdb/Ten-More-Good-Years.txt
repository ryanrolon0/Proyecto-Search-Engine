Ten More Good Years

 LGBT Elders often age alone, without financial stability and at times find themselves returning to the closet. These issues are all but ignored by the government so the LGBT Community is finding ways to resolve these problems on their own. Ten More Good Years sheds light on the issues and offers hope for the future should we decide as a community to embrace everyone regardless of age. Ten More Good Years follows four LGBT elders and explores the reasons why so many in this community age alone, without financial stability and often return to the closet. We meet men and women who work in the field of aging that help to explain why it is that so many of our Heros have been left behind. Yet there is hope; one thing the AIDS crisis taught the world is that LGBT people take care of their own. While the government continues to ignore the unique challenges and concerns these elders are facing, the gay community is finding ways to care for themselves. Ten More Good Years sheds light on the injustices LGBT elders are facing and offers hope for the future.
