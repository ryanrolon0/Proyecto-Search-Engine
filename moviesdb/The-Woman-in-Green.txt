The Woman in Green

 Holmes and Watson investigate a series of bizarre and apparently unconnected murders, and the death of a possible suspect. The trail leads to a society of hypnotists and a mysterious, glamoruos woman. The fiendish Dr Moriarty, though reported hanged in Montevideo, is belived to be involved. A serial killer appears to be on the loose in London and Sherlock Holmes assists Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard in the investigation. Holmes is brought into the case when Maude Fenwick asks him to investigate her father, Sir George Fenwick, who has been acting very oddly of late. Holmes had seen him in a hotel bar a few nights before with a very attractive and mysterious woman. He traces her to a club for hypnotists and eventually to his archenemy, Professor Moriarty.
