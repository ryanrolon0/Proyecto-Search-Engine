Wanderlust

 Eva is a beautiful drifter who propositions couples to make love in front of her. George is a young recluse who fills his days creating soundscapes in his bedroom. They are two misfits from very different worlds but with one thing in common - Synesthesia, a rare condition of feeling one sense as another. Thrust into each others lives by a misguided psychiatrist, they are forced to take their search for sensory fulfilment to visceral new depths, confronting their innermost fears and desires.
