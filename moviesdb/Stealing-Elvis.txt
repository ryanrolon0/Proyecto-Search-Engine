Stealing Elvis

 Summer in leafy North London. Eager for a slice of the easy life they see around them, Frank and Danny pull an audacious heist worth an easy two million. Instead of lying low and waiting for the heat to cool, they go out on town to celebrate. School's out for Kristina and Alice, seventeen and out for trouble. They hook up with Frank and Danny in a bid for adventure. When they discover the proceeds of the robbery, they plot to steal it for themselves. Once in possession of the cash, the girls hide out in a local hotel... but the boys are hot on their trail. A dramatic confrontation leaves Frank fighting for his life, and Kristina having to resort to ever more ingenious measures to ensure that she ends up with the money.
