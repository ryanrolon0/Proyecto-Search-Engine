Rent Party

 Your roommate just spent the rent money, your weed is missing, and you just stumbled into a neighbor's garage. What do you do? For Hank, Geoff, and Penny, it's an easy choice... you throw a Rent Party! Rent Party was originally made as part of the Little Rock 48 Hour Film Project. This is the Director's Cut version put together using footage shot during the LR 48HFF weekend.
