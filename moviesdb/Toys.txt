Toys

 An eccentric toymaker's last wish is that his brother takes over the running of the business. The brother is a military General, and is out of touch with toymaking, and out of touch with reality too. The business should really have been given to Leslie, who was much more like his toymaking father. When the General starts making weapons instead of toys, Leslie decides to take action. Leslie Zevo is the son of an eccentric toy maker. While Leslie was closest to his father and works as a toymaker himself, his Military General Uncle, Leland Zevo, inherits the toy making factory and begins making war toys. Leslie, however, does not see eye to eye with his Uncle, as his father had a policy against making War toys. When the General begins making live weaponry behind Leslie's back, and recruiting children to pilot his army, Leslie, his friends, and his family band together to put an end to the General's tyranny.
