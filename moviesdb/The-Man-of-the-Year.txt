The Man of the Year

 Michael Thibodeaux lives in post-Katrina New Orleans, making a marginal living as a repo man. However, when he accidentally kills a despised neighborhood thug during a routine repossession, he is suddenly elevated to the rank of local hero. As Michael begins handling all sorts of problems for his neighbors, he descends into a violent, lawless hell, completely losing his moral bearing. We watch, transfixed, hoping against hope that Michael will find his way back before it's too late.
