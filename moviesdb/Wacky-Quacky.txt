Wacky Quacky

 In this Columbia Color-Phantasy (the ones in black & white were called Phantasy but this is in Technicolor and Columbia labeled them as Color Phantasy/Phantasies) is a role reversal when a hunter sets his sights on Quacky the Duck, and the hunter soon finds himself being pursued by Quacky.
