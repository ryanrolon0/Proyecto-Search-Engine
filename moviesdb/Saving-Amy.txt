Saving Amy

 When fifteen-year-old Amy is raped by her mother's boyfriend, she flees into a sinister world of streetwise opportunists and predators. The callous No-Neck and his cross-dressing sidekick Shithead try to force her into prostitution. The deranged Fagin-like Lou wants her as a sex prisoner. Then there is Peter, mum's paedophile boyfriend, who wishes to silence her for ever. Ken, a young street magician, comes to Amy's aid. But he will need all his resourcefulness to help her. Charismatic and mysterious, with a touch, perhaps, of the supernatural, he becomes Amy's mentor and guide through the most dangerous day of her life. Dark, but also funny and deeply poignant, this is a story about growing up and hope.
