Tortilla Flaps

 A hungry crow intrudes on a party honoring Speedy Gonzales, Mexico's fastest mouse, and tries to catch and eat some of Speedy's friends. Speedy leads the crow on a frustrating and violent chase that demoralizes the crow into surrendering and joining in Speedy's party, as the center of a dart board, and the target of a ball-throw.
