Too Much Aunt

 The spirit of deviltry has been well developed in the boy, and his father believes that " to spare the rod is to spoil the child." In the family, however, there is a doting aunt and a loving mother who are inclined to spoil the youth by excess of cuddling. The youngster takes every advantage of their weakness and on one occasion to remain away from the hated school, he has only to pretend to be suddenly affected with a violent " tummyache." He is successful as far as his mother and aunt are concerned and he is assured of a day at home, until the father takes a hand. He has every reason to suspect the young man is bluffing and to make sure calls in a doctor, who on arriving, at once pronounces the lad's complaint a simple case of " Hookyites." Then, in spite of the tearful protests of Clarence's champions, the father takes the matter into his own hands and administers the slipper with well applied onslaughts. The young man is completely cured, and starts to school with no great anxiety to sit down, but firmly convinced that the old man knows his business.
