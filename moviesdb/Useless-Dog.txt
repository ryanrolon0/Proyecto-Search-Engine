Useless Dog

 Trevor Wardrop, a sheep rancher in Ireland, tells us about his useless dog Guiness. Trevor goes through a litany of her faults who shies away from sheep; 49 years old in dog years and set in her ways; cowardly and narcoleptic; and, able to pass these traits on to at least one of her pups, Scamp. As Trevor talks, we watch Guiness, truly useless, but one of the family.
