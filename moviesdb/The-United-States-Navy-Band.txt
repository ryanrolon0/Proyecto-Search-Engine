The United States Navy Band

 The U.S. Navy Band, conducted by Charles Brendler, stands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. They play "Anchors Away" as we see footage of ships at sea. After a swing tune and a march, the camera into the the Memorial as the band and chorus perform a slow version of "Don't Give Up the Ship." A family of grandfather, sailor, and two lads stand before the statue of Lincoln. The band then goes up-tempo as we see reenactment footage of a 1779 encounter between the USS Bonhomme Richard and HMS Serapis. We transition from John Paul Jones to an image of Admiral E.J. King and contemporary war footage. Back on the steps of the Memorial, the band forms a "V" for its final number.
