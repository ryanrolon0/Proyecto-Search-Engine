Shadow Tracing

 In 'Shadow Tracing', a short experimental film, narrative fiction straddles historical and cultural timelines. By-passing window displays of lingerie, a young woman decides to buy a vintage hand-crank movie camera. She dreams of events the camera may have seen. Recalling 'wacky' Hollywood impressions of 'Chinatown', she has dreams of becoming a 'cameraman' herself, later fulfilled in the streets of her 'hood', Toronto's Asian cultural community.
