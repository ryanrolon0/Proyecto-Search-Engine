Pure Vengeance

 Evil druglord Brigman wants a test subject for his new performance-enhancing drug "Deadly Jade" so he kidnaps Danny, an expert martial artist. Unfortunately Brigman's crazy second-in-command Eddie kills Danny's girlfriend, sending Danny into a rage. He tries to escape but Brigman force-feeds him an overdose of Deadly Jade, sending Danny's combat potential into overdrive. Danny decimates Brigman's henchmen before facing Brigman himself, who has also decided to have a taste of the drug. This leads to a climactic martial arts showdown between them, ending in Danny killing Brigman, before succumbing to the side effects of Deadly Jade, spiralling down into the depths of madness amidst the chaos of the battle.
