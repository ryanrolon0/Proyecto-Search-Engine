The Turning Point

 The Turning Point - A Return to Community explores the vital importance of community in the 21st century and its role in helping us create a life sustaining society for the benefit of all. Peak oil and climate change present enormous and unprecedented challenges to society as well as significant opportunities. 'The Turning Point - A Return to Community' seeks to inspire and motivate people to embrace the coming changes with enthusiasm rather than despair and paralysis. The film features practical examples of 'low carbon' enterprises in and around the Findhorn Foundation community, particularly local food and energy production and interview material with pioneers in the fields of global change and human ecology including Richard Heinberg, Joanna Macy and Rob Hopkins.
