Savage Drums

 There is this little small-island kingdom located off the South China coast and the United States offers a pact of economic aid and military assistance if needed. But there is this Asiatic Communist nation/power---not identified but the name starts with 'C'--- that does not want this treaty to be signed, for whatever reason those Commie-nations have for doing whatever it is they are doing, and they have a plan going to thwart the treaty. Then the island King-inheritor, Sabu, playing a tic-tac-toe role name, comes home. Sabu does this at a large sacrifice, as he had to give up his promising career as a world-class prizefighter in the United States. But he has little choice as his brother, the prior King, had been murdered and if there was anything kingdoms were big on, it was keeping the royal crown in the hands of one family. Sabu, after accepting accolades from the citizens, snoops around and discovers that his cousin, who has reigned for a brief period between the murder of the previous family-member King and the return of Sabu, is the leader of the faction opposing the treaty. Well, right behind the rulers of "C", that is. But Sabu has a guy from Texas and another one from Brooklyn helping him, so that evens the odds in his favor.
