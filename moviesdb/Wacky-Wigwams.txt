Wacky Wigwams

 A cartoon satire---yes, it is now politically incorrect---on Indian life on and off the reservation. It is filled with black-out sight gags, word-play and caricatures involving pottery-making, rug-weaving and totem poles, and some well-known historical native-americans---Sitting Bull and others---are satirized.
