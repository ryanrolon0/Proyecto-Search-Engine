Shen jian zhen jiang hu

 A clan sends out two of their members (Lo Lieh and Chang Yi) to retrieve a powerful sword to prevent its misuse. Along the way they encounter a skilled swords-woman who is also after the sword (Cheng Pei-pei). A complex love tragedy develops when she falls in love with one of the men and thoughtlessly wounds the other. Though the sword is found it becomes secondary to the love story and the guilt of the woman over her hasty and violent actions towards her lovers clan.
