Sam the Super Sticky

 'Sam the Super Sticky' is an animated short depicting the epic mini-adventure of the world's first sticky-note hero, Sam. When Sam's leisurely stroll is interrupted by the hungry Dino-sticky he must outwit his belligerent pursuer or else succumb to his carnivorous jaws. The action of the supernatural characters takes place within the realm of the everyday world but just beyond the knowledge or recognition of its human inhabitants. The film was created using an experimental mix of hand-drawn and stop-motion animation techniques and tricks.
