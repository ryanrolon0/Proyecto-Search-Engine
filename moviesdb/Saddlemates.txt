Saddlemates

 In this remake of "Ride, Ranger, Ride" (1936), Texas Rangers Stony Brooke, Tucson Smith and Lullaby Joslin (The Three Mesquiteers) are detailed by Ranger Captain Miller, of the Red River Ranger Patrol, to seek an elusive Indian chieftain named Wanechee who is constantly stirring up trouble. They return and learn that a boundary change has placed their district out of the Rangers' jurisdiction, and it is now to be patrolled by the United States Army. Because of their familiarity with the territory,terrain and Indian ways, Captain Miller turns over the Mesquiteers to Colonel Langley, commander of the new army post. They are reluctant at first but the Colonel's beautiful daughter, Susan Langley, persuades them to stay with the assignment. They meet with considerable antagonism from Lieutenant Manning, Langley's second-in-command. When they suspect the motives of Le Roque, the half-breed official interpreter of the post, Manning disregards their suspicions, and is responsible for placing them under military arrest for starting a brawl involving Le Roque. When a strip of land along the Red River is declared in Indian Territory instead of Texas, the Rangers leave and the Army moves in. Now ex-rangers the Mesquiteers stay on as scouts. The new Colonel plans to make peace with the Indians but unknown to him the notorious Indian Wanechee is posing as his interpreter. The Mesquiteers learn of the masquerade but are not beleived and instead are arrested just as Wanechee moves to wipe out the arriving wagon train.
