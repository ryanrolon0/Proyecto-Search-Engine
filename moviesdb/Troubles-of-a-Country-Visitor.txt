Troubles of a Country Visitor

 This picture shows a stranger in the city trying to stop the car by waving his umbrella, but the gripman is busy talking to a young lady and does not see him. A street Arab tells our country friend to drop a nickel in the cable slot and the car will stop; well, our friend drops his nickel, and while he is looking down in the slot a car comes along and stops--but the stranger starts, goes up in the air and then he stops. Too funny to try to describe. Send for it; it is great.
