The Second Jungle Book

 Pre-teen jungle boy Mowgli gets to human world and is pursued by P.T.Barnum circus scout Harrison who wants to take him to circus as curiosity. Harrison hires local grandee Buldeo for help in tracking Mowgli down. It turns out to be that Mowgli is Buldeo's nephew, and the only obstacle for him to take his late brother's rich estate. Circa India in 1880, Young Mowgli's father is devoured by Sher Khan, the tiger, while the youngster takes shelter with a pack of wolves. He grows up in the jungles, and is befriended by Bagheera, a black panther; Baloo, a black bear, as well as his brother Greywolf. At the age of 10, Mowgli ventures out to the human world, and returns home with a trained monkey, the wolves refuse to take him back, and he is treated as an outcast. Alone, without his jungle friends to assist him, he becomes the target of two large apes; a jungle tracker with a huge python; Harrison, who wants to abduct Mowgli, take him to America and make him perform in the P.T. Barnum Circus; Sher Khan, who wants to kill and feast on this man-cub; and his vengeful paternal uncle, Baldev, who wants him dead at any and all costs so that he could keep the inheritance for himself,
