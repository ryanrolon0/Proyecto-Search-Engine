Triangulum

 On the edge of the abyss a troupe of three meets faith, who appears in the form of a young woman. They are transported to an eastern metropolis, not knowing where to go or what to do. Random signs are the only directions to follow and will lead each one of them on a different journey. In perpetual movement, paranoids, they go further in search of balance.
