The Gypsy Vanner Horse

 A select group of Gypsies and Traveling families of the British Isles have devoted generations to developing a special type of horse. The age of motorcars changed the role of the horse drawn living wagon to an elaborate decorative cultural icon used mainly for holidays and festivals. The horses originally bred to pull these wagons have also evolved to compliment the art of the wagons. A chance meeting in England eventually brought these wonderful horses to America and ignited a passion in horse lovers from all walks. A new breed has been established around this magical gentle horse now known as the Gypsy Vanner Horse.
