The Royal Mounted Rides Again

 Mine owner Jackson Decker orders his manager to obtain Tom Bailey's milling machinery no matter what the cost. When Bailey is found murdered, suspicion naturally falls upon the mine owner and his son, a Canadian Mountie, is ordered to find the real culprit. He joins forces with a French-Canadian constable, Bailey's beautiful daughter and a phony palm reader to learn the truth and discovers a secret gold mine, a double-crossing casino owner and a forger at the bottom of the conspiracy.
