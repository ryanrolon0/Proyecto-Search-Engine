The Mecca

 An unending story set in a small diner in Dallas, Texas. 6 scenarios represent the categories that make up the Cancer fighting fund raiser film festival in Dallas called The Deep Ellum Film Festival. Originally shot to as a short but eventually it's broken up in to small vignettes that still run in the current festival events. A very twin peaks like vibe but with a twist that is really a twist.
