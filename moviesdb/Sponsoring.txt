 Anne, a Parisian journalist, leads a pleasant life juggling family, work and leisure. She is investigating student prostitution. She meets Alicja, a Polish student whose persona is troubling and seductive and Charlotte, a French woman, more reserved and viewing her prostitution as part of a bitter social struggle. Having "clients" allows the two women to continue their studies. Anne is sensitive to the students' social realities, but little by little their stories touch her more profoundly, leading her to question her own assumptions and sexuality.
