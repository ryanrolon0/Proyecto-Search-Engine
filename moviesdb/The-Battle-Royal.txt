The Battle Royal

 In the hills of Kentucky, the Plumps and the Runts are neighbors and bootleggers. Peter Plump is in love with one of the Runts, and her brother is in love with one of the Plumps. The courting and the spooning go well until Peter and his future brother-in-law hook the same fish and start a fight over whose it is. The fracas escalates, and soon the two families are shooting at each other. If love can't bring the two sides back together, what can?
