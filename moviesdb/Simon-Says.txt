Simon Says

 The pothead Zack; the sweethearts Kate and Riff; the slut Vicky; and the spoiled Ashley travel by van to the backwoods to camp. They meet two strange gravediggers that advise them to leave the place otherwise they could be murdered. Then they meet the deranged retarded Simon in the gas station and Riff has a friction with the guy. They find a paradisiac spot to camp at the riverside, but Simon and Stanley transform their holiday in a nightmarish night. Five college friends choose to spend their vacation debauching at the riverside. They find the perfect place to camp out, but end up crossing paths with twin brothers, Simon and Stanley. The twins then begins to knock off the campers in some extremely creative (and extremely gruesome) ways. Enjoy the splatter.
