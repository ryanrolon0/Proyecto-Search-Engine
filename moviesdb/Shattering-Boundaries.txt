Shattering Boundaries

 The story of a courageous painter who, along with her friends Jackson Pollock and Willem deKooning, was a key figure in the Abstract Expressionist movement in American art. A major artist who refused to be categorized, Grace Hartigan continually invented and reinvented herself and her style and persevered in the face of profound personal and professional challenges most influential art critics of the time; an attempted suicide; an estrangement from her only child; and the long, tragic illness and death of her beloved (and 4th) husband. Against the background of one the most explosive periods in American art history, this film celebrates a fiercely independent painter whose life was as gutsy and compelling as her art.
