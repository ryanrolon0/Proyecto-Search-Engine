Vampire Vixens from Venus

 Three Venusians land on Earth and transform themselves into beautiful buxom babes, then go about their task of sucking the life force out of unsuspecting males. Their disguises are a propos since the life force is more valuable when extracted at a moment of extreme sexual excitement. Meanwhile, Detective Oakenshield bumbles his way into the investigation of the dessicated bodies while trying to impress his new partner Jack and his new love interest Shampay.
