Talk About It

 No one wants talk about it, but diarrhea is the second leading killer of children around the world. It kills about 4000 children per day, which is more than HIV/AIDS, famine, and war. This is especially tragic because we know how to defeat it with simple, proven solutions that are available today. All we need is the political will to fight this illness, and we can get that political will if we starting talking about it.
