Two-Lip Time

 Felix chases a mouse onto a ship, gets seasick, and eventually finds himself in Holland. He flirts with a local Dutch girl and angers a local man who hits him in the head with a wooden shoe. He makes a deal with another man for a dish of milk in exchange for watering the man's plants, but Felix accidentally puts gin into the watering can and gets the plants drunk.
