Surviving Hunger

 This is a short film animation produced by Song, Balgum. The animation is placed on a desert-like landscape where there are just sands and dry air with no foods. I am using two characters for this storyline. One is a big frog-looking character who wonders around for food. The other is a cute little character that comes towards the big character to use himself as a bait. The story is going to be a conflict between these two characters.
