Twelve Hours to Kill

 Based on the Saturday Evening Post serial "Set Up For Murder" by Richard Stern, 12 Hours to Kill traces the problems of a young Greek national (Nico Minardos) who, after ogling a murder, is ushered off into the relative "safety" of suburban obscurity by the police, unaware that he is being double-crossed by a crooked gendarme.
