Pretty Polly

 Miss Poly decides to spend a few months with her wealthy spinster aunt as a traveling companion. While in India her Aunt's demise leaves her alone to persue her freedom and explore an arms length romance with a local boy. Tender, fun loving, and poetic representation of that transition from youth to young womanhood.
