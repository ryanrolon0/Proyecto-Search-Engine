The House Builder-Upper

 Olive's house burned down; Popeye and Wimpy arrive too late to save it, but they agree to rebuild it. They nearly complete it, in their somewhat unorthodox way, when it collapses. Popeye has his spinach and rebuilds the whole thing, even better, in 5 seconds flat. But when Olive walks in, it collapses again.
