Reason and Emotion

 A look inside the brain, where we see Emotion (a caveman) ruling the infant, with Reason in the driver's seat for adults most of the time. We're shown the consequences when emotion takes over, and then we see how Hitler has manipulated his populace so that Emotion has put Reason in a concentration camp. Finally, we're exhorted to keep emotion in check to help us win the war, by not paying attention to rumors and getting discouraged with minor setbacks (but still having emotional pride in our country).
