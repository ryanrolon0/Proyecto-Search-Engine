Sons of the Pioneers

 Night raiders are burning down the ranchers' barns and poisoning their cattle. Sheriff Gabby, unable to cope, goes east to get help from Roy, descendent of two famous sheriffs. Roy is a young entomologist who would rather study bugs than strap on guns. He finally gives in to Gabby's wishes and ends the terror. Songs include "He's Gone Up The Trail," "Come And Get It," "Things Are Never What They Seem," Trail Herdin' Cowboy," and "The West Is In My Soul."
