The Lone Rider in Texas Justice

 The 9th film of PRC's "Lone Rider" series finds rancher Jack Stewart, after innocently serving a jail term for rustling, on his way back to his ranch and daughter Kate. He is stopped by some ranchers who were victims of the rustlers and, when he refuses to leave the territory, they attempt to summarily hang him. Sheriff Smoky Moore tries to stop it but is knocked out. Tom Cameron/The Lone Rider and Fuzzy Jones rescue Stewart and also see that Smoky is an old friend of theirs. Nora Mason, whose husband was hung for rustling the year before, is operating with her gang leader Trimmer Davis and his henchmen, from the Santa Clarissa Mission, where the three outlaws are posing as padres after imprisoning mission Padre JosE. Nora is staying at Stewart's ranch where, under an assumed name, she has made friends with Kate. Tom recognizes Nora, says nothing, but steals a token inscribed "To Nora from Bruce" from a necklace. The bandits run stolen cattle onto Stewart's ranch, kill him, and try to blame it on Tom. Smoky arrests him for his own protection, but later lets him escape to go after the rustlers. Nora's gang, posing as Padres, are rustling cattle. Tom Cameron suspects the Padres are fakes and to find out what the gang is up to next, he arrives at their mission posing as a Padre.
