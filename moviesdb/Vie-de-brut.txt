Vie de brut

 "To show how the people who consort with oil live, the way in which they work, of which they take advantage or of which they suffer from this natural blessing of their ground. Oil has its place in the financial pages of our newspapers, and seldom the people who live in the shade of the large machine to produce energy. When the journalist Serge Enderlin and the photograph Paolo Woods # whose trip is responsible for this film # had achieved their journey and brought back their work. It seemed obvious to me that their subject # oil # was at the center of the beam of preoccupations of today. Oil fascinates as much as it disgusts. Probably because behind it, numerous themes are outlined and this agitates our society Iraq, misery, fortune, ecology, pollution... The film enters upon these themes, putting the people who live near black gold on the foreground."
