This City Is a Body

 This City is a Body is part doco, part fiction, part other. Expect a raw film filled with many touching, untold, Australian stories - underscored by a quiet, yet palpable, tension. Expect an Australia you simply haven't seen before. Cross between the stories of fifty very different Sydneysiders and see what a city has to do to stand up.
