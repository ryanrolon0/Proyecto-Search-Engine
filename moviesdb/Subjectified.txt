Subjectified

 Filmmaker Melissa Tapper Goldman traveled around the US looking for real answers to the question "Why do women have sex?" Through nine in-depth personal interviews with young women, she followed her curiosity into the homes of religious and non-religious women, young moms, gay and straight women, friends and strangers. Goldman conducted the conversations alone, with no camera crew. In turn, the subjects opened up about their most personal experiences, tapping into stories that are too complex and too real to fit into a TV plot line, sometimes heartwarming and sometimes disturbing. From outrageous to awkward to uncontrollably funny, the interviews peer into the minds of young women in America trying their best to make sense of a complicated subject.
