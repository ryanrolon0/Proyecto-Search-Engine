Una Sabíduria Antigua

 This film follows an Aymara medicine man through a typical ritual as he explains and explores some of the ideals of the indigenous Bolivian culture. The indigenous culture is a much more interconnected, community based culture, which influences their views on humanity, the environment, and world conflict.
