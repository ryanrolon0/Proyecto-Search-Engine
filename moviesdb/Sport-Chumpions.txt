Sport Chumpions

 A series of unrelated sports gags. Archery we see where the archer is standing. Billiards move together. Ping pong A long, long chute and a very short jump. Track hurdles like ladders. Swimming mermaid. A men's champion demonstrates strokes, ending with the crawl (on the bottom of the pool, on all fours). We see dives, ending with a seedy bar. Crew mess. Bicycle track racing catcher gets knocked back by the ball. Football with every seat on the 50-yard line one row wide and hundreds tall. On field pileup huge tangle. Auto racing
