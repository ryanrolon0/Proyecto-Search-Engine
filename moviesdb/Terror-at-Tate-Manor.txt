Terror at Tate Manor

 Terror at Tate Manor is an independent horror film set in a real haunted house, rich in ghost and spirit sightings, and quite active throughout the filming. Built in 1926, the mansion resides on an Indian burial ground and was the site of countless hangings at the hands of North Georgia law enforcement, the KKK, and anyone else Col. Samuel Tate wanted out of the way. The movie features veteran horror heroines Leslie Culton and Jenny Wallace, and actors John Saenz and Jonathan Tabor. Candice is invited spend a weekend with her boyfriend in a deserted Victorian mansion. She drags along her best friend Marie, and Marie's boyfriend Sean and kid brother Scott.
