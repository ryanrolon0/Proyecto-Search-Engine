So Well Remembered

 On the day that World War II ends in Europe, Mayor George Boswell recalls events of the previous 25 years in his home town of Browdley. As councilman and newspaper editor George has fought hard to better working and living conditions in the bleak Lancashire mill town. As a young man he meets and marries Olivia Channing, whose father was jailed in a scandal involving the mill he owned. Olivia is ambitious and manages to guide George within striking distance of a seat in Parliament. But an outbreak of diphtheria changes George's outlook, and his and Olivia's lives change forever. In Browdley, a small English mill town, Olivia Channing is a candidate for the city librarian position, but her father, a former mill owner, was responsible for the grim conditions in which the poorer townspeople are living. George Boswell, editor of the town's newspaper, condemns the council's reluctance to appoint her, and she gets the job. Later, after her father is killed in a car crash, she and George are married. She has high ambitions for his future, and persuades him to stand for Parliament. An epidemic of diphtheria occurs and Bowsell assists the over-worked Dr. Whiteside, and withdraws his candidacy. After their son dies from diphtheria, Olivia leaves George. Boswell campaigns for better housing and becomes town Mayor. Years later, Dr. Whiteside's adopted daughter, Julie, is working as a hospital nurse. Charles Winslow, a young Air Force officer, and Olivia's son by her second marriage, and Julie fall in love. But after he is disfigured in a flying accident, he falls under the deterrent influence of his mother. But Boswell intervenes.
