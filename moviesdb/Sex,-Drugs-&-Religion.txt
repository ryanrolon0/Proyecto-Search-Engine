Sex, Drugs & Religion

 Sex, Drugs & Religion is the fourth film release from B.A. Brooks and is quickly causing quite a stir in religious communities across the globe, while also hailing acclaim as a very entertaining, and insightful film experience by some seemingly more open minded individuals. In any case, sometimes the truth is hard to accept but if you can not be honest with yourself then just maybe this is not the film for you, but if you are ready to take a comedic journey into the cosmos then sit back and fasten your seat belt.
