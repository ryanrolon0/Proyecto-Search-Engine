The Lady Red Trio

 'The Lady Red Trio' is a short with three parts - 'The Torch Song', 'Boogaloo', and 'Misery Takes A Holiday' - that explores the intimate relationships of three very different women and their husbands. Through the eyes of a wife approaching middle age, a girl approaching romantic burnout, and a mother approaching a breakdown, 'The Lady Red Trio' explores the meaning of love and stagnation in the early 21st century.
