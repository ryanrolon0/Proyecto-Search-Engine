The Elephant

 Inspired by true events from 1969. "The Elephant" is slang for an oil strike of at least 500 million barrels and while American and European oil companies had been searching in the North Sea for years, they kept missing the 'big one.' On board the oil rig 'Ocean Star,' the brutal differences between the US drilling crew and the Europeans explode as they fight against the wild elements of the North Sea. Unbeknown to them, this multi-national crew is about to write history.
