The Force on Thunder Mountain

 Thunder Mountain somewhere in the American wilderness, has a reputation that has scared away travellers, both white and Indian, for hundreds of years. Undaunted by the ghost stories surrounding the mountain, a father decides it's just the place for him and his son to go camping and do a little bonding. Strange voices and stranger footprints around their campground try to warn the pair away, but Dad is unconcerned and blithely pushes on. Eventually, however, the two come face to face with the force standing guard over this forbidden mountain.
