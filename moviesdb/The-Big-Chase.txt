The Big Chase

 Plot has Korean-War vet Grayson returning and joining the L.A. Police Academy, which we learn in a flashback told by Police Lt. Ned Daggert to story-hunting reporter Milton Graves We also learn that Pete's wife Doris is pregnant and concerned about her husband's safety.Meanwhile, in the state prison, inmates Brad Bellows and Jim Meggs are planning a big heist as soon as Brad gets out of prison. The caper they pull, and the resultant chase, all over Hollywood, Los Angelese and a large portion of Southern California, involving Grayson shows that his wife's concern was more than warranted. A GI comes home from the Korean War and joins the L.A. police department. His wife gets pregnant and worries about how safe he is out on the street, and with good reason--he soon gets involved in pursuing a gang of payroll robbers through the streets of Los Angeles.
