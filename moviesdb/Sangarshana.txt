Sangarshana

 Dilip (Chiranjeevi) returns from America to find his father Harnatha Rao indulging in illegal activities. The story is about Chiranjeevi doing the ethical thing and bringing his father to justice. A sideshow is Rao Gopala Rao (in a very good role) is a business of Harnatha Rao partner who is trying to quell a worker's uprising in his factory. Vijayasanthi is the sister of the Union leader. Gummadi is the father of both the union leader and vijayasanthi in his usual role. Chiranjeevi's dance moves are very fluid.
