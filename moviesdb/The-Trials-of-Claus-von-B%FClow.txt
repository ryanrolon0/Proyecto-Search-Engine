The Trials of Claus von Bülow

 Guilty or not guilty? You be the judge. Danish-born aristocrat Claus von Bulow made headlines in the mid-'80s, when he was accused of trying to murder his diabetic wife, Sunny von Bulow, by injecting her with a deadly dose of insulin. Prosecutors were convinced von Bulow wanted to murder his wealthy wife in order to inherit millions of dollars and marry his longtime mistress, Alexandra Isles, a former soap opera actress. In February 1982, von Bulow stood trial on national television for the attempted murder of his wife. The state's case rested on circumstantial evidence black bag filled with drugs; a maid's observations; and testimony from Sunny's two grieving children from her previous marriage. On March 16, 1982, von Bulow was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison. However, the businessman decided to fight back and hired high-powered Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz to appeal his case. Dershowitz found inconsistencies in the medical and scientific evidence presented in the first trial. Two years later, the Rhode Island State Supreme Court reversed von Bulow's conviction. Despite the higher court's decision, von Bulow's worries were far from over. In 1984, the Attorney General of Rhode Island decided to try the case one more time. Armed with new medical evidence, his attorneys persuaded jurors that von Bulow was a man wrongly accused. In May of 1985, von Bulow was found not guilty. Von Bulow's acquittal was not the end of his legal woes. His stepchildren sued for $56 million in a civil suit. Later, von Bulow agreed to divorce Sunny and never speak or write about the trials. Today, von Bulow lives a quiet life in London. Sunny died December 6, 2008.
