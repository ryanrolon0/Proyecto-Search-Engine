Shvedskite krale

 Dressed up like a 'Swedish king', a thick wad of bank notes in his pocket, the worker Spas has decided to have a holiday of his life at a fashionable seaside resort. It turns out, however, that he feels lonely and unhappy at the resort of his dreams and, before his holiday is over, he goes back to the construction site, to his friends and fellow-workers without having found what he has dreamt of. The worker fails to find his feet at the seaside resort among the white Mercedes cars and elegant women, though he is prepared to throw about a lot of money. The only thing he knows how to do well is work.
