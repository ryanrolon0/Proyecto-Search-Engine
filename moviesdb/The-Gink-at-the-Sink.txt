The Gink at the Sink

 Hugh is unable to produce a birth certificate in order to get a job, so he becomes a stay-home hubby (a man way ahead of his time) to take care of the house while his wife becomes Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner. Hugh decides to make an upside-down cake in his sideways style, brushes off a brush saleswoman who comes calling on the lady-of-the-house, and then has a disastrous encounter with a lady plumber. His wife has her work cut out for her after she gets home from work.
