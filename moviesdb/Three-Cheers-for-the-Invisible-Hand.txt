Three Cheers for the Invisible Hand

 Three Cheers for the Invisible Hand is based on the economic theory by the economist Adam Smith. In a free market capitalist society, the system will balance itself to benefit everyone, as if guided by "an invisible hand." People mistake the inertia of their lives for desire, let life just happen to them, but are ambivalent about the outcomes. Suburbia as a non-place history, no mythology. A glorified limbo that people seem to fall into.
