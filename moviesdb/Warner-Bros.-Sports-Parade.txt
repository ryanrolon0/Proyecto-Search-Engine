Warner Bros. Sports Parade

 This Sports Parade short's theme is participant-sports all across the USA or, at least, west of the Mississippi Rivers. Skiing in Aspen, Colorado (when it was still a real town) and amateur-rodeo in New Mexico. The came visits Abilene, Kansas, where greyhound-racing with the dogs chasing live rabbits is a pastime and then wanders over to Phoenix, Arizona for a look at hot-rodders racing their modified jalopies, before automobile companies and NASCAR took over the world.
