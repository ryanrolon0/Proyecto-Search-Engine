Waves at Dover, England

 The finest wave scene that we have ever offered to the public. It was taken during a recent storm, at the base of one of the huge piers at Dover. The effect is startling and realistic, as the huge billows work in from the ocean and dash with appalling force against the barricade of stone, sending spray hundreds of feet in the air.
