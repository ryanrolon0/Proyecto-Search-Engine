Time in Tempora

 This is my story of time spent with Skarekrau Radio, or as the local natives of Tempora, IL say 'Krau'. And who is Krau? One band member describes their sound like this like your grandmother dying...if she died in a violent way.' My initial interest was how they perform chaotic rituals on stage. Shortly after their lead singer (Kricket Greene) disappeared, I realized I was obsessed with her. For five years I continued to document the band in hopes of finding what truly happened to Kricket.
