The Misanthrope

 Artemis is a bum. As a failed actor, low-quality school teacher and disappointed lover, he is looking for a direction in life. When he fails to be cast in a local production of the Misanthrope, and the beloved school theater director passes away, he sees hope in an idea. And so Artemis sets out to direct a group of essentially talentless inner-city grade-school kids in Moliere's The Misanthrope. Though the road is rocky at first, Artemis, with the help of the School Principal, begins to pull his play, and his life, back together again.
