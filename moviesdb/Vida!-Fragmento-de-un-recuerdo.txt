Vida! Fragmento de un recuerdo

 Any given night when Marilu closes her eyes the tormenting memories of torture and rape will be back. The Pinochet regime in Chile forced her to go into exile, now she desperately tries to start a new life in germany, but the nightmares catch up inexorable. She seeks for help and meets with Gonzalo, who has experienced similar treatment. During long and intense visits he guides her back into the basements where all the tortures have happened. Eventually she sees that noone can help to get rid of the past but herself to have a new, a second life after all.
