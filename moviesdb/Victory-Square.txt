Victory Square

 This is the contemporary story of Tania and Nastia - a close-knit mother and daughter in Minsk, Belarus, whose relationship begins to suffer when each becomes romantically attached to a man the other despises. The daughter's unfolding love affair and the mother's painful relationship to her ex-husband are two narratives which lead to their current troubles, misunderstandings, and their constant parent/child role switching. Rejecting her mothers warnings, Nastia gets deeper involved with Slava, a married man with mysterious and illicit money-making practices. In response Tania returns to Igor, a high-art, out-of-work actor and poet, for whom Nastia has harbored a deep resentment since childhood. The family feud culminates in the days preceding Nastia's wedding when Igor confronts the bride, forcing Tania to chose between him and her daughter.
