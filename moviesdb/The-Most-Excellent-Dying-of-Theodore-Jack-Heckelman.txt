The Most Excellent Dying of Theodore Jack Heckelman

 'The Most Excellent Dying of Theodore Jack Heckelman' A Full length documentary of courageous and conscious dying, community and hope.... A heart warming full length documentary of the courageous dying of a man determined to die consciously and in so doing gave manifold blessings to everyone around him. He resolved to live his brief time left on earth to the fullest, and he called it 'my last great adventure.' Rare and touching footage of his community and family support--of his contracting for his casket to be made by a beloved niece and receiving it just before his death-- of friends gathering to tell him farewell and singing for him in the last hours, and then caring for him at home and honoring him with a three day vigil. A warm, natural, open, and accepting mood around the threshold of death is apparent throughout the film. And needless to say, when family takes over, great expenses are not incurred for funerals and undertaking! It was Jack's wish this film of the last chapter in life's journey be his legacy of hope and encouragement for many and empower them with choices for their own dying they may not have known they have.
