The Boston Strangler

 Boston, Mass. 1962. The dawn of the serial killer was at hand. Thirteen innocent women were brutally slaughtered by a faceless monster. Now, through the eyes of the killer himself, we are taken on a sadistic journey from the jail cell to the grave, reliving each terrifying event one murder at a time. Mauro Lannini, as Albert DeSalvo, gives a frighteningly real performance that has you guessing his innocence or guilt until the very end.
