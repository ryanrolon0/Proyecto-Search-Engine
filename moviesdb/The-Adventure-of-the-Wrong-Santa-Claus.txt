The Adventure of the Wrong Santa Claus

 The amateur detective Octavius is asked to play 'Santa Claus' at the home of his friends, the Randall family. He picks up a costume and goes to visit them. Although Mrs. Randall already has a 'Santa Claus' costume available, Octavius decides to wear his own. But a burglar sneaks into the house, puts on the other costume, knocks out Octavius, and robs the family. When Octavius comes to, he is determined to catch the criminal.
