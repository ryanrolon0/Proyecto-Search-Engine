The Compassion Generation

 In 2005, on September 12 the Dalai Lama visited Idaho, and gave a blessing to over 7,000 children from around the state. This Documentary chronicles his meeting with 16 children chosen from their essays and nominations about their expression of love, compassion, and gratitude. The day before he gave a special blessing to the 9/11 and Katrina victims. This message of compassion, love, and healing is shared throughout the community in this humanitarian film; THE COMPASSION GENERATION.
