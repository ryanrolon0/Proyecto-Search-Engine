Sketch!

 Includes over a thousand different images selected from tens of thousands of drawings, sketches, and art works all from one artist, Dick Ford. The images span from student work to that of a professional visual artist. There are academic studies from the old masters of western and eastern art traditions, figure drawing studies, rapidly executed sketches of passersby in public spaces, and detailed portraits of close friends and family. Styles range from photographic realism, through gestural inventions, to abstractions of pure form. The film presents a flowing sequence of images leading from one sketch book to another, edited to original music created by the artist in collaboration with his brother, Dennis Ford. The rich variety of imagery offers the viewer many surprises along the way as visual ideas generate and develop, change, merge with one another, and evolve into new expressions.
