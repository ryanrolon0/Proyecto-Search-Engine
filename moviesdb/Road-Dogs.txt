Road Dogs

 Join BeanBag, the world's most uptight cameraman, as he follows three comedians on the road as they tour some of the smallest comedy venues on planet Earth, all with one goal the camera, patrons who tear their clothes off, and gallons of liquor, chaos reigns. There's even a guest appearance by Comedy Central's Dave Attell. So, basically, it's another typical day in the Midwest.
