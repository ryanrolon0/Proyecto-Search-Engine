The Gospel According to the Blues

 A widow in her sixties, Momma-Lou is a pillar of her community and her church, where she sings gospel in the choir on Sundays, lifting her joyous voice to the Lord. But each day, she must watch the neighbourhood around her slipping deeper into poverty and despair. Momma-Lou's son Gideon has the blues, too. A college graduate, he struggles without success to find a job that will provide properly for his wife Cherlene and their two young children. Frustrated and angry, he turns to the one line of work that seems to promise an easy path out of poverty. The knowledge that her son profits from the very drug trade that has ripped the community apart is more than Momma-Lou can bear. When Gideon's criminal activities endanger her grandchildren, she faces a terrible choice. What price is Momma-Lou willing to pay to remove Gideon and his drugs from her life - for good?
