Stud Life

 JJ is a lesbian, and Seb, a gay man, is her best friend - they work together and play together. When JJ falls for Elle and Seb falls for Smack Jack, the pair have to split their attention and allocate time for one another. But what about friendship? Mates b4 muff? What would you do? Stud Life is something a little bit different from the norm. See it. Think about it. You decide.
