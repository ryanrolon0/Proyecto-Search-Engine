The Rats

 In Manhattan, when a client is bitten by a rat in the dressing room of the Garsons Department Store and contracts Weil's disease, the manager Susan Costello is assigned to hire and give all the necessary support to the best exterminator in New York, Jack Carver. The efficient Jack and his assistant Ty find a colony of mutant rats and try to convince the health department administrator and former partner of Jack, Ray Jarrett, how serious the infestation is. But the politician Ray is interested in covering the problem to protect economical interests of powerful groups. Susan is head of public relations at Garvers department store NYC. Trouble begins when a customer is bitten in one of the dressing rooms and develops Wheelers disease. More incidents occur, more people end up in hospital. A discrete but professional rat exterminator is brought into to inspect the store, but the rats have far greater goals than just Garvers, they are taking over the subway, recreational centers, apartment buildings, buses. A woman in an upscale department store gets bitten by a rat. Unfortunately this isn't an ordinary rat and he is not alone. The rats invade the department store and a rec center and that is just the beginning. Soon people across midtown are checking into the hospital with the rare Weil's disease, a disease carried by rats. The health department is too busy covering up the situation to see how widespead and dangerous the infestation really is. Solving the rat problem thus falls to Susan Costello the department store manager, and Jack Carver the suave and discrete exterminator.
