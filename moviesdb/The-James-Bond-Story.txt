The James Bond Story

 Bond, James Bond. Perhaps the greatest fictional cinema icon ever. He first appeared on the big screen in 1962 in Dr. No, and has remained the most powerful action hero ever since. The secret to his success is his adaptability. No matter what tight spot he finds himself, he always appears to be suave, sophisticated and cool. As a spy Bond is constantly reinventing himself, and on the big screen he has done this five times, as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. The documentary looks at the different characterizations each actor has brought to the role to discover the elements that make up Bond. It also traces the character back to its origin, the Bond novels by Ian Fleming, whose creation was semi-autobiographical. From the gadgets to the girls, The James Bond Story also features interviews with Q (the late Desmond Llewelyn), Maud Adams, Jane Seymour, Terence Young (Director), Cubby Broccoli (Producer), Ian Fleming and more, along with extensive film clips from Dr. No to The World is Not Enough. This action-packed documentary presents an in-depth look at the quintessential spy who has a license to kill.
