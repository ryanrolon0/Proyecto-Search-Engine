The Breastford Wives

 Young married couple Rob and Laura move to the peaceful, friendly town of Breastford and right away are made to feel at home by the welcoming members of the Breastford Womens Association. Rob almost immediately has sex with these three lovelies (as does Laura), but they soon realize that something is amiss, and they discover the reason invented a device that, at the push of a button, turns women into insatiable, sex-crazed robots.
