Twilight Highway

 Two women - the one prudish and inhibited, bored and bad-tempered the other - on their trip to somewhere stop at a motel, owned by a charming, old piano player who convinced the girls to stay for the night. Two men from Ohio on their way to "Time Square" stop at the same motel because their car broke down. The four are the only guests in the motel. With subtle tricks, the motel owner forces his guests to stay longer than they wanted. The atmosphere becomes more and more intimate, they get closer.
