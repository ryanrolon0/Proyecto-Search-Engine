The Misadventures of Holly Harmony

 Harmony Concepts' mascot, Holly Harmony, comes to life in the person of blonde bombshell Stacy Burke. And like the Harmony cartoon character, the buxom beauty is soon placed in peril by a burglar who will stop at nothing to steal a project in the possession of Holly's boss, which means that the poor secretary will be placed in tight bondage until the ransom is paid.
