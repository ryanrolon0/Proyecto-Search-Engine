Sis Hopkins

 A young girl from the "sticks" comes to the city to live with her wealthy relatives. At first she is the objection of derision and made fun of because of her unsophisticated nature, but it turns out that there's a bit more to her than most of her snooty relatives and their condescending friends think.
