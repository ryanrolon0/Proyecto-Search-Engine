Tsur's Kids

 Six men and one mother provide a portrait of present day Israel and an introspective into the consequences of being a paratrooper in the world's most famous army, The Israeli Defense Forces. The film juxtaposes life and death, past and present, celebrating life and hoping for a better future.
