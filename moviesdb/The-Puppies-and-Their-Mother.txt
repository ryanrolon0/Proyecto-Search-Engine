The Puppies and Their Mother

 This interesting picture from life illustrates the principle of self preservation as exhibited in the lower animals. A group of young dogs partaking of their noonday meal afford us an opportunity of observing the persistency with which these young animals attack the fountain of life, and the various tactics they employ to secure the best point of vantage to obtain that which satisfies their appetite, which at present seems to be their sole object in life. A humorous and instructive lesson in Nature.
