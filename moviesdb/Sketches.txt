Sketches

 In a fantasy life she lives through her sketchbook, Laura's world is exotic, bright and enchanting. In reality, she endures the day-to-day hurt of a sensitive girl who is very much alone. Her world changes when she meets Courtenay, a compulsive liar who brags about the suicide note in her back pocket. As the girls begin to bond, Laura gradually begins to find herself abandoning the safety of the fantasy and falling into her first real friendship.
