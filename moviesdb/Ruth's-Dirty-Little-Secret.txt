Ruth's Dirty Little Secret

 This Dark Comedy is an uncomfortable look at a very repressed woman who only wants to please her ogre of a husband. Ruth second-guesses her every little move under his oppressive watch and finds no comfort in her father's phone calls, but she has a way out. Ruth has a secret, a dirty little secret.
