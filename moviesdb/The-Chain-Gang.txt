The Chain Gang

 Mickey Mouse and several other characters are on a prison chain gang, guarded by Pegleg Pete. They break rocks for a while, then Mickey breaks out a harmonica and everyone starts making music and/or dancing. Soon there's a jail-break, and Mickey's on the run, tracked by bloodhounds (including his future pet, Pluto, in his first appearance). He falls off a cliff and right into a jail cell. Mickey Mouse maintains his cheerful disposition as a prisoner on a chain gang. He and his fellow inmates even liven up the prison yard by using the rocks and their rock-breaking tools as musical instruments. Chaos erupts during a prison break, as guards shoot bullets in every direction, even at each others' rear ends. Mickey manages to escape, and finds two cart horses to help him gallop ahead of the bloodhounds. Unfortunately, the cart horses are difficult to control, and they take him where he least expects to end up.
