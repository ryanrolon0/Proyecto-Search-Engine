San Quinn

 The most popular rapper in San Francisco, San Quinn, brings us into his life as he goes on tours, raises his son on the road, and battles addiction all while trying to remain an upstanding family man. He shows the world a different side of hip-hop as he brings the audience behind the scenes with him and teaches us that rappers are not just the one dimensional caricatures we are used to seeing on TV.
