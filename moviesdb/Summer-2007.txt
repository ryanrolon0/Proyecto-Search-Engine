Summer 2007

 Believing in 'beginner's luck', Rahul Sharma, encouraged by three other fellow-medical students of Mumbai's Kasturba Medical College (Qateel, Shomindu, and Priyanka) decides to become the Students' President, opposing Prakash Dubey. When mainstream political goons get involved, resulting in intimidation and violence, he and his motley crew, along with Vishaka, decide to get involved in the Rural Medical Scheme for a month. Hoping to be stationed near Goa, enjoy and have some fun, they instead find themselves in a remote and impoverished, plagued with frequent suicides by entire families, Vidarbha village; their lives controlled and endangered by Dr. Mukesh Jadhav, and the goons of Wagh respectively. Faced with lack of transportation, virtually nowhere to run, they may never survive to return back home.
