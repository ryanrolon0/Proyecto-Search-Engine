Superhero Talent

 "Superhero Talent" is an intelligent dark comedy that pits talent against love. Cutro, a high-powered business executive, argues that the talented do not need love like the untalented. Page, his fawning co-worker, disagrees. As they heatedly debate status, women, and the reality of becoming a superhero, deeper, more personal meanings are revealed. The film is shot in a single moving master.
