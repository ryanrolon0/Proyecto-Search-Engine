Utsushimi

 While butoh master Akaji Maro is in rehearsal and fashion designer Shinichiro Arakawa preparing for the Paris collection, filmmaker Sion Sono begins a movie about a high school girl who falls in love... with a restaurant cook she's never even talked to. Soon the artists' works come together in a race to help the girl's love.
