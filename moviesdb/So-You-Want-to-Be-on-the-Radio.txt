So You Want to Be on the Radio

 Joe McDoakes sits in his living room in Hollywood, listening to the radio. He switches stations rapidly and gets a comic montage. He calls a station to answer a question correctly, so he and his wife Alice get tickets to the radio show, "Aren't People Ridiculous?" Joe and Alice are contestants - Alice answers poorly, Joe looks ridiculous, but they win some prizes, including tickets to "Double Up or Drop Dead." Joe's a contestant on that show too. Then back at home, another radio show draws his name from a hat; he races to the studio, arriving in time for yet another set of questions. Prizes again? Joe McDoakes, who is trying to find something interesting to listen to on the radio, finally settles on a name that tune quiz to win two tickets to the show, "Aren't People Ridiculous". Knowing the song, he calls in and wins the tickets for he and his wife, Alice, to appear on the show. They are willing to do anything ridiculous to win all the prizes. Despite their less than stellar performance on that show, they decide to take their winnings and the two free tickets to appear on another program, "Double Up or Drop Dead". Joe's appearance on that show takes a premeditated turn once the show host learns something important about Joe. Then finally, Joe and Alice are listening to the "Sneezing Man" program, where the lucky home listener telephoned has to guess correctly the identity of the mystery sneezing man. Joe does whatever he needs to to be called and win the prizes for that contest. His efforts may prove to be disastrous for all involved.
