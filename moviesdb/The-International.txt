The International

 It's 1956, and Bill Tupper makes a decision that bitterly disappoints his fiancEe. But before he can make amends, he is supernaturally transported into the year 2008. There, he meets Nathan Doyle, a directionless loser who understands what it means to be a letdown in the eyes of the one you love.
