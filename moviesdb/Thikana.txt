Thikana

 Unemployed, alcoholic slacker lawyer Ravi Goel's life has no meaning and direction until his to-be brother-in-law, Police Inspector Ranbir Singh, offers his frank advise, and instructs him to improve himself so that he and his (Ravi's) sister, Shashi, can finally get married. Ravi gives up drinking, and starts practicing law. He meets with a dancer named Shaila and both fall in love. He finds out that Shaila's brother, Avinash, is missing, and assists her in finding him. He does find him or rather his ashes in a crematorium. This news devastates Shaila, and Ravi takes it upon himself to find the killer. The clue apparently lies in Avinash's swimming pool locker, a video-tape that will throw new light on Ravi, his family, and the killers - who are not only known to Ravi, but also hold powerful and influential positions in the city. Ravi knows that his next step could make him better or he could regress back into being an alcoholic again.
