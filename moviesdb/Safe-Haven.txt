Safe Haven

 In the opening days of World War II, the Nazis occupy Warsaw. In a display of extraordinary courage and commitment, Zookeeper Jan Zabinski decides to hide the city's most endangered residents in his home. Before war's end, the Warsaw Zoo will become a safe haven for 300 Jewish men, women, and children.
