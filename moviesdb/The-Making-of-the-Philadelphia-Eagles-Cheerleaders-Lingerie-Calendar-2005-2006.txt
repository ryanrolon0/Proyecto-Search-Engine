The Making of the Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleaders Lingerie Calendar 2005-2006

 The Philadelphia Eagles hold auditions for their cheerleading squad for 2005, and six hundred women try out. After a series of auditions in which they are judged on physical fitness and beauty, dance, and speaking ability, 38 women are selected for the squad. The selectees go to Florida to be photographed for the squad's annual lingerie calendar. The women are seen posing for the photographer, and they describe their experiences working on the calendar. Between photography sessions, the cheerleaders go to the beach to compete against the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders in beach volleyball, relay races, and tug of war.
