Watermelon Honey

 When Chris comes back from seminary for the first time in a year, he expects the comfortable assurances of home, and a warm reception from his fiancEe Lynette. But Lynette has spent the year as a missionary in the third world, and has returned home harder and colder than she was before. Her father and his mother, the owners of neighboring farms, expect them to be married - the same kind of perfect marriage found between their watermelon flowers and bees, producing every summer delicious Watermelon Honey. But Chris and Lynette must confront their own changed perspectives on the world to discover whether they love they felt was destined, or a convenience destined to end.
