Uncommon Vision

 Documentary about John Howard Griffin, a white man who disguised himself as a black man (dying his skin) and traveled through the South during the Civil Rights era. He did so because he was writing a news article about discrimination against blacks in the South. He wrote a famous book called "Black Like Me," describing his adventures.
