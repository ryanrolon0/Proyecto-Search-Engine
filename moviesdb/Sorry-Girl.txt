Sorry Girl

 How often in a day do you say sorry? How often do you mean it? Can you imagine what it would be like to live life without apologies? SORRY GIRL introduces us to film director, Melody Marchand, who like most Canadians, says sorry for just about everything. Melody has taken saying sorry to a whole new level, where even inanimate objects are apologized to. When we meet her, Melody is overshadowed at work and a cause of ever growing frustration to her long suffering boyfriend, Aaron. Melody knows if she could just ask for what she wants without apology, she could achieve her dreams of fame and fortune in the notoriously hard-nosed film industry. As the story unfolds, Aaron hits on a shocking solution to cure Melody of her sorry habit. Aaron doesn't anticipate the quick results or the nasty side effects of his cure. After all, what do you do with a woman who is hell bent on never saying sorry again?
