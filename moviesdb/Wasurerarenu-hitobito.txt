 The story of 3 Men who served together in the Japanese Imperial Army during WWII. The story is told in flashbacks from modern day Japan to scenes on the island they are defending. In modern Japan, one of the men falls in love with a woman who is being deceived and victimized by a cult to get her money. After her suicide, he takes drastic action that forces his comrades in arms to avenge his death against the cult's headquarters. A fine subplot with a young neighbor boy helps drive home the point of the deep scars still carried by survivors of the war.
