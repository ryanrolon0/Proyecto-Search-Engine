The Haunted Cat

 Following one of their usual violent fights, the cat thinks he has killed Little Roquefort, and buries him, with a lot of sadness, in a flower pot. The mouse is not dead, of course, and he returns to frighten the cat, and does so to the point he thinks the cat has died. He hasn't and when the cat makes a comeback, they are both scared of each other.
