Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma

 Set in the Nazi-controlled, northern Italian state of Salo in 1944, four dignitaries round up sixteen perfect specimens of youth and take them together with guards, servants and studs to a palace near Marzabotto. In addition, there are four middle-aged women stories whilst the fourth accompanies on the piano. The story is largely taken up with their recounting the stories of Dante and De Sade of Manias, the Circle of Shit and the Circle of Blood. Following this, the youths are executed whilst each libertine takes his turn as voyeur.
