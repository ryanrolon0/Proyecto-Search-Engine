The Groom

 1942. How would a wealthy Nazi spy in America feel if the morning after his wedding he finds his American wife dead in their bathtub with her wrists and neck slashed after having committed suicide? How would this man feel if his wife had committed suicide out of remorse because she delivered the incriminating evidence to the government that would send him to jail? How would he feel if he wasn't really a spy but he made her believe he was just so she would give him the time of day?! What if she was also hiding something - something awful?
