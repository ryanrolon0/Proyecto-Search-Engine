 Nick's made poor choices professionally and personally. A man feared and envied by many, he's lived a life seduced by crime, money, beautiful women, and burlesque. Now he wants out and he's got 24 hours to find an exit. He's helped by the love of his life, ex-burlesque dancer, Regan Price and by his brother Tony, owner of The Uptown Bar.
