The Imperiled Princess

 A buxom, raven-haired princess falls in love with an American soldier and determines to return to the United States when the G.I.'s tour is up. She leaves her startled bodyguards bound and gagged and flies to America, pursued by an enemy agent with a nefarious scheme. The agent captures a State Department official and assumes her identity, then proceeds with her plan to kidnap the princess. Unfortunately for the comely agent and her captive victim, there are more powerful villains lurking about who would love to spirit too lovely ladies away for parts unknown.
