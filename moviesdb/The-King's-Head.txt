The King's Head

 Despite a severely limited budget and lack of government funding, The King's Head Theatre of London, founded by Dan Crawford, has been responsible for launching many famous names within the British entertainment industry. Over sixty contributors talk about their experiences at the King's Head Theatre. The documentary also follows Crawford as he casts, rehearses and mounts a production of Michael Wall's 'Women Laughing' just months before his untimely death.
