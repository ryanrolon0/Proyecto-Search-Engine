Streets of Wonderland

 Niagara Falls has forever been masked behind the neon lights and the thunderous water of dreams and fantasy. "Streets of Wonderland" strips away those facades and shows the city in a truthful light. Not everyone is winning big at the Casino, and not everyone is profiting off of the millions of tourists that flock to that city. Not everyone is on their honeymoon. Devlin Tully is a young man who only knows one way of life in this city; the life of survival. Everyone comes to this city to escape their problems, but where is he to go when his problems lie in the very city that people go to forget theirs. Devlin has blamed everyone for his current way of life; the city, the tourists, his Mother, his Father, and his friends. He soon realizes that the hatred that has built up inside him is only because of one person. Devlin Tully. How do you deal with the fact that you are actually the bad guy? That you're the one that has ruined your own life, and countless others? How do you deal with the fact that it is because of you that a lot of others are worse off for having known you? How do you live with yourself when you realize the person you hate the most is staring right back at you in the mirror?
