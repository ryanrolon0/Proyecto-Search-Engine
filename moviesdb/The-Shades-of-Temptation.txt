The Shades of Temptation

 The word "temptation" carries the idea of luring one into sin, but in the real life, the perception of temptation varies from one individual to another! The film, "The Shades of Temptation", portrays three different stories of individuals in the city of London and captures a glimpse of their lives at a stage when faced with a temptation and their reactions to it. Temptation takes the form of any object or a person or even an unreal desire. Hence, a basic necessity can be a temptation when one can't attain it. It can also be a decision, solely self centered or totally selfless.
