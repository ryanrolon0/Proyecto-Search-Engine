Toy Mountain Christmas Special

 From 2002 to 2010, Rocky's Kidz has collected a total of 12,019 toys to be given to less fortunate kids as part of the Toy Mountain Campaign. Each year on December 25th, 100's of 1000's of kids are not fortunate enough to experience the joy of this magical time of the year. Kids from all walks of life and all backgrounds should be given the opportunity to smile with happiness. It does not matter what your background is or even what religion you are, giving a gift to a less fortunate kid will bring happiness to that child and will make you feel good inside at the same time. Together we can make a difference! Remember, children are children no matter where in the world they live. This year Rocky Stone and everyone at Rocky's Kidz are looking for support from all over the world! Even if you are only able to send one toy via mail, that one toy will put a BIG smile on a little kids face! Please open up your hearts and show that you care.
