The Art of Seeing

 Ernst Haas hosts this four-part documentary series on the art of dye transfer photographs, later displayed by Kodak in a 1966 touring exhibition titled "The Art of Seeing." Some of the photographs were included in Haas' book "The Creation" (1971), also published as a 1976 trade paperback by Penguin.
