The Bundle

 Scary things come in small packages in Phillip Christon's comic thriller. A terrified prisoner is trapped in a dank dungeon when a small bundle is placed in her cell. To her horror, the bundle begins to slither its way closer and closer to her as the candlelight in the cell grows dimmer. The terror reaches a fever pitch when she dares to see what lurks inside The Bundle.
