This Little Ship

 This documentary short eulogizes the River-class frigate HMS Plym, a World War II British warship mothballed after the war. Britain chose this vessel to be the platform for its first atomic bomb test, in the Monte Bello Islands off the western coast of Australia. Although Plym did not see much action during the war, it made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of national defense.
