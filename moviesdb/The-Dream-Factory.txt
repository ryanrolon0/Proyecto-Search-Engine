The Dream Factory

 The Dream Factory chronicles a day in the life of independent studio owner, Tim Rivers. Tim's wife Jackie is pregnant with their first child, due at any minute. Tim struggles to juggle the egos of Nicky (a legend in his own mind), his indie band mates, Don the clueless producer, and Jake the harried manager/promoter, all the while fielding obnoxious phone calls from prospective clients looking for any deal they can con out of him. A dysfunctional time is guaranteed for all. Today is one of those days when Tim will question why he ever got into this business in the first place.
