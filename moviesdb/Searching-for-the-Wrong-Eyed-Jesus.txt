Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus

 Searching for The Wrong-Eyed Jesus is a captivating and compelling road trip through the creative spirit of the the South of the USA. Director Andrew Douglas's film follows "Alt Country" singer Jim White through a gritty terrain of churches, prisons, truck stops, biker bars and coal mines. This journey takes you through a very real contemporary Southern America, a world of marginalised white people and their unique and home-made culture. Along the way are roadside encounters with present-day musical mavericks including The Handsome Family, Johnny Dowd, 16 Horsepower and David Johansen; oldtime banjo player Lee sexton; rockabilly and mountain Gospel churches - and novelist Harry Crews telling grisly stories down a dirt track.
