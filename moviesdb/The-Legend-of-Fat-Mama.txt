The Legend of Fat Mama

 The sad-happy story of the Chinese community in Calcutta, India, and its migration to Toronto, Canada, after the Indo-China war in 1962. Through the search for a woman who once made the most delicious noodles in Calcutta's melting 'wok', discover great street food, a 'hand-written' newspaper, buzzing mahjong parlours, and the first all-woman dragon dance group. Experience too, the pain and hurt at the treatment the Chinese received (like Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbour) after the Indo-China war, even as they celebrate the Chinese New Year in the spirit of generosity and forgiveness.
