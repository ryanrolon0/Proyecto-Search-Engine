The Necromimesis

 Influenced by the work of Federico Fellini and works such as Myth of Sisyphus, The Necromimesis explores 'the absurd' ( Albert Camus ) through the eyes of Frederic ( David Knight ) On this particular day he has decided to end his life in order to spare himself from the monotonous cycle of existence. On his final journey through his home town, Frederic meets up with Pluto ( Drew Roulette ) an interested spectator here to collect his soul. The two venture through places that Frederic deems sentimental. All the while the two discuss the notion of alienation and ultimately the reasoning why today is a good day to take one's life. Shot entirely with ADR to give the film a dreamlike quality.
