Squatter

 Amongst the back alleys, abandoned buildings, and freight trains on the dark side of the city, Horus is on the run. With no parents, no home, and no direction, he rides the rails with the charismatic and anarchistic Dutch Boy and is introduced to a seductive new world. On the road together, Horus becomes disillusioned by the chaos and contradictions of his new mentor. On his own now more than ever, he continues forward still hoping to find a world that makes sense.
