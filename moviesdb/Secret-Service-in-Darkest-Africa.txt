Secret Service in Darkest Africa

 American secret service agent Rex Bennett (Rod Cameron) is assigned to defeat the plans of the Nazis to form an alliance in Africa with the Arabs. His aides are Janet Blake (Joan Marsh), a United Nations agent posing as a reporter, and Pierre LaSalle (Duncan Renaldo), a Free-French officer. Complications arise when a trusted Arab chieftain (Lionel Royce) turns out to be Baron vom Rommier, a German officer.
