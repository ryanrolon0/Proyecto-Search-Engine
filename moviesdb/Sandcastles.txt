Sandcastles

 Traveling from morning to night, "Sandcastles" chronicles a day in the life of a construction worker named Getz. Getz wakes up alongside a highway. His wallet and cell-phone are missing. With no recollection of the previous night, he returns home. On his answering machine he finds a message from himself...to himself devoted his entire, lonely life to his work and has, for years, worked seven-day weeks, this is a first. And with his routine disrupted, Getz can't help but puzzle over the riddle of his self-excused absence. All he knows is that it has something to do with Karina, whom he met at a bookstore months earlier, and Virgil, whom he's never heard of, but whose name now appears on his cell-phone's greeting.
