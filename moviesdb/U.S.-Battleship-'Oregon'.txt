U.S. Battleship 'Oregon'

 "This picture of the pride of the United States Navy was made on the occasion of the Peace Jubilee in New York City, and was taken from a tug passing the warship on its way up the North River. The entire crew are on deck, and a beautiful view of this wonderful craft is afforded."
