VEronique et son cancre

 A careless mother hires a young tutor to bring up her son's marks, as bad in mathematics as in French language. The young woman tries to teach the boy the easiest things in the curriculum, as well as some manners. She fails, faced with a puzzling logic in the boys' answers, and her tight new shoes. Alone at last, the boy picks up his rubber ball - to sleep on it.
