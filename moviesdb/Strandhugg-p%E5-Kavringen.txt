Strandhugg på Kavringen

 Silas - like many men - is his wife's husband. After one of their fights where Silas as usual draws the short straw, his wife sends him out to buy some fish. For the money she has given him and some money he has put aside himself, Silas decides to go on a drinking bender. But he dares not return home without fish, and therefore decides to combine the business of fishing with the pleasure of drinking, and borrows a small boat with some fishing tackle in it for this end. Then he sets out on the Oslo-fjord. Silas has no luck fishing, but succeeds admirably in getting drunk, finally falling asleep. He then dreams the main storyline of the movie comes to the small island of Kavreingen - one of the many small islands in the Oslo-fjord. Treasure-hunters, a blood thirsty pirate and an unknown beauty cross his path, but Silas defeats all obstacles except one wife suddenly shows up on the island. The unknown beauty, with whom Silas has fallen in love, disappears without a trace, and Silas's wife solves that mystery with some striking arguments.
