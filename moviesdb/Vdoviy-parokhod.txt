Vdoviy parokhod

 In a typical communal flat [so called soviet kommunalka] live four women. Each has her independent destiny nevertheless they are united by a common misery - their womanhood in the prewar USSR. The "Widow's Steamship" is this communal flat and it is also a metaphor of the entire soviet society - this laboratory of misery. It is amazing how, despite of all this depravity, the women survive and find their way to glimpses of joy.
