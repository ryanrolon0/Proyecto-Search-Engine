The 10 Minute Run!!!

 A shy boy in a high school physical education class has to run around a track for ten minutes. At first the boy does not want to run because he does not believe he can do it. Other students in his class make fun of him for being such a "loser", but after a girl smiles and talks to him, he gains the confidence he need to perform the 10 Minute Run.
