The Sims 2

 The sequel to one of the most successful PC games of all-time _The Sims (2000) (VG)_ (qv). In The Sims 2, players have a wide range of new options, socials, objects and lots more. The game is more realistic than the first as in The Sims 2 you can experience different life stages and even own a car (Nightlife expansion pack). As well as having babies (and twins), inheriting family genes, going to uni (University expansion pack), creating towns, having a more close-up experience, having wants and fears and creating extreme mansions - there are hundreds more things to do.
