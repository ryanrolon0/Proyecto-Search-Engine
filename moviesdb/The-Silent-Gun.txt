The Silent Gun

 A sheriff with a reputation as a fast gun almost kills an innocent child. He makes up his mind that he is not going to carry around loaded weapons anymore, but, since he's the sheriff of a lawless town, he compromises by carrying an unloaded pistol and relying on his reputation to keep order.
