Quiet

 In the heart of a sanitized suburban neighborhood, Herbert's everyday life is filled with constant emasculation at the hands of his wife, Eleanor, and the daily grind of work on the chain. He also tries to cope with the recent death of his 6 year old son Jacob, whose presence can still be felt in the house. For escape he paints the visions that haunt him, while Eleanor sends all of his hard earned money to a seedy tele-evangelist. Told as if reading the pages of a diary, along with a stunning visual style, Quiet illustrates that beyond the brink of madness lies one man's sanity.
