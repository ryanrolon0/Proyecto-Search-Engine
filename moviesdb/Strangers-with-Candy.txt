Strangers with Candy

 This parody of an after school special would prompt Comedy Central to commission the television series "Strangers with Candy." Fourty-seven year old Jerri Blank has just returned home for the first time in thirty-two years after running away to support her drug habit by becoming a prostitute. Now set on turning her life around, she goes back to high school and becomes a candy striper. But on the third day of school, the faculty demands that she help them get a girl expelled because of her suspected mental retardation.
