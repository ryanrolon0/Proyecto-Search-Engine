Someplace Better Than Here

 Inspired by events in her own life, Tiffany Barrett tells the story of Lucy Brawley, a young woman lost in the world of modern Christianity. On the day before her wedding, afraid that her sexuality, independence, dreams and thoughts may very well lead her to hell, Lucy struggles to quiet the voices in her head that continually ask her if there might be someplace better.
