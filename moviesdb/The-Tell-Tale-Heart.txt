The Tell-Tale Heart

 Based on the short story by Edgar Allan Poe and the American Civil War stories of Ambrose Bierce, THE TELL-TALE HEART is set in the final days of the American Civil War and the time of Abraham Lincoln's assassination, THE TELL-TALE HEART tells the tale of Captain Winter (Mark Redfield), an Army officer obsessed with hunting down and capturing a mad killer who tortured and murdered his comrades during the conflict. The trail to catch the murderer leads to a boarding house on the outskirts of war-torn Richmond, Virginia, run by Mr. and Mrs. Clarion, played by Robert Quarry and Ingrid Pitt. There, Winter discovers that the madman is masquerading as the old couple's son and turning the boarding house into a den of horror.
