Time Expired

 When locksmith Bobby gets out of prison after a two year sentence for stealing money from parking meters, his wife Ginny is waiting outside for him. So is Ruby, a transvestite who was Bobby's cell mate and became his lover in prison. Bobby spurns Ruby, but he finds himself unable to reconnect with Ginny once they're back home together. He's in love, and it's not with her. Is there any way he can sort this out?
