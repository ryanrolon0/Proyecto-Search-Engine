The Adorable Deceiver

 Nicholas, the king of a small Balkan state, Santa Maria, is forced to flee a revolution and he and his daughter, Princess Sylia, go to America. Sylvia brings the crown jewels. They are living incognito in an expensive suite in a New York City hotel but the proceeds from hocking the jewels aren't enough to maintain the standards they are trying to maintain, and they are forced to take lodging at the boarding house of Mrs. Schrapp. The landlady gets King Nicholas a job. While he is away, agents from the Republic of Santa Maria show up, and Sylvia flees and spends the night in a car in the showroom of an automobile agency. She tells the manager she is a super car seller, and he tells her to take care of a couple of shoppers. They are Tom Pettibone and his mother, who are trying to storm the gates of high society with their newly-acquired fortune. Tom becomes interested in Sylvia and introduces her at the country club as the Princess of Albania. Two crooks, Jim and Flo Doyle, are also in attendance masquerading of the King and Queen of Santa Maria.
