Shall I?

 With Lithuania in the throws of one of the worst recessions Europe has witnessed in recent years, young filmmaker Igor Drozdov faces one of the toughest decisions in his life. Stay in England, the country in which he has studied, worked and lived for the last 4 years or return home to Lithuania, to a family and country he loves. Split by his patriotic heart and cautious mind, Igor armed himself with his trusted JVC camera and a mind full of questions and set off on a trip to Lithuania, in the search of an answer. The result 'Shall I?' is a truthful, sometimes shocking, yet entirely honest dialog between a filmmaker and the ordinary 'every day' people of Lithuania.
