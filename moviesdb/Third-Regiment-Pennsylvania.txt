Third Regiment Pennsylvania

 "One of the crack Philadelphia regiments, headed by Col. Ralston, is here portrayed as they arrive in Philadelphia from the war. The boys, on the whole, look exceedingly well, which proves how sturdy and patriotic the American soldier is. Everyone is interested in the soldier boys. While, as a whole, the regiment returned in a very healthy condition, the results of four months' life in camps are plainly visible in the appearance of many of the men. A large number of them are extremely thin, some being changed so much as to make recognition by friends difficult. Quite a number of the soldiers who have returned with but little flesh were quite stout when they left the city. At first sight even immediate relatives failed to recognize some of the soldiers, on account of their bronzed faces. Some had also changed their appearance by raising full beards.
