Timor Lorosae - O Massacre Que o Mundo Não Viu

 In 1975, after the Carnation Revolution, Portugal abandoned their East Timor colony in the island of Timor. The locals proclaimed self-independents, but a couple of days later Indonesia invaded and occupied the East Timor lands. The East Timorese people was humiliated, murdered and slaughtered along twenty-four years, but resisted and fought for their independence. In 1999, the world finally saw the atrocities in this small country, where one third of the population was killed, and the United Nations organized a plebiscite to decide the destiny of East Timor, where the wish of independence won. But before leaving the country, the militias and the Indonesian military forces burnt 90% of East Timor. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was recognized as an independent nation in UN.
