Sorry About That Folks

 Tonight's the night. After years of time-consuming research, Howard feels ready to undertake the final stage of his quest. With the help of a drug used centuries ago by philosophers and thinkers, he hopes to unlock the doors to ultimate knowledge and, in so doing, to unleash the true potential of his mind. Everything's set up for the big experiment. Thanks to a fridge full of beer, Howard managed to convince his friend Frank to film the experiment so he can have a record of everything that goes on. Frank sets up his equipment, Howard swallows the drug, and the journey begins. But Howard is wholly unprepared for what he finds at the other end of the road. Something is lurking in the shadows, and there's only one thing Howard can do loose on an unsuspecting world?
