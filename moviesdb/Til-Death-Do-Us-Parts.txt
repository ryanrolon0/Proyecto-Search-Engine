Til Death Do Us Parts

 Joe is the owner of BS&F Auto Parts in the South Bronx and he works a lot. Being a hard worker runs in the family, first his Grandfather worked himself to death and recently Joe's father, who started the business, had a heart attack and died inside the store! Now Joe has a dilemma, he doesn't want to share the same fate as his predecessors. He has to change his business & life so he could one day retire. But there is high tension and stress in this culturally diverse workplace and at any moment it can turn into a brawl. So what should Joe do? Work until he drops? Or sit back and watch his family business die?
