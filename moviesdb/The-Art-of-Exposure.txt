The Art of Exposure

 The first Mega Muscle Expo was held in Las Vegas, Nevada and saw models and photographers from all over the world come together for this event. The Art of Exposure follows three of the world's top fitness models - Yvan Cournoyer, Lance LaMar and Derrick Davenport - through their work at the event, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes.
