Sex & Asparagus

 At a restaurant, we eavesdrop on the conversations of several pairs of people and one threesome. A man tells his date straight up what he wants and she replies with a devastating critique. A woman tells her mate that she wants a vibrator to spice up her life; he's defensive. A woman complains to a friend that her most recent date had too much foreplay. Two women talk to a guy who's a writer he drink less. Her friend listens. Two men talk about one's recent brush with homosexuality. When the evening ends, will there be any re-pairings?
