Shed Convention

 Cardiff, 2006. Ed has a good job in Health and Safety and the offer of a new promotion. But he's depressed and doesn't know why. Neither does housemate Luke, an IT consultant who discusses the meaning of life with Ed over Snooker. Conducting a risk assessment at a paper recycling plant, Ed sees a mysterious diagram for a time-travel device go by on the conveyer belt. With nothing to lose he builds it. And it works. Travelling in time, Ed has to work out how the device works and what it's telling him about his life. Luke urges him to take the promotion, but Ed comes to realise that perhaps Health and Safety doesn't rock his world after all. Maybe it's time to shed convention.
