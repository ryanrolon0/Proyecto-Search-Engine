Their Hero Son

 The old couple dreamed long of the return of their Hero Son. They had not heard from him in many years; so, one day, they wrote at random, sending many blessings. The Hero Son, leader of a band of mountain thieves, held up the mail man. By sheer chance, he came upon the pitiful letter. His heart melted, the years rolled back, and the Hero Son determined to give up the life and go home. On his way the sheriff got him, wounded him and searched him. The sheriff's heart was touched. He bore the fast dying man to the old homestead, pinned a sheriff's star upon and deposited him in the old mother's arms for the last time.
