Therapeutic Pink

 The hungry Pink Panther wanders the streets, and while longing for a bite to eat, a little dog bites his tail and refuses to let go, so he has to check into a hospital, where the doctor treats him as just another ill patient. Unhappy to be in the hospital, the panther tries to escape by disguising himself as a nurse and the dog as a baby under a blanket - but the plan fails. Finally the doctor gives him some Formula K-9 Dog Remover medicine, which helps, and the dog lets loose of the tail.
