The Second Degree

 Being six degrees away from your favorite movie star isn't all it's cracked up to be, as Penn (late 20s), discovers when he finds himself having to connect with five complicated suburban women on the road to meeting his idol. The spirit of his quest spreads into his group of friends - soon all of them consider moving out of their parents' basements to get on with their deeply underdeveloped 'lives'. With the hopes and dreams of several men in their late twenties riding on his shoulders, Penn feels the pressure of a modern-day low-income Odysseus even though the journey plays out more like a game than a lyric narrative. As the quest evolves; he begins to hear a famous voice urging him to 'cut loose'. As his motion-picture window of opportunity becomes a narrow portal of destiny, there is an ever-shrinking margin for distractions and certainly no time for an attachment to the most unexpected beauty that ever entered his life
