Saïd

 Saïd is convinced that life in Europe will be wonderful. The small boat in which he crosses the strait of Gibraltar is the first thing that disappoints him, and when he arrives in Barcelona, he realizes that an immigrant's life is not as easy as one may think. Only music and Anna will help him in the struggle against the rejection, the contempt and the difficult work conditions. But a violent encounter with some skinheads drastically changes everything. Saïd is forced to choose between pursuing the struggle to fulfill the dream that led him to emigrate and which, thanks to Anna's support, is now beginning to look possible, or acting according to his conscience and testifying against the skinheads, which would bring to light his illegal status and lead to immediate repatriation. It's time for Saïd to take his choice.
