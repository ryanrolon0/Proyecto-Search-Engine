The Awful Tooth

 A cat is being driven mad --- a short distance --- by an aching wisdom tooth and discovers in the Remedy Book a remedy that requires only the eating of a crow. The cat captures the first crow that comes along, but the crow is smarter than the cat, and offers other remedies, none of which call for crow-eating.
