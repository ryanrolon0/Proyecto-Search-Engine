The Signal

 In this new breed of science fiction, six people in four parallel stories are connected in ways they could have never imagined. In one story, Agents Nathan Lamb, Han Le, and Nick Thiel go on a quest to stop an alien invasion from occurring and through their turbulent journey of deception and lies, the true battle between good and evil begins. In our second story Andre and Sokhan find something in a closet that will change their lives forever. In our third story Sarah is keeping a secret from her boyfriend and the revelation will be more than he expected. Our fourth story follows the journey of the rogue agent, Cardoza, who deals with the pain and knowledge everyone needs to stop the end of the world.
