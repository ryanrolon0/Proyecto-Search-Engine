Psychoanalysis Changed My Life

 Marianne Loewe, a recently divorced, rather uptight college professor, is undergoing analysis with the elderly Dr. Anya Zurmer, a strict Freudian. About a month into Marianne's analysis, Dr. Zurmer suddenly chooses to abandon the rigid rules of psychoanalysis which have always guided her work. Marianne's relationship to Dr. Zurmer then becomes totally unorthodox and baffling to her and, for a while, to us. "Psychoanalysis Changed My Life" explores the path of this evolving relationship and the intriguing reasons for Dr. Zurmer's sudden change of method - and of heart.
