Pretty

 An experimental documentary love story revealed through the common intimacies of three women across three generations. The film explores the flawed perception of photographs as evidence from the perspective of a journalist. Photography, typography and animation are combined to create an intertwined narrative that shifts in time and perspective another, time moves backward and forward. Throughout it seeks beauty in the broken moments and damaged characters of real events, the hemophiliac's bleeding, the heroin addict, the illegal abortion, the playground of sewers, the stalker, the dead child, the cupboard of spices riddled with insects, the beating heart of a mutilated snake.
