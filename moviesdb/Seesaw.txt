Seesaw

 Makoto, a Japanese teacher, and Shinji, once an aspiring actor, have been living together for two years. When Shinji's friend gets married, he too begins to think about marriage. Makoto believes that marriage changes nothing, and thinks Shinji is naïve for thinking it does. She's too busy with her work and not interested in settling down. But one day, Makoto begins to realize she might be pregnant. The film captures the ambiance of a young modern day couple -chic and ennui and all- with free floating hand-held camera work and improvisation. On a seesaw, two people can enjoy a balancing act and feel the presence of the other without speaking a single word. Makoto is blessed with good friends, a rewarding job, and a peaceful life, but what happens when she loses that balance?
