Quarantined

 Raleigh and Alan are dying of a contagious, incurable disease. To make matters worse, they've also been quarantined against their will, in the middle of nowhere, cut off from all their family and friends. Just when they thought their lives couldn't get any worse, a man by the name of Waylan gets assigned to their house... and shows them just how good they really had it. "Quarantined" is a refreshingly comical and poignant story about regrets, tolerance and never taking life too seriously.
