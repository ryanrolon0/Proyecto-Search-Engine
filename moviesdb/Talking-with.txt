Talking with

 Adapted from the group of stage monologues by the pseudononymous "Jane Martin," this is a series of characters snake handler, daughter, baton twirler, washed-up rodeo cowgirl, tattoed woman, and older woman in the twilight of her years talking with us about their experiences, in the poetic language that Jane Martin is known for bringing to all her stage characters. Kathy Bates does a wonderful job of translating these dead-on characters (talking directly to camera) from stage to television screen, and television turns out to be the perfect medium for these challenging figures. "Jane Martin" first came to prominence at the prestigious Louisville-based Humana Theatre Festival it was recently revealed that "she" is none other than the Festival's artistic director, Jon Jory.
