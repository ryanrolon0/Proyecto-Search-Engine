The Tramp's Strategy That Failed

 Shows a bulldog lying on the ground outside a saloon door. An old tramp is thrown into the street by the saloon keeper, and is tackled by the bulldog. The tramp gets away from the bulldog, but shortly returns for revenge. This time he is protected with a large barrel, which encircles his entire body, and a soap box which covers his head. A laugh from start to finish.
