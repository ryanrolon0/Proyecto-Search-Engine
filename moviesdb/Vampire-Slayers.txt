Vampire Slayers

 In the year 2015 vampires are housed in a maximum-security prison. When ten vampires escape and threaten to infect the city, the only way they can be stopped is by slayers Christian (Russell Clay) and Dalton (George Nelson). After seeing their father killed by these demons, the only chance the city and doctor Danner's daughter has to survive are these two vampire slayers.
