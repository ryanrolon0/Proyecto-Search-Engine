The Paper

 The Paper takes an in-depth look at the pressures and problems of modern journalism as faced by the staff of a university newspaper embroiled in controversy. Following a year in the life of Pennsylvania State University's, The Daily Collegian, the film features first-time journalists struggling with the greatest challenges to the field circulation, barriers to investigative reporting, and criticism of coverage. The Paper is by turns inspiring and astonishing in its exploration of tomorrow's journalists wrestling with today's national media questions.
