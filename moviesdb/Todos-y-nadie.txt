Todos y nadie

 In this Latino road movie, we see two penniless guys returning to town through the desert, a poor man about to lose his job, and two men planning to rob a restaurant. Their lives are about to intersect... Where do they come from? Where are they going? "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone".
