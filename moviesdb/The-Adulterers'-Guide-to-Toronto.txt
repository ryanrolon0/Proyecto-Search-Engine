The Adulterers' Guide to Toronto

 The Adulterers' Guide To Toronto is an insightful, funny and twisted character study of two people on the verge of a divorce. Sitting in their marriage counselor's office, Oliver and Rav try to remember why he had the affair that ended their marriage. Their memories are chronicled as a highly subjective, episodic comedy weaving together monologues, still photographs, video, flashbacks within flashbacks and paranoid fantasies with incisive comments on love, sex, communication, life in Toronto, faith and faithfulness. Eventually one thing becomes clear to Oliver and Rav; It's not so much who you lie with as who you lie to.
