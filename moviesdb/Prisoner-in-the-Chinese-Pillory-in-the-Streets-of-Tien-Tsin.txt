Prisoner in the Chinese Pillory in the Streets of Tien Tsin

 A party of Chinese soldiers appear leading a prisoner with his arms bound behind him. They unbind him and he is placed in a pillory. A number of men pass who tease him unmercifully. Finally the soldiers return, and take him back to jail. Very good.
