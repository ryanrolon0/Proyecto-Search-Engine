Turn to the Wind

 'Turn to the Wind' is an aesthetic exploration of towering wind turbines in the unique landscape that surrounds them. The film is both a 'day in the life' of these amazing high-tech structures and an attempt to reconcile the new dynamic between landscape and technology in Southwest Saskatchewan.
