The March of Time

 The first of three reports in this episode of the March of Time series deals with Poland and the threat it faces (in 1937) from it's surrounding neighbors, particularly from Germany. The focus is on the challenge of the Polish corridor, which separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany and pretty well predicted an eventual war. The second story deals with the pet industry (described as $600 billion per year) including the animals (mostly dogs) and the various items that can be purchased for them. The last segment deals with the dust bowl phenomena that devastated millions of acre of once arable land in the US Midwest destroyed through poor land management and the foreclosure of farms during the Great Depression. It also focused on the major land reclamation project that was underway at that time.
