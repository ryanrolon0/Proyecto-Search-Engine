This Obedience

 A Lutheran congregation in Minnesota ordains an openly gay woman as its pastor, defying the orders of the national Lutheran organization and bringing down a firestorm of criticism and outrage from social conservatives both inside and outside the Lutheran Church. Rev. Anita C. Hill is a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church. She is also in a committed, monogamous relationship with her spouse, Janelle. This is the story of her struggle for acceptance, the story of her congregation and of an issue that is getting nationwide attention.
