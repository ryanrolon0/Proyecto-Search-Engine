Turn Me On, Dead Man

 A 1960's pop band that has reached the pinnacle of international popularity must suddenly cope with the accidental death of one of its most popular members. In an attempt to maintain their fame, they chose to cover up the tragedy and replace their band mate with a look-alike/sound-alike, hoping that their millions of fans will never notice.
