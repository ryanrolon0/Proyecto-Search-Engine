Trevor

 Trevor is your average 70's high schooler in Bible Belt, USA records, hangs out with his friends, and goes to the movies. But one day things change want to make out with the girls at a party. He starts to pay more attention to the other boys in his class. He starts to realize that people make fun of him for his love of ballet and theatre and Diana Ross. Eventually, Trevor comes to the realization that he's gay. Now, his friends don't want to be seen anywhere around him, his parents ignore him, his priest accuses him of being a pervert, and his best friend Pinky tells him that he's a weak person. With no one offering any support, Trevor decides to kill himself. But help comes in an unexpected form. It's 1981. Trevor, about 14, lives with his inattentive folks in suburbia. He keeps a diary, recording his descent from happiness. He sees himself as normal, loves Diana Ross and the theater, has a friend or two - including Pinky, a popular athlete. Trevor's not attracted to girls, but Pinky's friendship delights him. The word spreads that he's different, that he walks like girl, that he's gay. Pinky cuts him off. A confused Trevor tries self-imposed shock treatment. His parents read his diary and call a priest. Trevor's more and more unhappy with himself. With "Endless Love" on his stereo and wondering if people will cry at his funeral, he reaches for a bottle of pills.
