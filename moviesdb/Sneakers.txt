Sneakers

 SNEAKERS approaches the shoe as a cultural expression, an icon of modern times. Sneakers are much more then just shoes, the sneaker fits easily into the sports- as well as the fashion world, into pop music as well as highbrow art, on teen's and middle aged feet, in the U.S.A. as well as Nepal. In all those different types of sport, atmospheres, experiences, generations and topographically determined places the sneaker takes on the meaning that the specific group that adopts it attributes to the shoe like a chameleon. It is this function - the one as expression of a (sub)culture - of the sneaker that this documentary wants to explore. Sneakers will show the historical developments around the sport shoe from the first 'hit' the Converse All Star to the newest technological innovations on the one hand and the fashionable variations of the athletic shoe on the other. The shoe itself will be the pivotal element, the viewer will walk as it were on a large variety of sneaker models into different worlds and different times.
