Un amour de parapluie

 A Canadian visitor to the French capital would like very much to find a girlfriend but he is timid on the one hand and he has only a married couple of friends there on the other. The husband advises him to resort to the "umbrella trick", a strategy that can be applied only in the rain. The tactics works as follows young lady who has none, the girl asks him his address to take it back to him and it's in the pocket! This is easier said than done though, and it will take the Canadian a dozen unfruitful attempts before he does find his soul mate.
