 Indian Army lawyer, Major Siddhant Chaudhary, has not only to deal with his father's death, but must also defend Captain Javed Khan. The later, charged with killing a decorated Major Virendra Singh Rathore, under various statutes of Indian laws & the Army Act, refuses to defend himself, admits to this killing, and awaits a guilt finding via a Court Martial. Siddhant decides to delve deeper, much to the chagrin of his prosecutor-friend, Major Akash Kapoor, not realizing that he will incur the wrath of his superiors; his work will come under sharp scrutiny; the journalist, Kaavya Shastri, assisting him will be arrested; and he may end up being transferred to violent and isolated areas in Assam and Bihar.
