Unemployment

 My documentary is related to Unemployment and recession. People after losing job, they are killing families and themselves world wide. After reading those heart wrenching news, it made me to make a documentary on government benefits and other social benefits in each country to utilize after laid off from work. I want to spread the message to the world that don't kill yourself and your family because of just losing job, see how many benefits you have from government and others.And I want to share the message 'unemployment is not a crime' with the world.
