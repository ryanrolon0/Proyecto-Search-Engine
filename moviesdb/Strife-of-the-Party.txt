Strife of the Party

 Claude Clayton expects his boss and his wife for a dinner he is going to cook. He goes to the neighbors, who, unknown to him are crooks, to borrow a few needed-items for his dinner for The Barkers. They ask him to keep a stolen wrist watch. His wife, Vera, finds it and thinks it is a surprise present for her. Whedn the Barkers arrive, Mrs. Barker is hysterical over the robbery of her watch...which Vera now has.
