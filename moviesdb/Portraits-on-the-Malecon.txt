Portraits on the Malecon

 Portraits on the Malecon explores the social uses of Havana, Cuba's 'urban sofa,' a 7-kilometer long wall called the 'malecon' (seawall), where everything one does on a sofa at night or day, is done in public, beside the sea, beneath the sky, in the open air, where the natural and urban environment meet.
