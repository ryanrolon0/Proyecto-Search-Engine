The Association

 When horror romance novelist John Cassidy and his family move to the sleepy suburbs of Harker Heights, they realize John's new found fame comes with a "Price". The neighborhood is populated by a bickering couple, an overzealous ex-cop, a boozing playboy, a nosy neighbor, and a mysterious Homeowners Association head, just like any other upper middle class enclave. But when the busybody turns wallflower, the womanizer becomes more interested in raw meat than female flesh, and unsolved murders begin to pile up, John gets suspicious. He soon discovers the HOA leader, Mr. Price and his minions are even more sinister than they seem. When Price kidnaps John's daughter, he is forced to spring into action and with the aid of his slacker brother Bobby, a rag-tag team of neighbors and guidance from his sleazy agent Vincent Graves, he begins to wage a battle between good and evil. The crew of misfits face a lineup of creatures that seem torn from the pages of John's novels, but the most evil of them may be his agent who proves greed is the worst monster of all. A climactic battle in a classic setting finds John and his gang of ne'er-do-wells in a life or death struggle to find the truth, rescue his daughter, save his neighborhood and perhaps the world.
