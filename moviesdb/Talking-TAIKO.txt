Talking TAIKO

 Japanese director Yoshiaki Tago documents the thoughts and performances of bilingual and bicultural poet Yuri Kageyama. She collaborates with musicians, including percussionist Winchester Nii Tete from Ghana, and other artists to examine issues of racism and sexism as well as universal themes like sexuality and death. The film becomes a poetic statement not only of contemporary Tokyo but a personal transformation of a director who finds he himself is changing as he follows Kageyama and her works.
