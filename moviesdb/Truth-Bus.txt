Truth Bus

 Ten activists travel across Canada in a bright blue bus, engaging people in conversation about 9/11. What they find surprises them. In light of the continuing war in Afghanistan, more and more Canadians are demanding to know what really happened that day. We may be fooling ourselves when we think of 'truth' as a destination. Perhaps the truth highway stretches to infinity and in the end, we discover that it was all about the journey after all. The truth bus is an invitation to hop on. It is a story generator, an emissary and a rolling work of art. This film will not tell you what to think, but it may inspire all of us to live a little closer to our own highest truth.
