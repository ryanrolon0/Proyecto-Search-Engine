Shocktrooper

 A video game junkie/stoner is convinced his brutal flashbacks aren't from addiction to his favorite game, but from a secret mission in Iran as an elite Shocktrooper, a mission the military has erased from his memory, leaving him with PTSD. This is the opening set-up of a longer film.
