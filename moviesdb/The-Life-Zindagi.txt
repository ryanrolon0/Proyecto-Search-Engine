The Life Zindagi

 Pretty Priya (Girija) has a boyfriend in Rohit, who is the Manager of the Hotel she is employed with. One day she sees him in bed with another woman, and breaks-up with him. She then dramatically finds employment with Kamal Kumar (Arun Bakshi) as a Nurse/Nanny for his ill son, Yash (Swapnil Joshi), who has brain-tumor. Under her care, he shows signs of recovery and both fall in love with each other. Priya is thrilled that she has found her soul-mate but does not know that he has kept two secrets from her.
