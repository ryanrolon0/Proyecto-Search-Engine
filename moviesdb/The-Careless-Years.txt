The Careless Years

 Two high-school seniors teenagers, from different social standings, have a date and when the girl resists the boy's romantic advances, he begins to think of her as someone special, and thinks they should get married immediately. Both sets of parents object and urge patience, but when the girl is told she is to take a long summer vacation with her parents, the boy talks her into going over the border to Mexico and getting married. The boy's father is so upset that he comes to blows with his son. The son realizes he has been wrong and goes to the girl's home to say goodbye, and wait for the time when they are both older and wiser before taking on the responsibilities of a marriage.
