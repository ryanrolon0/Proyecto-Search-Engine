Unimatrix 384

 A sci-fi allegory set in a distant galaxy in the 32nd century, 'Unimatrix 384' follows young space pirates Logan Freeman and Jessica Clarke as they arrive at a remote facility on the planet Haklos V. Having escaped from government agents and opportunistic bounty hunters on Jupiter VII, Logan and Jessica search for the device that will read the disc that they're being hunted for. The startling revelations that follow lead Logan and Jessica to make a crucial decision, one that could alter the fates of two worlds, Earth IV and Ceti Omega, engaged in a decades-long interstellar war.
