Tweet and Lovely

 Sylvester Cat's new hang-out is an inventor's lab, which is near Tweety Bird's house atop a pole. Guarding Tweety's house is a bulldog named Spike. Sylvester invents all kinds of contraptions including a storm cloud, a robot dog, invisible paint, and a retracting grabber. The bulldog foils all Sylvester's attempts to catch Tweety with these inventions.
