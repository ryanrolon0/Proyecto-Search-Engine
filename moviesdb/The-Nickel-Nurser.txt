The Nickel Nurser

 A wealthy man wants his three free-spending daughters, who are in their twenties, to learn fiscal discipline. An attorney suggests that Charley, an efficiency expert, move in and provide guidance. The young women play a trick on the stiff-necked Charley by having Thelma, one of the sisters, switch places with Greta, their garboesque maid. Greta plays her part well, vamping and flirting with Charley, to the chagrin of her husband, the butler. Eventually, Charley smells a rat and, in his nightshirt, confronts Thelma in her bedroom. Lessons in frugality give way to farce as a shotgun and suit of armor provide the props of a dEnouement.
