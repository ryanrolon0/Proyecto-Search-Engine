Waiting for Summer

 When are you really ready to love or to be loved? Zach and Chantal go through trails in tribulations through Fall, Winter and Spring to heal wounds of the past. Now, does Summer mean love? The parallel, that they both live in Toronto may seem very trivial at first but soon they figure out the journey they took to arrive there and the journey they will have take has lot more parallels. On that journey they discover that healing wounds can come at unforeseen costs.
