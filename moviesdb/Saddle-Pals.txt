Saddle Pals

 Gene, representing the ranchers whose rents have been raised again, goes to see Waldo Brooks, the man responsible. Brooks, a nervous wreck who wants to get away from it all, deeds his Company to Gene and flees. As the new president, Gene finds the Company is in financial trouble and he must raise $50,000 as his share or everything is lost. He sets out to raise the money but there are those who want to take over and they intend to make sure he fails.
