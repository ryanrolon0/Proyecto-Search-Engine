Un coup d'oeil par Etage

 This picture is truly what its name implies. A large apartment house interior on the ground floor is seen in the opening, when the porter is seen to receive the mail for the tenants from the postman. He ascends the stairs, meanwhile dusting the walls and balustrade, and in vain endeavors to read some of the letters through the envelopes, but while he cannot discern the exact contents of the letters, he peeps in the keyhole of every room and discovers many interesting things that appear to occupy his mind and afford him much merriment. He finally reaches the top floor, but on looking through the keyhole of the room on that floor, he discovers the tenant thereof enveloped in flames in his mad endeavor to extinguish a fire. The porter rushes down stairs to give the alarm, but meanwhile the man on fire bursts from the room and falls in a faint. By this time the firemen have arrived and they proceed to carry the hose through the house directly to the fire on the top floor. One fireman hero seizes the burning man while several others rescue women and children from the different rooms now filled with smoke and about to burst into flame. The firemen haul their apparatus right into the large hallway, where they finally extinguish the fire. Very exciting.
