The Flunky

 Rock star Tyler Mann is in search of a new flunky - Enter Sammy Bestone. Crashing rent free in Tyler's LA compound Sammy and Tyler develop a curious but strong bond. Closer than Siegfried and Roy. They share everything. Women, gambling debts, laughs and rock-n-roll. But it's not all good times. Their dual gambling habit leads them to the magnetic and beautiful Sondra whom both have promptly fallen in love with! Tyler's unpredictable persona has him abusing poor Sammy at his every whim. But Sammy hangs tough. He know that theirs is a co-dependant relationship.
