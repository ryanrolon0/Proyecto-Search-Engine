 Elaine is traveling to South Africa to part from her elderly mother. Rebecca is traveling to her village to visit her children who she has left to work in the city. Lullaby is about my two mothers. I am accompanying on their journeys in South Africa and embarking on a journey of my own, to recapture my childhood memories, so that I can discover the meaning of motherhood. In a world with a global economy, the comfort of the First World is guaranteed by women from the Third World who clean their houses, raise their children and care for the aged. The price of feminism for the women in the First World is paid by the women from the Third World who leave their families and children in order to enable the women in the First World to have the freedom they enjoy. In South Africa, this phenomenon is particularly widespread, as the rich white home owners there are able to afford black women from the townships who work in their homes, look after their children and clean their houses. I would like to understand this phenomenon through two women in South Africa worked for 10 years as nursemaid and household help in my house while her four children stayed at home with their grandmother. The second is Elaine, my biological mother, who left home in order to support our family, but who could only do so only because Rebecca could care for her children. What influence has this had on the relationship between Rebecca and her children then and today? And what influence has it had on my relationship with my mother now? I would like to understand how such a situation could arise, in which neither of the two women was able to raise her own children - not in the First World, and not in the Third. What is the meaning of the word "motherhood" in the changing reality of the global village? .
