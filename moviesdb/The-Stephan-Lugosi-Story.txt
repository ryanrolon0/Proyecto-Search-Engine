The Stephan Lugosi Story

 Stephan Lugosi (Csaba S. Lucas) is in trouble. It is not an easy job to be an almost movie star these days. In less than ten minutes we join the half naked hero on a magical trip from the life of a movie star to the Wild West, from the world of gangsters to a blind man, from a mentor by circumstance to two love stories. Anyone can stay alive, but only a few can pull the trigger.
