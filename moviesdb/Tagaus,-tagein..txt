 For over fifty years, Thresl Handl has run the Harhamhof, high in the Austrian Alps, alone. Day in, day out, she works the farm and runs the guesthouse; the views are breath-taking, the work, relentless. In April she will be 99 years old, yet for her guests, she remains mistress of a timeless world. But not everyone likes how Thresl manages the Harhamhof. Thresl's determination to keep working denies her son, Hans, his chance to run the inn. A documentary about persistence, will power and the beauty and dignity of old age.
