Session 2601

 Session 2601 tells the story of Robert Nelson and his visit with Dr. Lanner, a woman capable of opening his mind, and forcing him to interact with twenty year old memories. Undergoing the psychiatric procedure, Robert chooses to return to the last time he saw his six year old daughter, over twenty years ago. On the evening of his return, he enters his home with loving wife and daughter, ready for a quiet night. During dinner, two men enter their house and take hostage his daughter. Both Robert and Lena snap into action, pulling weapons and taking up defensive positions. After a tense stand-off, Robert convinces Lena to abandon their daughter and escape. As the memory and session come to an end, Dr. Lanner suffers from a slight pain caused by the process. Robert exits the office, leaving Dr. Lanner to cope with what she just experienced.
