The Resurrection Apprentice

 Forced into the "trade" by circumstance, Arthur must prove himself capable of the gritty and disturbing task of stealing the dead. Willie, a hardened Resurrection Man, shows Arthur the ropes while deciding whether or not the boy is worth more to him alive or dead. The Resurrection Apprentice is an atmospheric short in the tradition of the period pot boilers of Terence Fisher and Roger Corman.
