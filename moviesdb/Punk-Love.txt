Punk Love

 Set in the rainy environs of Oregon and Washington, Punk Love is the story of two forlorn lovers, searching for that elusive Hollywood Ending to the story of their dreams. Sarah is a lost 15-year-old, trapped in an unloving home, in a dreary small paper mill town. When she meets Spike, she envisions a new life for herself. Falling in love, Sarah and Spike go on a crime spree of small-time con jobs, both to support themselves and their drug habit. Spike has dreams of his own, and when he successfully auditions for a band, he can't help but feel that he and Sarah are starting on the road to escaping their ill-fated existence. But just as things are looking up, everything goes uncontrollably wrong, and Spike and Sarah have only their undying love for each other as a means of survival against all odds. Director/writer Nick Lyon's Punk Love is a modern-day fairy tale about two fallen angels searching for meaning in a world without pity. As Spike, Chad Lindberg gives an outstanding performance as a man-child whose love knows no bounds, even when such bounds are called for. Emma Bing, as Sarah, is achingly vulnerable as a teenager desperate to keep a glimmer of hope alive of the better life she dreams of. In the end, all Spike and Sarah have are each other, and their love for one another, a love that can't be torn apart. Unconditional love.
