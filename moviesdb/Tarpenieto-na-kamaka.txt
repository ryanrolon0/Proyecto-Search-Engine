Tarpenieto na kamaka

 In a God-forsaken village somewhere in the eastern part of Rhodopes Mountains a bunch of old men and women carry on the remains of their days. They live bound to their own existence just like Sisyphus and the stone. The film story takes place within a single day - twenty-four hours before Christmas.
