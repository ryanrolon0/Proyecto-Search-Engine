Quiet! Pleeze

 Poopdeck Pappy has a hangover (though he won't admit to Popeye that's the problem). He asks Popeye to help him by keeping the noise down. Among the disturbances he deals with milk truck, a factory whistle, a radio, a traffic accident, a construction site, a blasting site (the Sparber construction company) this one takes spinach. He gets home and hears a party going on upstairs where a recovered Pappy is living it up.
