Seanchai

 In the Irish tradition, stories are woven with truth and lies. Milton Grace is a bartender and harp player in the small town of Wakefield, Quebec who lives by the tenets of the Irish bards. Seanchai is his story. He spins a tale of a dark past filled with loss and an uncertain future. But don't be deceived; as they say, you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story.
