Seal of Lilith

 A timeless story of erotic manipulation and deceit given through a visual exploration of a series of almost static live-action paintings referencing archetypal images and characters such as Adam, Lilith, Cain and Abel. In a reversal of the traditional biblical tale, Fallen Adam passes on the fruit of knowledge onto Lilith, who takes a bite and thus receives the concept of sin. We then see Lilith and Abel hosting a feast, the Feast of Euphoria. With fake smiles drawn symbolically on their faces, Lilith passes on the sin onto the others, tainting everyone with her deceit, while trying to present the couple's relationship as idyllic and euphoric. In a familiar gesture that references the Last Supper, we can also see Enos whispering something into Cain's ear. Only later can we connect the dots... A love scene between Abel and Lilith ensues, first from the distorted point of view of Lilith. This appears idyllic and romantic. The truth though is far darker than this manifestations of Lilith. In the first we see her as a praying Mantis, which cuts off the male's head after they consummate. In the second, she is an Arachne (spider) spinning the web of deceit around Abel, blinding him from the truth. Finally we see Lilith in all her glory as a Leech, sucking Abel's life out through her slithering tentacles. In the last and final act comes the resolution. Abel has become aware of the dark truth, of the fact that Lilith has an affair with his own blood, his own brother, Cain. In a twist on the biblical tale, we see Cain and Abel about to have a gentlemen's duel. But Cain has truly received the Seal Of Lilith and deceiveth his brother once more...
