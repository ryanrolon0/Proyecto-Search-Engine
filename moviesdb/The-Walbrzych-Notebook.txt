The Walbrzych Notebook

 A sort of anthropological portrait of the Polish town of Walbrzych, a former mining site active until the 90s, today in crisis, due to the closing up of the mines and the consequent firing of hundreds of workers. The film is conceived like a sort of music composition, a score combining natural sounds, speeches, instrumental music, as well as images.
