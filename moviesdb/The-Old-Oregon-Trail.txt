The Old Oregon Trail

 A band of settlers on the Oregon Trail is attacked by outlaws, who steal their horses. The horses are returned and the outlaws chased off by three cowboys who just happen to pass by. Years later, the three cowboys again save the settlers when they are threatened by some rebellious farmworkers.
