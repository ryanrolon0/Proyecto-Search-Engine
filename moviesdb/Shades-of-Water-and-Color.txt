Shades of Water and Color

 Shades of Water and Color is a foray into 'micro-environments' that would typically remain unnoticed in the usual hustle and bustle of daily life, and explores the play of light, shadow, and reflections within the intimate setting of a stream where water striders and water bugs are free to dance and show both their playful and darker sides. The camera work has been done in such a way that each frame visually captures the spirit of 'abstract' still photography, while at the same time serving as a visual counterpart to the music improvisations the film is based on.
