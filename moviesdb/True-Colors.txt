True Colors

 This compelling story speaks strongly about the power one holds when the desire for love and acceptance penetrates the walls of hatred and adversity. The heart of the filmmaker shines through as the words and visual images prompt us to think about the ramifications of a society absent of human compassion. 'Nick Bueno' (qv), 'Dean Cassidy' (qv), 'Lee Peach (III)' (qv) and 'Derek Sandoval' (qv) are four twenty-something gay men. Each candidly discusses his coming out period, his experience as a gay man in a predominantly straight oriented world, those experiences especially with regard to any homophobic attacks against him either physical or emotional, and his take on being gay as opposed to being straight. Lee also speaks of his HIV positive status and how it has affected his life. In the end, each just wants to be loved and accepted for who he is and not just for being gay. This documentary also remembers homosexual men and women who have since passed on due to society not accepting who they were.
