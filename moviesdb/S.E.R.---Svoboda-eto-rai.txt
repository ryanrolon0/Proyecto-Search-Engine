S.E.R. - Svoboda eto rai

 Young Sasha is brought into a state-run children's home because his mother died early and his father spends most of his life in prison. The conditions are like in a penal institution. Sasha tries several times to escape and to search for his father. Inspired by true events, FREEDOM IS PARADISE is the tale of a fiercely independent boy and his quest for the father he has never known. A journey through the dark underside of the Soviet working class and institutional life, FREEDOM IS PARADISE captures a boy's fierce capacity to dream amidst the boldfaced cruelty of circumstance.
