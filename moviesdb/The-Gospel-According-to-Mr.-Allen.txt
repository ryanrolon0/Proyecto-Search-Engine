The Gospel According to Mr. Allen

 When James Allen opened the Addicts Rehabilitation Center in Harlem it was New York State's first residential treatment center for people without money. Forty three years later, the center is still an embattled facility in the center of some of America's meanest streets. But the doors are still open, and, to date, over 25,000 troubled people have come through them. "The Gospel According to Mr. Allen" follows three addicts through A.R.C, as they try to break the grip of drugs. Peter wants to stay out of jail. Michelle would like to get her children back. And Brett hopes for a record contract. But any of them really make it? Can the battle against poverty, hopelessness and addiction ever be won? The Addicts Rehabilitation Center offers a unique perspective. Famed for its tough-love, trash talking staff as well as its Gospel Choir, A.R.C. continues to write the rules. This is a compassionate film about people who never give up on people. The results will surprise you.
