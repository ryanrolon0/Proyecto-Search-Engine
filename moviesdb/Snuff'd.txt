Snuff'd

 The film depicts the beginning of the end for Lestor Mustio as he takes on a new approach to his photography by starting a collection entitled, 'Snuff'd.' Inspired by a photo of a crime scene in the local newspaper, Les places an ad offering free head shots to lure models to his apartment. What they don't know is they're never making it out alive. The film dramatically recounts the last three months in the life of Lestor Mustio. Les lives a very solitary and mundane life - no wife, no friends, no family. Lost since the day of his father's death, Les has struggled to find meaning in his tumultuous life. To preoccupy his mind, he picks up his camera and changes his job as a photographer into an obsession.
