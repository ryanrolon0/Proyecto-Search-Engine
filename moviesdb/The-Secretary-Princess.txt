The Secretary Princess

 A private eye discovers that a beautiful secretary is really the uncrowned ruler of a foreign country. When the buxom beauty refuses to believe the detective, the gumshoe captures her and ties her up in an effort to transport the princess to her native land. A beautiful royal investigator, following the same trail, thinks the detective is the assassin sent by her highness' enemies to kill her before she can ascend her throne. Unfortunately for the good gals the real murderer shows up and captures all three ladies, intending to take them on a one-way trip to oblivion. Can the resourceful ladies escape before they meet their doom?
