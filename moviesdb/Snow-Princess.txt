Snow Princess

 The world had come of age, and St. Elmo, Protector of the vast, cold polar lands, decided that his presence was no longer needed for he was tired, the days weighed heavily upon him, and the hour had come for him to rest. He called this place Scintella, Christmasland, and in his wisdom he sanctioned an oracle, Markos, to whom he granted special powers of the universe. St. Elmo fashioned his bond with humanity in the form of a baby girl, and presented her to his great friend St. Nicholas, whose deeds bring happiness to all the children of the world. The years passed by and the baby girl matured into a lovely young woman known throughout the land as Princess Auroele of Scintella, the daughter of St. Nicholas, the Snow Princess. He took from his magical cloak a single gleaming gemstone and laid it in a secret place, an ice mountain. Only when the Princess and the gemstone were united in danger would St. Elmo awaken from his eternal rest and save humanity.
