Tim Juniverse

 Tim Juniverse is the son of a deceased famous archaeologist Jim Juniverse. He now works in a boring and stressful job but all that changes when he finds out from his doctor that he has a rare ancient disease and will die in 1 hour. The only thing that the doctor could have done to save him is make him a soup out of an ancient pair of magical socks that are now long lost. Ironically Tim's father discovered these exact socks and hid them. Tim knows where they are, he rushes to retrieve them for the doctor, but on his way back, is intercepted by a dangerous alien being demanding those socks, preventing him from getting back in time.
