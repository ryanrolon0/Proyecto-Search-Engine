The Grandfather Paradox

 THE GRANDFATHER PARADOX is a funny short film that explores the infamous causality paradox, that is, if one is able to travel back in time and succeed in killing his grandfather before he can reproduce, who exactly is it that traveled back? Indeed this is the predicament Professor Thaddeus finds himself in. His grandson has traveled from the future to solve this paradox once and for all. As the rumor of the grandson's visit runs through the university, students pack Professor Thaddeus' classroom to see who will be proven right.
