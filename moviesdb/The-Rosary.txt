The Rosary

 Bruce Wilton has amassed a fortune which he lavishes on his wife Vera. But a note of menace creeps into their happy home. No one hears it at first, except Father Kelly, a priest and Bruce's former tutor. The priest goes quietly to work with his sharpened mental sense to find the person who is causing the adverse influence in the house-hold. When he is on the verge of discovering the cause, calamity sweeps in on Bruce; his fortune is swept away and in a manner that he believe his wife was the cause of his ruin.Husband and wife are separated, divorced and their home is destroyed, and yet the cause remains unknown. But Father Kelly, with his faith that moves mountains, goes on quietly, serenely and confident with but one purpose in mind - the happiness of those he loves.
