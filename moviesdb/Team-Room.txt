Team Room

 Team Room tells the story of Josh Kaplan, a young man who returns to his high school to become the new basketball coach. But Josh is haunted by the memory of Dre, his best friend, who died on the night of their last game almost 10 years ago. Will the mystery of Dre's death ever be solved? Is there more than just a memory haunting Josh, or is he losing his grip on reality? And is there a more profound reason for Josh's sudden return to the high school after all these years?
