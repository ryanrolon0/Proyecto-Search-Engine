Pool Critters

 In a dilapidated bar at the edge of the city, local patrons find themselves in the midst of an inept traveler from another world. A creature beneath their noses, attempting to collect knowledge and information for his home planet, but consistently failing at every turn. A being of such incompetence and stupidity, that only under the watchful eye of his loyal sidekick does he accomplish anything.
