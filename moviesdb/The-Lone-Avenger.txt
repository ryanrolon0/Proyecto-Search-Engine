The Lone Avenger

 Cal Weston, after an absence of many years (in a remake of his 1930 Universal film "The Fighting Legion"), rides into Mesa to visit his father, co-partner of the town bank with Jud Winters. Cal discovers the sheriff and the coroner, Doctor Crandall in his father's office examining his body with Crandall rendering a verdict of suicide. Cal knows it wasn't suicide as the gun is in his right hand and John Weston was left handed, and he cautions Winters, the only person in town who knows his true identity, not to reveal it. Cal then begins his quest to find the killer and the motive, a quest hampered when the bank's crooked bookkeeper Martin Carter has his henchman Burl Adams and two accomplices ambush and shoot the examiner from the country seat, and then has a fake examiner declare that the bank has been looted by John Weston, and Carter declares that Cal, whose true identity has been learned, knows where the money is. Maynard, as usual, gets tied up in order his give his horse "Tarzan" a chance at untying the sugar-coated, loosely tied rope. Cal arrives at his father's bank to find him dead. It is pronounced a suicide but Cal sees the gun is in the wrong hand. The bank examiner is then waylaid and replaced by a fake who claims Cal's father looted the bank. When Cal is run out of town, he finds the wounded examiner and now he konws who the murderer is.
