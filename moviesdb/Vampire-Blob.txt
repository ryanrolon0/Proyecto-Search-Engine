Vampire Blob

 An evil half-superhero, half-vampire creature seeks the hand of the daughter of the Mayor of Innocentville; she only loves her lowly chicken-feed boy, who is seeking revenge on his Opium-addict school tutor. The dead return to life and Vampire Blob grows to city-smashing proportions; only the most humble of animals can save the day!
