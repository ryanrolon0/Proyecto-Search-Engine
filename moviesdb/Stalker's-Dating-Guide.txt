Stalker's Dating Guide

 Is it merely "creative observation" or is it really stalking? It can't be stalking if they end up liking you...Dr.Ryan Boise, with his online PhD from Pattison University in Alaska, proudly leads the Stalkers Anonymous group. In his meetings, which are held in a castle, he explores their improper dating techniques. We have Stacey Wolfe's over the top denial of stalking and Janet admitting she kept a finer in her freezer from an ex. Susan who merely drives 10 miles out of her way to accidentally see her crush. And one Columbian soap opera actor that thinks he is at an audition. A few other colorful characters complete the group. So remember...Date don't Stalk...and we can help!!
