The Next Frontier

 While fossil fuels foul the planet and greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, this one-hour documentary moves beyond arguing about whether or not climate change is real. Instead, it explores solutions. As host (Good Morning America's Tech Reporter) Becky Worley frames it, "If your house is burning, you don't argue about who started it or whether to call it a blaze or an inferno. You put out the fire!"
