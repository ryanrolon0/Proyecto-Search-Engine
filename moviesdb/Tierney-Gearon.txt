Tierney Gearon

 In 2002, American photographer Tierney Gearon (1963- ), fresh from the disconcerting success of her 2001 exhibit at London's Saatchi Gallery, goes to upstate New York to begin a project photographing her mother. Over the next few years, two filmmakers record Gearon's visits, accompanied by her two young children and later a baby. Gearon's mother can behave erratically, and the presence of mother, daughter, and children brings up Gearon's own feelings about her childhood. Her children are philosophical about being photographed and on exhibition. Portraits of family, discovery, and healing may emerge.
