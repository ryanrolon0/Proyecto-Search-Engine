Slightly Scandalous

 There are two twin brothers (actually triplets in the final scene), one of whom has three girls on a romantic string and is trying to sell a television show to a fountain pen manufacturer. The other doesn't have one girl and quietly sells insurance. The insurance seller invests money in his brother's show and, in the process of protecting his investment, gets involved with his twin's romances. Things eventually work out and the TV promoter winds up with the manufacturer's daughter and the salesman with Sheila Ryan. Lita Baron gets to dance a few numbers with the music of the Guadalajara Trio, and Nick Moro & Frank Yaconelli, the old vaudeville team that was seen together mostly in Tom Keene westerns at Monogram in the early 1940's.
