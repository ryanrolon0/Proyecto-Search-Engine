Talking in Your Sleep

 This is the dark, moody tale of a neglected housewife who discovers she can escape her loneliness and recover a sense of interaction with her husband by having conversations with him... while he's talking in his sleep. But she can't escape her suspicion that her husband is having an affair with a teenage girl. Her paranoia seeps insidiously into her newfound fantasy life and overwhelms it - destroying everything in its wake.
