The Pussycat Preacher

 Lovable x-stripper turned evangelist, Heather Veitch starts a ministry to help women in the sex industry. Her mission of love persuades a young Christian pastor and a few women from her church to join her. Heather calls her group JC's Girls and starts taking the team to strip clubs and porn conventions to reach out to lap dancers, hookers, and porn queens. Ironically, the sex industry welcomes JC's Girls, but powerful forces in the Christian church refuse to tolerate Heather's "immoral ministry." Heather receives hate mail and death threats accusing her of "prostituting the Gospel." But she refuses to back down, setting the stage for a climactic showdown that threatens to bring down her pastor and his church!
