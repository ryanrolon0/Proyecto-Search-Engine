Rick's Canoe

 Rick comes to Santa Fe to reunite with his best friend Jules. They are in search of good times, women and some answers to life's riddles. They go to a men's group for help and meet up with other lost souls. Soon they are entangled in a web spewed by Santa Flakey therapist Deirdre. Rick must now confront his harsh father played by veteran screen actor Valentin DeVargas.
