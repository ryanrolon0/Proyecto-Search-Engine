Red Harvest

 Three drug dealers - Spence, Adam, and Jess - load a hollowed-out passenger van with marijuana and hit the back roads of Indiana on their way to a major sale. A momentary lapse of concentration results in a tragic accident - or does it? Jess is sure Spence hit a small child on the roadside, but there's no body. Investigating a nearby farm house while looking for help, the trio finds themselves ensnared in a cryptic, violent cycle of retribution channeled through the most unlikely of vessels.
