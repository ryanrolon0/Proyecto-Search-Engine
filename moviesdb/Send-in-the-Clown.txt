Send in the Clown

 In a distant, lonely saloon, set in the old west, whiskey is the only desire. The inhabitants of this space are a breed of their own. The Bleak. The sedated. They are seduced by a dream and trapped in their own reality. They are neither moving forward nor back. The saloon is their purgatory.
