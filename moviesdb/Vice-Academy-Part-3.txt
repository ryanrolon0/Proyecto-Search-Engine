Vice Academy Part 3

 Two sisters in the Vice Academy try to thwart the crime wave wrought by escaped convict Malathion, who got her name after being exposed to toxic chemicals. An honest new recruit does such a good job at arresting Malathion's gang that the sisters are taken off active duty. To get their jobs back, they try to tarnish the new girl's reputation.
