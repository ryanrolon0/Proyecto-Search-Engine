The Grove

 More Americans have been lost to AIDS than in all the U.S. wars since 1900. But few know of the existence of the national AIDS memorial, a seven-acre grove and sanctuary hidden in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. THE GROVE shows how one community responded to its overwhelming grief, and how the seeds of a few visionaries blossomed into something larger and more provocative than they could have imagined. How do we mark a time of unimaginable loss? How do we remember those that could be forgotten?
