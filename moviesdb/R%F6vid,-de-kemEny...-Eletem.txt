Rövid, de kemEny... Eletem

 KornEl's living the cozy life of bachelors. Not long after his 30th birthday he finds out that his palm has a life line a great deal shorter than usual. According to the fortune teller, several constellations suggest that a terrible event will end his life, unless he can have a baby soon. When his shop is attacked by two terrorist bombers, and a psychopath serial killer dressed as an easter-bunny tries to take his life, KornEl begins to take the oracle's words seriously. He faces a series of bizarre situations in his struggle to find a woman willing to bear his child and change his destiny.
