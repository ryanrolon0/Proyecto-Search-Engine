The Building of Good and Evil

 The war between the forces of good and evil is over and all the demons and angels coincidentally move into the same old apartment building in Los Angeles. To pay the rent, they get jobs in "the industry" thus explaining why directors, executives, lawyers, casting, agents, and script doctors are "evil" and P.A.'s, post production and writers are "good" while all actors are doomed to go to hell (on a slip and slide). Angela, an innocent aspiring actress and only human resident, juggles between her acting career and dealing with her colorful and other-worldly neighbors.
