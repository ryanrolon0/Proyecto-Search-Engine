The Last Installment

 In his prison cell, Clyde reads about the glamorized life story of Bull Moose Brannigan, a 1920's gangster, in installments in a magazine. He dreams of the day when he gets out and can enjoy the life he reads about. As the day of freedom approaches, the warden shows Clyde how Brannigan ended up, i.e., "the last installment."
