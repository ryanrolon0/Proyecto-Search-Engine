Polygamy 2

 Okafor, the chief of the Igbo community of Lagos, dies, leaving behind a large estate worth a lot of money. When two men, elders of the Igbo community, try to divvy up his estate among his surviving relatives, various other wives and concubines reveal themselves, complicating matters further, which leads to deadly consequences as the various women connive against each other.
