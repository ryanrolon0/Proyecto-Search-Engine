Sniff

 Sniff is a documentary wrapped in a fictional story. Two British actors, hired to be dress-up concierges at a high-end San Francisco dog hotel, decide to use the opportunity of their year-long contract to make a documentary about dogs. The trouble is, they're not quite making the same film. Starring Neil Morrissey, Amanda Plummer, Mikey the Guide Dog, Gabby the Search and Rescue Dog, and a host of playful canines, this film is a delightful, informative treat for the whole family.
