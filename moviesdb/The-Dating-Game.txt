The Dating Game

 A female CEO, who questions whether men are interested in her for her money, lies on an Internet dating application that she is merely a secretary. Meanwhile, a male nurse, who believes most women are attracted to power, success and money, lies on his application that he is a doctor. The two are matched and are instantly attracted to each other.
