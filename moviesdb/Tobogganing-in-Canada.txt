Tobogganing in Canada

 A great Canadian Winter sport. The toboggans are seen coming from over the top of the chute, which is nearly one mile long, appearing as a mere speck on the screen. As they come closer they grow and finally appear clear and distinct and life size upon the screen. They pass in rapid succession at a speed of forty miles an hour. Sold complete or in separate lengths.
