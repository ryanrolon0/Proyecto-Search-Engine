Put Some Money in the Pot

 Wally (Wally Brown) and Jack (Jack Kirkwood) are down-and-out song and dance men facing eviction from their boarding house when they decide if one of them was engaged to the landlady (Patsy Moran), they could forestall eviction. They also forestall the wedding but the woman's brother (Dick Wessel) is having none of that. Title of film comes from a catch-phrase used by Kirkwood on his radio show broadcast on the Mutual Network from 1950-53, which also had Wally Brown as a regular cast member.
