The Mourning After

 Scott Walker, a self-made, self-centered man, awakens one Saturday morning to find his wife gone. Having had an argument the night before, he is not all that concerned at first. But as the day progresses, and eerie nuances slowly manifest, Scott begins to recall more and more the very subject of their argument - widespread rumors foretelling God's coming wrath. It appears something happened during the night as people slept. And Scott Walker finds he has awakened much too late.
