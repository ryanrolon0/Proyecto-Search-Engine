The Miser's Policy

 At the death of her father, little Katy became an orphan. By the terms of the will her uncle was to receive the fortune providing he took care of the girl. This the man agreed to do, but he was influenced more by the reward than by his love for his niece. For the first years Katy was perhaps a little care, but she soon made herself indispensable by her services, and as she grew older her uncle found her presence a decided advantage. When, in time, her charming presence made her the recipient of the attentions of young men, her guardian found a pretense of some kind under which he could turn away the suitor. Ambitious young Benny, however, struck out boldly to make a success of himself, and his energy soon conquered. He wrote back to Katy that he would soon return to claim her as his wife. This letter the old man intercepted and retained - his avaricious nature was his master. A troubled conscience saw a vision of his fortune flitting away from him and he brought out his riches to gloat over it. In this attitude he was found by Katy and Benny, who had returned and demanded an explanation. They were not inclined to accept his flimsy explanations, but the pitiable old miser pleaded so earnestly for a pardon that the happiness of the young couple would feign allow them to resist his supplications.
