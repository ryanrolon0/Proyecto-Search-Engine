Regionrat

 Based on the book by author Richard Laskowski, Regionrat is the story of how an underachieving teenager struggles to make sense of his destiny, his friends, twisted love affairs, and drug use.  Ray has lived within "The Region" for most of his life, and just like other Regionrats, he feels stuck in a place he thinks he understands, chained to the mid-American subculture of survival and lifestyle from which he believes he cannot escape.
