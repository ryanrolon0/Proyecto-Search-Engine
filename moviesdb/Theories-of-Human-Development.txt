Theories of Human Development

 Professor Malcolm W. Watson introduces six theories of human development, a field that is in large part about child development, and the people who devised each theory. Sigmund Freud dealt with the unconscious conflicts that form our personalities and explained how the sex drive motivates us. Erik Erikson handled the development of our identities and of the issues of connectedness and independence. John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth theorized about the development of close relationships and how attachments form. Albert Bandura dealt with how we learn through observation and how we learn self-efficacy through manipulating our environment. Jean Piaget handled the development of our cognitive skills and characterized the child as a lone scientist. Lev Vygotsky, whose influence is mostly posthumous, saw the child as more of an apprentice and theorized about how we learn by cooperating with adults. Professor Watson examines the strengths and weaknesses of each theory and explains how each one has influenced this field of study.
