Soft

 A man gets home from work, shouts some complaints at Scott, his teen son who's upstairs, and heads to a mini-mart for a pint of milk. There he's accosted, harassed, and jeered by six youths in hooded sweatshirts, and he's punched by their leader, a budding sociopath in white. Dad walks home. The gang trails about a block behind. At home, Scott confesses he was in a fight today but didn't hit back. His father tells him that he must defend himself, then does nothing when the gang arrives in front of their home and starts hollering and throwing things. Finally dad goes outside. Is that going to be it?
