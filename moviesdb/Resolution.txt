Resolution

 The last night of the millennium and a suicidal man with a bullet in his head and vengeance on his mind makes his way up the long winding drive to a New Years party winding down...but the party has just begun as he will take them on a journey of self-discovery bringing them face to face with fate and truth. His goal they have tried to hide from it their whole lives but tonight it will hit them in the head like a sledgehammer, and the test will be, who can remain standing in the end...
