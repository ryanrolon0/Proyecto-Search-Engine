The Color of Danger

 In the first story line, a veteran undercover agent and a trainee operative attempt to infiltrate a criminal gang by kidnapping a beautiful courier and assuming her identity. Unfortunately one of the gang members knows that the agent is an impostor and the federal agents are soon bound and gagged captives. In the second tale, an applicant for a waitress position at an exclusive restaurant finds a hidden camera in the dressing room. She traces the camera to the restaurant's manager who takes the buxom blonde prisoner.
