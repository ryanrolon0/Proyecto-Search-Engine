Rand Holmes Retrospective Art Show

 Rand Holmes Retrospective Art Show Rand Holmes was Canada's most revolutionary artist in his heyday, the star cartoonist at the Georgia Straight newspaper in British Columbia during the 1970s. He spent his last 20 years on a remote island in the Straits of Georgia where he lived out his dreams of pioneering and homesteading. He died in March 2002 from Hodgkin's lymphoma and a retrospective exhibition of his original work was held five years later at the Lasqueti Island community hall.
