Super Mario World

 While Mario, Luigi and Princess are vacationing in Dinosaur Land, King Koopa shows up again and once again abducts the Princess. So Mario and Luigi, with the help of their new friend Yoshi, can soar to new heights to send Koopa and his seven kids away once and for all. Hopefully. This time, Mario can obtain a cape from a feather and soar even higher, and must stop new enemies like Chargin' Chuck, Koopa Wizard, Fishbone, and more. You must brave daring areas like Dinosaur Land, Donut Land, Chocolate Island, Mysterious Forest, Butter Bridge, Vanilla Dome, and Valley of Koopa and reach Koopa's neon castle and stop that reptile yet another time!
