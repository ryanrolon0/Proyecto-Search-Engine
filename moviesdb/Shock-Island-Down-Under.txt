Shock Island Down Under

 Follow World Champion Mike Stewart in his quest Down Under to ride the fabled Shark Island, and explore Australia. Then on to the unlikely location of Texas -- for the Flowrider wave machine at the Schlitterbahn Water Park in New Braunfels. Designed by Tom Lochtefeld, the standing barrel has to be seen to be believed.
