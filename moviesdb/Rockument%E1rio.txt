Rockumentário

 Kaló, Filipe, Calhau and AndrE personify the rock'n'roll which defines Bunnyranch, one of the most exciting rock bands in Coimbra-Portugal. With just 4 years has a group, they've recorded an EP and an album, and have performed in Spain, Holland, England and all over Portugal. They seem to be unstoppable, but something will happen which will change the band forever.
