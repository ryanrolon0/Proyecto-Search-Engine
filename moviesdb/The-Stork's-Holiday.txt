The Stork's Holiday

 The stork tells about a harrowing encounter with a gun emplacement. As a result, he declares himself "closed for the duration." His reflection in the mirror, however, gives him a pep talk, reminding him of his ancestors who flew in the previous wars. The stork sets out with homemade armor and, with the help of a cigar smoke screen and a cloud, manages to send the planes chasing him right down the barrel of the "Big Bertha" gun.
