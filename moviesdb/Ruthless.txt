Ruthless

 Years after the destruction of his Chinese gun smuggling ring, a young ambitious Triad named Lee is opening a new underground operation in a non-descriptive warehouse in a forgotten corner of the United States. But before he can set his dealings with his new American backers in stone, he discovers that more than just bad memories and a criminal record followed him across the sea.
