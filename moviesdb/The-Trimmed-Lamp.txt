The Trimmed Lamp

 Childhood friends Nancy and Lou go to New York to make their fortunes. Nancy gets a job at a Fifth Avenue shop and dreams of marrying a millionaire. Lou works in a laundry and has found Dan, a more modest suitor. Nancy is courted by millionaire Reggie Van Skittles, but soon learns that money doesn't make one a gentleman. Lou, envious of Nancy, becomes Van Skittles' mistress and drops out of sight. Nancy spends months searching for her and when they finally meet, it's obvious by Lou's appearance that she's now a kept woman. Nancy gives up her dreams of fortune and marries Dan instead.
