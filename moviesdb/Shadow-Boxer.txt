Shadow Boxer

 Larger-than-life Irish actor and writer Seamus Patrick McDonagh is a charismatic contradiction of a man with a huge infectious smile, an honors degree in English literature and a powerful left hook. Up from obscurity to become Golden Gloves champion by knocking out all his opponents, the then third-ranked cruiser weight in the world moved up to the heavyweight division in 1990. Against all odds he fought Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight championship.
