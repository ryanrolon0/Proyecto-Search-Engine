Romance on the High Seas

 Socialite Elvira Kent suspects her husband of fooling around with other women. When he announces he can't join her on their scheduled ocean voyage, she hires a nightclub singer, Georgia Garrett, to pose as her on the cruise. Elvira stays at a hotel near home so she can spy on her husband. She's unaware, however, that her husband has hired a detective, Peter Virgil, to keep an eye on her at sea. Of course, Peter doesn't realize that Georgia is not Mrs. Kent... A wife suspects her husband of having a roving eye. Her husband suspects the same about her. His business deals mean he has to cancel their anniversary vacation every year. So this year, in order to snoop on her dearly beloved, she engages a poor cabaret singer from Far Rockaway to sail alone to South America under her name, so she can stay behind and keep tabs on hubby. Meanwhile her husband is suspicious so he hires a detective to watch his "wife" on her southbound cruise. But the singer's wisecracking piano player has been pursuing her for years and he books passage too...
