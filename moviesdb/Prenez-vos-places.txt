Prenez vos places

 Shot in 30 days in Montreal, Prenez vos places is a clever, reflexive, truly indigenous comedy about the existential predicaments of young graduates facing their vague future prospects, and the joys and pitfalls of making a first feature film. As Benoit, Raphail Roussel has a natural talent for physical and vocal comedy; his foil counterpart is the handsome, gentle yet intense Nick, played by Elias Varoustos. Featuring a supportive supporting cast of promising young actresses and actors. A hilarious "making-of" nothing; a filmmaking pastiche that will leave you smiling; a coming-of-age vignette. Loft Story meets Seinfeld meets Godard
