The Last Mahout

 The Last Mahout is a unique portal into the plight of the Asian Elephants; the film explores the tragic collisions of man and beast and speaks plainly about the steps necessary to save this remarkable animal. Elephants are vulnerable to all manner of threats and need large areas of forest in the wild. Habitat loss and fragmentation threatens them throughout their range. As habitat becomes fragmented elephants come into increasing, often fatal conflict with humans and agriculture.
