Saamy

 Aaruchami (Vikram) is a Deputy Commissioner of Police of Thirunelveli who efficiently brings the city under control. At the outset, he pretends to be a corrupt cop by accepting bribes from the very influential Annachi. Later Saami starts to rebel against him and the rest is how he suceeds in expelling the corrupt politicians.
