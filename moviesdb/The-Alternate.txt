The Alternate

 For several years, the Counting Project has been working on a time travel experiments in a secret government facility overseen by the NSA. One month ago, Ally North was the first time traveler to be killed in a time jump gone wrong. Tonight, Ally's boyfriend and fellow scientist, Mitch breaks into the Counting Room after hours and makes an unauthorized and illegal time jump. Security falls short and Mitch escapes without being identified. The small group of engineers and scientists involved in the project are immediately called in and briefed by their supervisor, Plath. One thing is for certain; whoever was able to bypass security and operate the time machine is among the men standing in the room.
