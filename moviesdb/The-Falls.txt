The Falls

 In a smoke-filled dive in Buffalo, NY, David Marx tells us his tale of obsession, betrayal, and murder - leading him to an uncertain fate "underneath Niagara Falls." David tells us how his beautiful redheaded ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Barnes, has disappeared and how he ended up the guardian of the 2.5 million dollars that "was supposed to have bought Jen's safety." Three nights ago, David finds police detectives Crane and O'Keefe trashing his apartment. Taking him to Police Headquarters, they interrogate David about Jennifer's disappearance, and Crane - in the name of Jen's father, the rich and powerful Ethan Barnes - brutalizes poor David in hopes of getting a confession out of him. When falsely accused, what's a film noir hero to do but search for the truth himself?
