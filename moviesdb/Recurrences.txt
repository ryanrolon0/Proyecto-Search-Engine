Recurrences

 Peter, a psychologist, has been seeing his patient, Michael for about two years. Michael's visits have always been strictly pleasantries, opportunities to explore his interesting recurring memories. Peter and Michael quickly start to realize that the memories have a far greater effect on Michael's present day emotions than normal. Comsumed and infected by his emotions of the past, Michael cannot control his irrational and sometimes violent actions. Peter begins to fear for Michael's safety... and his own.
