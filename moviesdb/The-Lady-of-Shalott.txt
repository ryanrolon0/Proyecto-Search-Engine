The Lady of Shalott

 A young lady is cursed to only see the world as reflected in a mirror and to weave images of what she sees using her loom. Inspiration for the visual imagery comes from the many Pre-Raphaelite paintings that the poem inspired, but most especially the paintings of the artist John William Waterhouse.
