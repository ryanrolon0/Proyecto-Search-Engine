Purple Glob

 Informed by the irony of the Michael Jackson re-enactment trials, the long running and seemingly popular COPS television show, and Mike Kelley's disturbing gender swapping essay of a first person account of alien visitation. Skye Thorstenson tries to remember and re-create Mike Kelley's essay without re-reading it for a year. The final project is a funny albeit disturbing look at the problematic manner memory works.
