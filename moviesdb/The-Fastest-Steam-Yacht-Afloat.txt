The Fastest Steam Yacht Afloat

 In this picture, we show a steam yacht running at the rate of upwards of 50 miles an hour. This is not only an excellent picture of the above named subject, but is also a beautiful water scene. While showing this picture, you will notice that the yacht blows her whistle. If this effect, by artificial means, is taken care of back of the screen the picture itself will prove most effective.
