Tehran Taxi

 Iran's most popular car, which was modeled on the 1960s Hillman Hunter. The Paykan, which is driven by about 40% of Iranians is a heavy polluter. First built in 1967, the car is highly valued because of its low cost, its durability and easiness to repair. The Paykan - meaning 'arrow' in Farsi, burning fuel at 12 miles to the gallon, the car does not meet international emissions standards and its forty year old design precludes any radical technological alterations.
