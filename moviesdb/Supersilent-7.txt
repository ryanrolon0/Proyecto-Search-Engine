Supersilent 7

 7 is a concert film of the Norwegian band supersilent. Recorded in Oslo in August of 2004, it is the first video release by the band after four records (1-3, 4, 5, 6), all released on Norway's Rune Grammofon label. This is completely improvised music, sometimes very noisy, sometimes very quiet and ethereal, and always very beautiful.
