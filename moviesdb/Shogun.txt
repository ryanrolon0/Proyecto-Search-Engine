Shogun

 According to written history, 16th century Japan was torn by war. After the supreme leadership of the shogunite government collapsed, Japan split into many warring factions. The player takes on the role of one faction leader and administrates the government through war and diplomacy in a quest to end the fighting by uniting Japan under one supreme shogun. Through master-class war strategy, battlefield tactics and combat, economics, and RPG-developed monarchs and generals, the player lives history.
