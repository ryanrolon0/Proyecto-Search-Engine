Walter and the Tigers

 Free-diving & swimming with Tiger Sharks in South African waters with Walter Bernardis, an expert diver on these animals. Throughout the scuba dives he shows that Tiger Sharks are not anywhere near as aggressive or dangerous as we think and that we can dive with them safely, but also investigates the Tigers' behavior more thoroughly. Such as their varying behaviors around the bait, how they react to electromagnetic waves, or how they even see us. We're left with a deepened affection for them as well as a deepened sense of safety. But in the 2nd half, the action switches to the beach nets that kill the Sharks to protect the bathers. We learn of their painful death at the hands of the Natal Sharks Board, and their actual dissections in front of an audience by this organization. We learn how much damage is done to the Tiger Shark population in SA but also other Sharks and marine species too. Overall the film's journey takes us on an arc where our fears of Tiger Sharks are dispelled and replaced instead with a fondness but also sympathy for their own danger and survival.
