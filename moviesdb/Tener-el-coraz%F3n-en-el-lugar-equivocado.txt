Tener el corazón en el lugar equivocado

 A 17-minute short film which takes us into the world and creative process of Jose Antonio Sistiaga, an artist who paints his films by hand, frame by frame, as if each frame were a canvas. In the artist's home in Ciboure, in his small studio, we discover a world of colour on a table underneath plastic sheets. This is the beginning of some remarkable work. Unique. A magic universe that impregnates roll on roll of celluloid. The film follows carefully his path from the most intimate and private facets of his work to the screenings at La Geode Omnimax Theatre in Paris.
