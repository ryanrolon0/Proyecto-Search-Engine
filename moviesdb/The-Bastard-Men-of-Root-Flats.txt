The Bastard Men of Root Flats

 In the town of Root Flats, Arkansas, a group of vicious outlaws have taken over and have transformed the once prominent mining facility into a ghost town. With only one night left as fugitives on the run from the law, these bastard men hold in their possession $3,000,000 of stolen cash and gold.
