This England

 This British- National-Anglo American production reinforces the theme that whoever assails the land of Britain only succeeds in uniting and cementing the landowner, the peasantry and the working classes of the land. Using the threat of invasion (by the Nazis)this four-episode film covers (as best as it can in 8000 feet of celluloid) the Norman invasion; the Spanish armada; the Napoleonic Era; and the twentieth century.
