The Spanish Cape Mystery

 New York detective Ellery Queen travels to the California coast with his friend Judge Macklin for a vacation at a rented cabin. But they don't even have a chance to unpack before they become swept up in a kidnapping and murders involving the Godfrey family who live in the Spanish Cape estate nearby. As bodies drop as often as the tides, and the local police suspect everyone in the Godfrey family, Ellery comes to the rescue and solves the crimes while romancing the family's beautiful daughter Stella. Ellery Queen, a private detective from New York City, travels to California for a vacation at a resort. He immediately becomes involved in the most baffling case of his career when three members of a house-party, next to his cabin, are murdered and all of the guests are under suspicion. And an innocent woman, in which he is becoming fond of, is about to be arrested for the killings.
