The Gallows Tree

 All Lisa wants is to leave her past behind by joining a sorority. But it won't be that easy. Ali will make Lisa's last initiation as terrifying as possible...even if it means death. As Lisa begins to succumb to Ali's mind games, Heather is the only one who can help her. But will Heather choose life with the "in" crowd over death? The Gallows Tree examines human nature in a horrifying journey into the minds of three girls who will do anything to get what they want.
