Slide, Babe, Slide

 Babe Ruth gets off a train, and joins in a baseball game with some kids who refuse to believe he is the Babe until one of them produces a newspaper with his photograph. His first action is as pinch runner when one kid is called indoors by his mother. He then gives a lesson in correct sliding technique, gives some batting tips, and hits an inside-the-park homerun against a quaking pitcher before grabbing his jacket and running for the departing train.
