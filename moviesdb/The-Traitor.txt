The Traitor

 A German Jewish doctor, who is a former resistance fighter against the Nazis during the war, attends an annual reunion at the home of a former British officer. However, when he discovers that many of his former compatriots have mysteriously died, he begins to suspect that one of the "resistance" fighters may in fact have been a Nazi agent who is now trying to eliminate all the members of the unit.
