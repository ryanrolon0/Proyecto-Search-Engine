The Neon Man and Me

 It's 1989 and the deep south is buzzing with the hint of the Persian Gulf War. Two eccentric jazz musicians meet - one a Jewish piano player named Slash Coleman and the other a Pentecostal saxophonist named Mark Jamison. Fueled by a series of mysterious prophesies, a stash of dehydrated diet food and bonding over the unique rituals of music and their perspective religions, the two young musicians take a musical tour of the south and become fast friends. Slowly overwhelmed by the limitations of the south and haunted by his mother's tales of the Holocaust , Coleman embarks on a lone artistic journey. From a fisherman in Alaska to a massage therapist in Oregon to an artist in Maine, his globe trotting will take him through 134 day jobs, 117 apartments and 68 failed relationships in 8 different states in 2 different countries. All the while, Jamison, turning his creative energies toward neon, will remain his best friend in Virginia - his North Star back home. Nearly twenty years later, with their marriages turned toward divorce, the friends turn toward a collaboration that will bring Coleman back home when the unthinkable happens. Jamison is electrocuted in a freak accident, leaving Coleman more lost than ever. Looking for a sense of direction, Coleman returns home and learns the girl Jamison loved is pregnant with his child. In his effort to create a care package for Jamison's son, Coleman creates, "The Neon Man and Me" - eight monologues about friendship told by 25 characters, and an original score that Coleman plays on his guitar.
