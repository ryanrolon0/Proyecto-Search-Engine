Walk in the Light

 WALK IN THE LIGHT features Los Angeles-based Unity Fellowship Church, a politically conscious and socially aware alternative to the traditional Christian church for the African American LGBT community. Three distinct perspectives - from a former crack addict, a transgender female who becomes a grandmother, and a lesbian couple with incongruous religious backgrounds - reveal how being part of the Unity family has allowed them to replace condemnation with self-acceptance.
