Ren zhe wu di

 A young martial artist seeks revenge on the Ninja who kills his martial arts brothers and teacher. He finds help in the form of a new teacher (who knows Ninjitsu) and new brothers. Together the four pupils face the Five Element Ninja challenge Two warring clan leaders challenge each other to a tournament involving their best fighters. One clan loses heavily, and in revenge employs the services of the Five Element Ninjas, whose fighting styles are based on the five Chinese elements (gold, wood, water, fire and earth). The ninjas dutifully defeat the hitherto victorious clan and then turn on their employers. It seems as though the ninjas are set to rule the martial world - but the sole surviving member of the clans meets up with an old man who alone knows the secret of how to defeat the ninjas... Two Chinese clans compete in 10 rounds of combat using (in most cases) a vast assortment of weapons. When one clan loses heavily they employ the services of Japanese ninjas. The ninjas challenge the first clans' best fighters to face five sets of element ninjas. When the Japanese ninjas massacre the clan they follow up by invading their head quarters and wiping out the remnants of the clan. One clan member gets away and learns the art of the ninjas. He then heads back to challenge the ninjas who have now disposed of their employers. The lone clansman and his three new sworn brothers must then face the unstoppable ninjas.
