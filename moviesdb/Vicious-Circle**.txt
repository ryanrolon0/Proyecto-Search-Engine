Vicious Circle**

 " Vicious Circle " is a short/drama about suspicion and betrayal. Set in 1916 during Irelands struggle for freedom, it is paralleled with today's attempts to bring peace in Northern Ireland. Shot in black and white using original footage, it is a thought-provoking story about what happens when people wont trust each other, resulting in a continuing circle of unnecessary violence.
