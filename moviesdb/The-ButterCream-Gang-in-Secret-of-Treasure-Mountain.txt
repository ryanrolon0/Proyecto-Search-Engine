The ButterCream Gang in Secret of Treasure Mountain

 Discovering part of an ancient Spanish treasure map, young Eldon Flowers dreams of finding gold. He could be rich, and he could also help Mr. Graff who is about to lose his home. Eldon secretly hopes this valiant deed will make him the hero he longs to be. With help from the other ButterCreamers, he embarks on a quest that will lead him to a concealed crypt in an old monastery, a deep cave hidden high in a mountain, and face to face with three greedy characters who will stop at nothing to find the treasure first. Eldon must often make difficult decisions that help him discover much more than gold. He finally sees himself as others do and begins to understand what being a hero really means.
