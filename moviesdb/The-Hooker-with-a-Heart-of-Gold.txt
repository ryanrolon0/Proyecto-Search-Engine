The Hooker with a Heart of Gold

 An out of work surgeon creates a powerful prosthetic heart (made of solid gold) which he transplants into the body of a beautiful prostitute he accidentally runs over with his car. The two then find themselves on the run from her former pimp, and a team of gangsters the doctor owes money to.
