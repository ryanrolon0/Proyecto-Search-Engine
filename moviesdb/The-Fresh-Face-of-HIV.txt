The Fresh Face of HIV

 With the advent of anti-retroviral medications, people with HIV/AIDS began living longer, healthier lives and the attention paid in the US to domestic HIV/AIDS issues began to wane. But was no new good news? Three students in documentary filmmaker Niklas Vollmer's Community Based Media Project class at Georgia State University, Phoebe Brown, Collin Hicks and Marvin Evangelista investigate the realities of living with HIV/AIDS and find that the fight against HIV is far from over. Using a blend of personal narratives and clinical facts what we found was that many of the improvements in treatment come at a cost and the best hope we have right now lies in prevention.
