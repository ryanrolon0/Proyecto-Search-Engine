Sock War

 When twenty-two year old Rick is told to "spend more time" with his seventeen year old brother Stuart, fighting for the longevity of the Third Reich was the last thing he had in mind... Dragged into the middle of a poorly staged WWII reenactment, Rick not only finds himself an enemy of the American Military, but at war with Stuart himself (in multiple senses of the word)! But at the end of the day, it takes a good, hard battle to bring people together.
