Tom's Photo Finish

 Tom has a chunk of the leftover chicken just before his owner George goes to look at the fridge. He threatens to take care of whichever animal did it. Tom frames Spike the dog, but Jerry snaps a photo of him in the act, prints up dozens of copies, and then battles Tom to get George to see one of them.
