The Awkward Stage

 The Awkward Stage is the story of five "performers" who come together (by way of a Craigslist ad) to create and tour an "educational" show to elementary and middle schools all across America. And by "educational" we mean SEX educational. The film follows them as they get on the road for their first performance of "Puberty's OK with Me!"
