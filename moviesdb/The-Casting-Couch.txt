The Casting Couch

 Ron Jeremy directs and stars in this hilarious sexcapade. Masquerading as a producer, he calls agents all over town to send him their prettiest young actresses for his "casting call". Of course, in order to better their chances of getting the role, Ron's casting couch as well as his pelvis, gets worked over to the breaking point. This is a must see for fans of both Ron Jeremy and some of the sexiest sirens of their era.
