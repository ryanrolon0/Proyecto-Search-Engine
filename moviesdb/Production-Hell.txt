Production Hell

 This film is a documentary based on three location scouts, who in the summer of 2010 went missing while on location. Some time later, their footage was delivered to authorities by mail and it had been manipulated and edited into a horror film. The trio's whereabouts is still unknown. 'Production Hell' combines the original footage of the missing cast and recent interviews from investigators, witnesses and colleagues. The location footage has been contaminated with unexplained sequences, sound effects and blurs the line between fact and fiction. It is near impossible to distinguish the reality of the disturbing events that transpire.
