Valentines

 A dramatic short about a young girl's growing awareness of the powers she has - and doesn't have - Valentines is the heartbreaking story of three teenagers caught in a tangled web of sex and money. Sixteen-year-old Joey can't afford the gift his thirteen-year-old girlfriend JESS wants for Valentine's Day. His solution to this problem is to pimp her out to his fourteen-year-old best friend KYLE.
