The Nutty Date

 Delightfully plump Michelle is on a mission- she desperately wants to get married. Unfortunately, she hasn't gotten any hits on her dating website- until now, and he isn't exactly prince charming. Rodney is a nut inspector and Michelle happens to be highly allergic to nuts. After Rodney makes a move on her and pie-loving Dan intervenes to save the day, Michelle must accept that what she really needs is love and not marriage.
