The Naked Proof

 A university philosophy student long overdue on his PhD dissertation (about the proof that other people exist) stumbles home drunk to find a pregnant woman trying to get into his apartment. As she weaves in and out of his life, he tries to decide what he really wants in life arguments on existence, or a woman who may or may not really exist.
