The Case of the Baby Sitter

 Jewel thieves, operating in the guise of a Duke and a Duchess, hire the Ace Detective Agency, ran by Russ Ashton, to "baby sit" with an infant they have kidnapped and using as a blind. A rival gang of thieves dope the "detective sitter", "Harvard" Quinlan, and make off with a valuable diamond.
