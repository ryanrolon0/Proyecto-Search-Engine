Secret Butterfly

 Hortense dances on the street corner of her Paper Doll World with her Blue Paper Butterflies. A Butterfly Man flutters to her side. He offers his hand. She resists. In her blue cocoon, Hortense spins with her love, The Brute. He crushes her Blue Paper Butterflies. The Butterfly Man offers Hortense sweet release. Hortense dreams of sweet love.
