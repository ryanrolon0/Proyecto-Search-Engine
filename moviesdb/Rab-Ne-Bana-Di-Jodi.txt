Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi

 Surinder is married to Taani but there is a huge age gap between them. There is no real romance in the marriage. Then, a dance reality show called "Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi" airs and Taani wants to participate but can't because her husband is not hip and happening. She has a fear of losing, and she also fears that her friends will laugh at her. Surinder overhears her problem and decides to go in for a makeover. He watches some movies and learns to dance in order to woo his young wife. Throughout the show, Taani keeps falling in love to with this new-and-improved Surinder without once realizing that he's really her husband. Amritsar-based Surinder Sahni, employed with Punjab Power, gets married to Taani, although she does not approve of him. She remains cold and aloof, and both do not even communicate. When she expresses a desire to participate in a competition called Dancing Jodi, Surinder permits her. He then decides to win her affections by posing as a macho man named Raj Kapoor, enrolls in the same competition, gets to be her partner, and befriends her. Unfortunately, this overture fails, she ends up detesting him even more, and plans to elope with Raj without realizing that he's really her husband.
