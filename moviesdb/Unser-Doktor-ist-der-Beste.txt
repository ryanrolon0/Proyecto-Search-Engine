Unser Doktor ist der Beste

 Dr Sommer is newly appointed to the hospital, but on arrival is mistaken for the plumber. He seems quite good at this but gets into trouble from the medical chief for being late. Romantic complications arise with a nurse. In parallel, children play practical jokes on stuffy adults, making the thin plot rather mixed.
