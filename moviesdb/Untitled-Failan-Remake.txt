Untitled Failan Remake

 In Brighton Beach, a young refugee woman winds up as the 'property' of Russian mobsters, who set her up in an arranged marriage. When she dies, however, the husband she never met discovers letters that his wife-to-be wrote him and, moved by her descriptions of the treatment she endured, he sets out to avenge her death.
