The Village Barber

 Flip opens his barbershop by setting out his barber pole in the morning. When a gluttonous pig mistakes the pole for a large piece of candy and begins eating it, Flip makes a new pole of a cat's striped tail. A furry dog comes in for a trim. Flip and his associates give him a shave and a shoe shine while other patrons dance by the piano.
