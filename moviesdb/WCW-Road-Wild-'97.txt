WCW Road Wild '97

 Just one week removed from the historic 3 Hour 100th Episode of WCW Monday Nitro Spectacular, World Championship Wrestling and the New World Order head Road Wild in Sturgis, SD. This time, WCW has the wheels turning and the momentum on their side against the nWo. On the 100th Nitro, "The Total Package" Lex Luger shocked the world be defeating Hollywood Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and bringing the belt back home. When Nitro left airwaves last week, Luger and WCW were celebrating, while the nWo was in total disarray. At Road Wild, Luger will defend the belt against the man he took the belt from five days earlier, Hollywood Hogan. That wasn't the only bad news for the nWo that came out of the 100th Nitro. The financial benefactor for the nWo, Ted DiBiase, re-emerged after a brief absence but only to resign from the nWo and align himself with the Steiner Brothers. Now, the Steiners are challenging the Outsiders at Road Wild for the WCW Tag Team Championship with the Outsiders' former manager in their corner! Syxx and "Nature Boy" Ric Flair have been battling for months now, but it's time for them to finally face each other in the ring, one on one. Can Flair stand for the tradition of World Championship Wrestling and take care of the nWo punk, or will he fall victim to Syxx's Buzzkiller? Curt Hennig and Diamond Dallas Page were supposed to be partners, going into WCW Bash at the Beach, but something went wrong. Now the former teammates will battle in Sturgis. All of that action plus much more will occur in Sturgis as World Championship Wrestling presents Road Wild 1997.
