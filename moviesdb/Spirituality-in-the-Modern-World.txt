Spirituality in the Modern World

 On a fall evening in 2006, two masters of modem spirituality met at the Society for Ethical Culture in New York City to discuss Buddhism and Spirituality in the Modern World. For two days, in front of an audience of over 400 people, Ken Wilber, the bestselling author, creator of the Integral Approach and founder of the Integral Institute and Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, the 9th Throne Holder of the Traleg lineage within the Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism, discussed the many and varied spiritual possibilities available today that are founded in deep wisdom and proven practices. This unique documentary film captures the essence of their dialogue and presents a wonderful learning and meditative experience for any viewer seeking answers to the deeper spiritual questions in modern life.
