Sul Fiume

 Sul Fiume (On the River) is a story of The Tiber. Rome's river. A snapshot of a place and its environment, its nature, and of the people who make the river their home. It is a journey through the eyes of three friends. Choosing the river of Romulus and Remus as a way to connect to a world past. They sail, with an open mind, from the country through the city, to the sea. Using the river as a mirror to the modern world. Equal parts objective documentary and Twainian adventure story, Sul Fiume, Maldi's first feature, continues the wave of young Italian cinema bursting onto the international scene.
