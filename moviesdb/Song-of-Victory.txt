Song of Victory

 Three ruthless animals (a vulture, gorilla and hyena) who strongly resemble familiar figures collectively terrorize a forest of peaceful woodland animals, forcing them to submit to their whims and tortures. The rabbits, chipmunks and birds finally must join together in resisting their brutality and driving them from their midst, restoring happiness to the forest. Cute forest creatures frolic, unaware that a German vulture, Italian gorilla, and Japanese hyena have plans of world domination. The vulture makes a speech in pidgin-German, with the Gorilla "encouraging" the audience to react enthusiastically. The creatures are next forced to bring all their food to the hellish-looking cabin where the dictators live. They've had enough, and plot their counterattack. Sending in some skunks to flush the evil ones into the open, they attack with bees, porcupines, and dive-bombing birds. The dictators are finally backed up against a cliff, where they literally show their yellow streak; they go over the edge, and light returns to the forest.
