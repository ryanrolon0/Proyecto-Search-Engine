Takin' the Breaks

 This entry in Universal's series of "Name Band Musicals" , with a Universal production number of 1308 (and U-I would use that number again in 1955 on "Webb Pierce and his Wanderin' Boys" as, for some strange reason, Universal was big on recycling production numbers), features Russ Morgan and His Band, singer Judy Clark, dancer Barbara Perry and the always-welcome Dinning Sisters. Morgan and the band play while Barabra Perry dances to "Danza de Barbara", and also provide the music on songs such as "Mary Lee", "At Sundown", "Yip Yip DeHottie" and "Small Fry."
