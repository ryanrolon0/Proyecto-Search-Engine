Reach

 Reach is the story of Dominique, a young, ambitious woman trying to climb her way up the corporate ladder. But on her way to work, while her contemporaries are standing in line at Starbucks, she pays a visit to a homeless man living on the streets of Los Angeles. She'll offer the man her lunch and a moment of kindness. Unusual gesture for a stranger? Maybe.
