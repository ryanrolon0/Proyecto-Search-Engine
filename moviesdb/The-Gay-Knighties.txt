The Gay Knighties

 Jim Dandy is having a dream about a fierce ogre that is terrifying a mythical kingdom of your. Sir Archibald Cornwal Dandy, a wandering troubadour, meets the ogre on a deserted road and charms him with his lute. Later, Sir Archy serenades a beautiful princess and is thrown into the dungeon by the King for being impertinent. He plays his lute in the underground prison and the ogre bursts through the castle walls, and everybody runs for their lives, but Archy saves the day.
