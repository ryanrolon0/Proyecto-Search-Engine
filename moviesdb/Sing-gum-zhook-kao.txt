 Rolando is a down on his luck soccer coach who is having a hard time scoring. After his team lost, he's seriously in debt to a loan shark. After being given a last chance, Rolando seeks for an idea to clear his debt. Until it just hit him, an inspiration that's too good to pass up. He'll form an all girl soccer team. Containing the bustiest and cutest girls around. They're so admirable, the male teams will pay attention to them than the tournament itself.
