Untied Strangers

 Co-habitating and conversing in hopes of copulating. Wes is a struggling artist whose artistic process is tied up in processed food, and his roommate Dale has a better handle on his Wii than women. In hopes of a hookup, both meet up with the ever-hopeful Amy and her introverted sister June - also roommates. The online-initiated blind date proves an awkward outing for the four until Dale suggests they each share a story from their lives. The exercise is increasingly sardonic, mocking the lengths to which some strangers will go in hopes of becoming intertwined. Life is funniest when it's happening to someone else.
