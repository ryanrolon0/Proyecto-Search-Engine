Voices from Sofia

 Against a background of a Bulgaria heading towards economic and moral decay, Angelite Choir-Bulgarian Voices pours forth its sublime, compelling age-old music. Voices from Sofia follows a few members of that choir who, day by day, learn new rules - those of a capitalist world - and sway between gratitude and frustration as the grim reality of everyday life in Sofia alternates with the splendor and luxury of their concert tours abroad. A Balkan-Requiem in the form of a tragi-comedy.
