Special Breakfast Eggroll

 On their last night of high school life, six best friends vow to spend their spring break together. Upon getting together on their spring break, they realize that they are bored in their small suburban Connecticut hometown. To cure their boredom, they decide to (inspired after watching the movie, "The Sure Thing") go on various road trips looking for love. In some cases love means actual love, in other cases it means sex, and in one case it means losing one's virginity.
