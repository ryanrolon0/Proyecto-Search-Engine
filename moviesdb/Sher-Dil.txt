Sher Dil

 Separated from his family, consisting of his dad, Ramkumar; mom, Mayadevi, and brother, Sanjay, Allahabad-based Prakash Saxena takes to a life of crime, calls himself Shera, but continues to search for them. He subsequently finds out that the person who knows their whereabouts is a Bombay-based male by the name of Shobhraj. He re-locates to Bombay, and this is where circumstances may force him to abandon his quest, for he will not only be arrested and held in prison, but also inadvertently jeopardize the lives of his family.
