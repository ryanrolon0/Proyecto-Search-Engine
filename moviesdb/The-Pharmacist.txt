The Pharmacist

 Spencer is a narcoleptic pharmacist who's slept through a decade. The rut he's in is starting to look an awful lot like a grave. And so Spencer goes looking for excitement. He tries drug dealing, but who would have guessed? It's so boring it's funny. But that doesn't matter because before he can really get going, he meets Alice, and Alice is more than enough to keep him awake. But as is always the way with movies about girls and guns and drugs, these sorts of things always have a way of developing some very serious complications...
