The Old 1-2 Punch

 Charlie Wonder and Carlo Tucci, two hit-men in their mid 30's, are en route to collect a debt from a man named Konstatin for their boss. Yet, Charlie seems to have a new found aversion to blood (thanks to a date gone terribly wrong) and through the sordid details he reveals to Carlo, he tries to convince his partner to take care of any dirty work if this job goes sour. They make it to their destination with only a few weird run-ins with strangely behaving pedestrians and confront Konstantin regarding the debt. As expected, the job becomes violent, but with a twist. It appears that Konstantin (through powers granted him by a magical ring) is able to control the undead. Charlie, weak in the knees at first, abandons Carlo to the horde of zombies before finally leaping at Konstantin and claiming the ring for himself. The film comes to a conclusion as the two hit-men are returned to the car. Charlie, the newly established King of the Undead, calls the previously mentioned girl to try again (his fear of blood conquered) while Carlo is revealed to be a newly made zombie.
