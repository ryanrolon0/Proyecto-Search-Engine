Tweet Zoo

 Sylvester Cat joins a tour group through the City Zoo and finds Tweety Bird among the exhibits. Sylvester chases Tweety and ends up in a bear's den, a tiger-feeder's meat store, and a lion's cage. He tries to pole vault to reach Tweety in the middle of an alligator pond, only to slip into teeth-range of the beasts. Sylvester leaves the zoo, vowing to strike birds off his list, just before a cluster of birds land on his shoulders and head.
