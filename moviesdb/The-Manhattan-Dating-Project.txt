The Manhattan Dating Project

 The film documents Laura Banks, best-selling author of "Breaking the Rules Last ditch tactics for landing the man of your dreams" on a search for true love in the city. The film is mixed with a Discovery Channel-styled mockumentary with a quirky British narrator who compares Laura's mating habits to those of animals in the wild.
