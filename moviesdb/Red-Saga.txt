Red Saga

 A society torn by an intense war and conflict. The film begins and ends with a young peasant son doing a flag dance. A young boy dots golden fields with white flags to stop birds from preying on the season's harvest of palay grains. Another child creates noise by agitating tin cans filled with small stones. An unexpected transformation takes place. A vivid landscape of metaphors on contemporary Philippine politics. A poetic take on the peasant struggle and the protracted people's war in Philippine countrysides. One of the film's highlights was a minute-long scene showing a series of bloodied hands, a horrifying display of how human lives are desecrated in an unimaginable manner.
