The Morty Sessions

 Weary and fed up with the motion picture studio's insistence for a "director commentary", a hot-shot, egotistical director grabs the recording studio's elderly night watchman and asks him to take his place in front of the microphone. But the prank backfires as all the "auteurs" who also despise the director commentary process, relish the out-of-control joke and invite the clueless senior citizen to record in their place as well. This mockumentary short subject details all the events with interviews by critics from the entertainment industry and offer their thoughts on the sudden fame of its star, night watchman, Morty Tafler.
