The Nurse's Secret

 Murder mystery with a nurse (Lee Patrick) moving into a mansion after an apparent suicide to care for the old mother. The mother is kind of spooky, but so is the butler, and the girlfriend, and the doctor, and... you get the point. After the insurance policy is found, the plot becomes more interesting.
