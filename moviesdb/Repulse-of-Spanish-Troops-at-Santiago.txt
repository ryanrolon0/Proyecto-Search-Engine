Repulse of Spanish Troops at Santiago

 "Here is an exciting picture where the Spaniards are repulsed with great loss by the Volunteer Army of the United States. This is an exact reproduction of the fight as it occurred, and it inspires you to see how bravely our soldier boys drive the Spaniards from their position and shoot them down as they try to escape."
