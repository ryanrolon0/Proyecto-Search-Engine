Sunday in the Park

 It's Sunday morning in the park. The sun is shining, the children are playing, the pigeons are cooing and a man in a straw hat sits down at a table and orders a cup of coffee. Everything is just the way we want to see the world everything peaceful and quiet? Not on this particular Sunday in the park, when the animator decides to forget about the rules of perspective and logic.
