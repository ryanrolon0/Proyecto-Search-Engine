The Kid Comes Back

 After defeating a prominent, highly-ranked heavyweight fighter in convincing and sensational fashion, "Gunner" Malone hopes to get a shot at the world-champion title, but is foiled by the retirement by the fighter who holds it. Later, Russ Conway, a Texas cowboy "Gunner" has taken under his wing, becomes the leading contender for the title through the scheming of a newspaper sports writer; but Rush refuses to fight because he is in love with "Gunner's" sister, Mary, and has promised her he will quit the game---and trickery follows. The low-number PCA certificate on this film is because the film set on a Warner Brothers' shelf for two years after it was made.
