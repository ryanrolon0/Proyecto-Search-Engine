 Bori, Dóri, and Anna meet regularly at the Espresso cafe and discuss their love affairs. They all become involved with Bori's new boyfriend Gábor. The fixed camera in the cafe observes their meetings throughout the year, together with those of sundry other customers, including the "Professor" who is the local godfather.
