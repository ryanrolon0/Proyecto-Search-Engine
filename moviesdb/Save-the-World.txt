Save the World

 A documentary showcasing the final eight days in an amazing quest to lift up one family out of the chaos they are in. We have ten volunteers, eight days, a little money, and a plan to change their lives. The Cortez family of six have no toilet, no running water, the kids sleep on a dirt floor, take baths out of buckets in the back yard, and are always sick because of dirty conditions and flea bites. We are going to help them out, were going to fix it.
