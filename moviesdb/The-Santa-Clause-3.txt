The Santa Clause 3

 Now that Santa and Mrs. Claus A.K.A. Scott Calvin and Carol Calvin have the North Pole running smoothly, the Counsel of Legendary Figures has called an emergency meeting on Christmas Eve! The evil Jack Frost has been making trouble, looking to take over the holiday! So he launches a plan to sabotage the toy factory and compel Scott to invoke the little-known Escape Clause and wish he'd never become Santa! Santa's got problems Mrs. Claus is about to give birth and wants family time, and Jack Frost (tired of second billing) is on probation under Santa's supervision. Santa tries to support his wife by bringing her parents to the North Pole (to preserve the secret of Santa, they must think it's Canada). Santa also brings his ex, her husband, and their daughter Lucy. Inside the toy factory, Jack makes mischief and hatches a plan to become Santa. With Santa juggling that many snow globes, something is bound to go wrong. But if things get too difficult, Santa can always exercise his option to invoke the Escape Clause. Will he?
