The Lakeview

 The Lakeview Restaurant is vacant when Nicki and Laura enter for a late night cup of coffee. Although their hosts, James and Linda greet the girls with a smile, the girls are faced with an unexpected series of events. They discover that the Lakeview is a place where everyone is welcome, and some are welcome to stay.
