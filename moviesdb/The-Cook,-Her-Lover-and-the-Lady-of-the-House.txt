The Cook, Her Lover and the Lady of the House

 The cook seated upon the sofa in the parlor. The lady of the house is evidently out, as the cook's young man is calling. In the midst of the love making ceremonies, the madam enters and protests, but the cook soon shows that she is the boss of the house, and in the midst of the lively struggle which ensues, the young man makes an unceremonious exit.
