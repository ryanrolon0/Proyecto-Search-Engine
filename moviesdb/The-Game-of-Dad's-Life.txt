The Game of Dad's Life

 This quirky docu-drama tells the real life story of Aref Kabbara, a Lebanese American immigrant and father of two, who left his war ridden country for America, but only to find himself settling into a suburban life of solitude and daily rituals. However, one day, Aref's kids decide to pay him a visit that totally disrupts his carefully planned life, and Aref finds himself trying hopelessly to regain control. The film provides a satirical glimpse into the life of an immigrant who, like many others, had to make sacrifices to provide for his children a better life, even if that meant surrendering his own life to the chains of routine.
