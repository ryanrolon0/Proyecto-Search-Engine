Short Cut Road

 Four couples take a short cut to an annual rock festival to celebrate the last day of college when they start to encounter strange things. Something happened during the previous year's festival that the couples were unaware of and, one by one, things start to happen to them...very unpleasant things. The music will rock but the heads will roll.
