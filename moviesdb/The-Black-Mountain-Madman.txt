The Black Mountain Madman

 Since before it's founding in the late nineteen forties, the area known as the Black Mountain State Park has been shrouded in myth. When a string of unsolved disappearances started in the early nineteen eighties and continued into this very decade a local legend was born. It's this local legend that brings five ill-fated friends to the Black Mountain State Park. Disbelieving the legend as a story told over a beer by the locals (but still curious as to whether or not it's authentic) Jeff and his best friend Eddy decide to relive their childhood of scary stories told around the campfire with three of their best friends in the very woods where the legend was born. Their trip turns into their worst nightmare when they realize that the legend is not just a story.
