Red Dog. Scooter. Applesauce.

 Martin decides to take a trip to see his childhood friend, Giggs, in Tahoe. His vacation is interrupted by an unexpected travel partner, Annie. Martin discovers his old buddy is definitely not the guy he once knew, he's now a spy, working for who knows who. To make matters worse, Martin's new friend, Annie, wants to be more than a friend. Martin must decide which is more dangerous intimidating Italian man (and his poodle), a Cuban intelligence agent (the OTHER CIA) with a Japanese accent, and two members of the CIA that may really be MIA from the FBI. RED DOG. SCOOTER. APPLESAUCE. are code words for "somewhere between THE IN-LAWSand GROSSE POINT BLANK."
