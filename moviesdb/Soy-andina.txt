Soy andina

 Two New Yorkers journey to Peru to reconnect with roots and dance. Folk dancer NElida Silva returns to her Andean birthplace to host the patron saint festival. Modern dancer Cynthia Paniagua embarks on her own journey after meeting Neli - determined to "quench a burning desire to know the real Peru, and unearth the mystery of the dances." Soy Andina is a story about crossing cultures and affirming identity in a globalized world.
