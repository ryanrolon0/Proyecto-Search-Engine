Senior Trip

 While on detention, a group of misfits and slackers have to write a letter to the President explaining what is wrong with the education system. There is only one problem, the President loves it! Hence, the group must travel to Washington to meet the Main Man. At Fairmont High School in Columbus, Ohio, a debauched group of kids rule over the school, led by stoners Mark 'Dags' D'agastino and Reggie Barry, who preach partying over education. When Dags and Reggie, along with a small assorted group of kids are caught cutting school and throwing a house party in the whinny and incompetent Principal Moss' house, they are put into detention where they are asked to write a letter to the President of the USA on the problems with education. Yet, only the school 'braniac' Lisa Perkins writes it and mails it where it's a hit with the President who invites them to Washington on a field trip to speak against education reforms. With Principal Moss and the new keyboarding teacher, Miss Milford, chaperoning them, Dags and Reggie, along with Lisa, shy stoner Wanda, school tramp Carla, king geek Virus, biker chick Meg, quiet poet Herbert, narc Steve, and the 'stupid fat kid' Miosky, take a eventual bus trip to Washington... if they can ever get there.
