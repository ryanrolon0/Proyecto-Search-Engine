Scenes at the Zoo

 After a procession of elephants, camels, etc., the wild beasts are shown in cages. Lions, tigers, hyenas, antelope, jaguars, etc., follow in rapid succession. In one cage is seen a lion and sheep, and in another a ferocious lion endeavoring to get at one of the keepers, who is teasing him with a stick.
