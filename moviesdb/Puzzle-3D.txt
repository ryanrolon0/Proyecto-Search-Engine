Puzzle 3D

 The old Romanesco realizes something is missing from his collection. He journeys through the deepest recesses of his memory to find it. The film Puzzle reunites us with the melancholic figure from Cantor Dust Man, Sebastien Loghman's prior film. Have the intervening years endowed Romanesco with power over his memories?
