Troops Need You

 The story of the wedding of Army Specialist Josh Kerber, who lost his left arm to a rocket-propelled grenade attack while serving in Afghanistan, and his long-time sweetheart, Katie. Organized by Troops Need You, a national military support charity, the wedding takes place in the chapel at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington DC. An army of civilian supporters--called Battle Buddies--provide everything from flowers to hair and nail salon treatments, professional photography, airfare for the best man (who introduced the bride and groom), a reception dinner for the entire wedding party and, of course, a beautiful dress. Watch how everyday Americans are going beyond bumper stickers and care packages to make a real difference in the lives of America's healing warriors!
