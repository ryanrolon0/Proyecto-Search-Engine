Silver City Kid

 Molybdenum deposits can make a man rich, but Stoner finds that the deposits run under the Clayton Ranch. Judge Ballard wants the Ranch so he has Garvey shoot Steve. When Ruth blames Stoner for the death of Steve, Ballard shoots Stoner and puts the blame on Ruth, who is holding the gun. This way, Ballard has no partners. While Garvey tries to shoot Jack over and over, Jack is looking for evidence to clear Ruth and convict Ballard. In 1885, a valuable mineral deposit is discovered in the Redwood Mine, owned by banker William Stoner ('Frank Jaquet' (qv)). The National Steel Company signs a contract to pay Stoner a huge sum for the mine's output. Stoner's attorney, Sam Ballard ('Harry Woods (I)' (qv)), is a respected citizen, but secretly a greedy crook. He becomes Stoner's silent partner, driving the banker to ruthless extremes. When they find that the mineral vein extends under the ranch of Steve Clayton ('Lane Chandler' (q)), Ballard has Clayton murdered to keep him from learning the truth. Clayon is survived by his sister, Ruth ('Peggy Stewart' (qv)), and a young daughter, Twinkle ('Twinkle Watts' (qv)). Jack Adams ('Allan Lane (I)' (qv)), ranch foreman for Clayton, sets out to find Clayton's killer, while protecting Ruth and Twinkle from having their property taken over by the crooks.
