Tosca

 While attending a production of Puccini's opera, Tosca, Michael gets the sense that something is not right between him and his wife, Ellie...something he can't quite put his finger on. Could she be interested in the famous-and very handsome-tenor Raymond Benjamin? When Michael finds that their disconnect is still present at intermission, he confronts her about it. As soon as he asks, however, Ellie brushes him off, and goes back to admiring Raymond Benjamin's biography in the program. Michael can't help but become more suspicions of his wife's affections for the man, but tries to remain calm as he heads back into the theater as the intermission comes to an end. The house lights dim and a hush comes over the audience as the conductor prepares to make an announcement. The seat next to Michael however sits empty, however shocked crowd that their beloved tenor, Raymond has suddenly taken ill and will not be performing any more tonight. Too suspicious to just sit still, Michael decides he must take action. Sneaking through the backstage of the opera house, Puccini's music pulses through the hallways, echoing down the corridors, and through the dressing rooms as Michael tries to find his wife and confront her about his suspicions-all the while having to avoid detection by the backstage security guards who are looking to throw him out. For a night that had started so pleasantly for Michael, it quickly becomes an affair he will never forget.
