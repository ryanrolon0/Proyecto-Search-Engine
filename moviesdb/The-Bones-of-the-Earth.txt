The Bones of the Earth

 A former U.S. Special Forces soldier framed for the mass destruction of a village in Afghanistan returns to his homeland in Scotland. Here he plots revenge on his former commanding officer, who is participating in the Highland Cull, in which rich people get to shoot deers and have their heads as souvenirs. Things fall apart when the leading man gets blamed for another incident and finds himself being hunted by a group of deer hunters.
