Une femme en Afrique

 A man invites a woman to share his room in a hostel in Djibouti because she seems to have some problems. Gradually he falls in love with her. They embark on a trip to the towns in the desert and, on the way, they learn more about each other. The man never appears on screen, so the camera becomes his point of view. A French drama romance is the highest sense, this film opens on a sad note with the only real character that we see and really focus on in the film, the woman; we are told that she has just been made homeless by her lover who has abandoned her by not showing up to a hotel rendezvous they had plan. Instead, she finds a strange man in the hotel room that her lover said he would meet her in; the man, who we never see, invites her in. Once inside, he begins using his camera to document her every mood and move. So they are on the road together, the camera still rolling. After the inevitable sexual encounter, the m,an plunges into despair, he has lost his ideal. Eventually the woman gets tired of his filming antics and denounces him, calling all manner of names to disparage his "performance" both as a film maker and as a sexual partner.
