The Lifestyle

 Oberon and Tatiana have developed a reputation throughout Los Angeles for throwing the best swinging parties. A happily married couple for years, 'the gurus' have made it their mission to share swinging with other couples. In order to spread their message, they enlist the help of a documentary filmmaker to capture 'the lifestyle' at their most recent party. Oberon and Tatiana invite their close friends, 'The Porn Stars', to help with the festivities. Heeding their therapists advice, 'the Yuppies' join the veterans for the first time. Attending yet another swinging party, 'The Dabblers' discover that today they actually like each other. Last to arrive and new to L.A., 'the Lone Stars' find themselves rapped up in the pursuit of a dream. With five couples in a house with no rules, anything can happen... and it does.
