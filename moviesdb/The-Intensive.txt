The Intensive

 Adrian Pallo is a promising writer whose screenplay was acquired for an Independent film starring his wife, Suzanne Pallo. The film's director and Suzanne's proclaimed emotional visionary, Maxwell Halliday is married to a well-known workshop director/actress, Galena Votros. Suzanne is critical of Adrian's inability to break free of what she calls his "conservative tendencies." Adrian's reluctance to explore and expand his main character's innate demons and conflicts through visual, sexual resolution is stifling his re-write of the big seduction scene; squandering an opportunity to establish himself as a viable contemporary risk-taker; and limiting Suzanne's character arc. Maxwell's insistence that the re-write is the natural and necessary progression for Suzanne's character journey has added to her turbulent relationship with Adrian. She insists Adrian take Galena's radically progressive "Intensive"Acting Workshop. Adrian reluctantly agrees to take the workshop and quickly learns that looking deeply into one's inhibitions brings to focus his true desires and direction.
