Under Snön

 Trapped in a mundane nine-to-five job, Johan turns to literature to escape the conformity and lutheran work-ethics as well as the long and gloomy Swedish winter. When Johan is caught reading in his office he faces the harsh disapproval of his colleagues. Will Hemingway be able to turn the situation around? Or will Johan be unable to reach the minds of his colleagues?
