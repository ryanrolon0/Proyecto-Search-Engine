Shanda

 A documentary about the life and music of Oliver "Tuku" Mtukudzi from Zimbabwe. The film follows Tuku on a tour of his country and into his past, through a series of concerts and interviews filmed around Zimbabwe, as he performs the songs that were most pivotal to his career. Tuku and his band "The Black Spirits" are captured performing at a most remarkable time of their long history together, and the energy of their music and dance explodes from the screen as Tuku sings the songs that mean most to him, in the places closest to his heart.
