The Condor, the Coyote and the Canyon

 The Condor, The Coyote and The Canyon takes a detailed look at two very creatures, the California Condor and the Coyote, and compares how they are viewed and treated by man. The former is mollycoddled to aid recovery from near disappearance whilst the latter is shot, trapped and hunted without mercy. The California Condor was pushed to the very limits of species survival by the advance of mankind across the USA. At its lowest point the population saw just 13 individuals remaining in the wild. Meanwhile the Coyote, once only occupying the central, southern states of America, has spread to all the lower 48 despite constant harassment from man. Through the efforts of The Peregrine Fund the condor has been brought back from the edge of extinction. Millions of dollars have been spent on this effort and the bird has become a symbol of conservation with the US. Meanwhile the coyote dwells under the heading of 'vermin' and the paradox here is that equal millions are spent on its destruction.
