The Mean Bean

 The Mean Bean centers around two mid..erm...late 20 something ladies looking for love, fun and a job that pays more than minimum wage in Miami, Florida. Penelope Smart, the tiara wearin' southern-friend pageant queen and her no-nonsense, ex-80s songstress best friend Allison Gibsonberg work at the local coffee bar 'The Mean Bean', where their ridiculous shenanigans tend to unfold. These two ladies are joined by Chow Silverberg (a half Asian/half Jewish mobile DJ) and Chad Bean (the heir to the Mean Bean coffee franchise..who is a bit light in his Gucci loafer) on a raucous adventure that takes them out of their barista stations and into the high society of Miami Beach!
