Sonho de Verão

 A writer starts a journey in search for the inspiration for he's next book. This quest takes him to the boundaries of he's own perception of reality, where the characters are ghosts that wonder through dreams. In this alternative world where fiction confuses itself with reality, the author plays the role of a character in a script bigger than life... or so it seems.
