Signs of the Times

 Jesus uses the parables of the King's Wedding feast" and the "Thief in the Night" to teach his disciples to have humility, to repent, and to be prepared for the day He will come again. Jesus teaches his followers to patiently watch for the significant signs that will precede His Second Coming.
