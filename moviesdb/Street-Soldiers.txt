Street Soldiers

 Street Soldiers follows the journey of several young men trying to change their lives and their community for the better. Without exploiting violence, the film provides information for families and community leaders to better understand what life is like for our young people who live in the urban neighborhoods of Boston. Three summers ago a thousand shootings were recorded in the inner city of Boston, Massachusetts. Many young lives were lost. Echoes of despair reverberated throughout the young and old generations. Now the story, Street Soldiers, is about regret, anger and redemption, a story that deals with the issues of depression, parenthood, immigration, childhood and street violence. Street Soldiers is a bold and honest look at a community in crisis by those who put it there.
