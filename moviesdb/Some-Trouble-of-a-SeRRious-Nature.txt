Some Trouble of a SeRRious Nature

 Based on the famous 1947 hoax letter written to Vought Aviation in which thousands of copies have since been distributed. Some Trouble of a SeRRious Nature is the hysterical tale of the last day of World War 2, one unfortunate Chance Vought F4U Corsair fighter plane, and the hillbillies' who are determined to fly it.
