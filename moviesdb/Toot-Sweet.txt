Toot Sweet

 This "Broadway Brevity" (Vitaphone production number 3025) 20-minute fictional musical-comedy stars Fifi D'Orsay doing whatever Fifi D'Orsay usually did and Rufe Davis, mostly doing his sound-effects and animal imitations and corn-pone jokes. Lester Cole and His Orchestra provide the needed music for Georgia Hayes, and a tossed in dance-team and a pair of comedy acrobats.
