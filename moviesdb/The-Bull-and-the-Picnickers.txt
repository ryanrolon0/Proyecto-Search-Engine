The Bull and the Picnickers

 Three girls and two young men are sitting under a large tree enjoying a picnic. A large black and white bull comes in sight. The girls jump up and climb a fence, and in doing so there is a great display of hosiery. One of the men endeavor to chase the bull away and is knocked down three times before he gives up and jumps the fence. The bull does a dance and Happy Hooligan an Gloomy Gus come from the inside of the bull and make short work of the dinner.
