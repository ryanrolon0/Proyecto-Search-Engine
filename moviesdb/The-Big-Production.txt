The Big Production

 Bryce does everything big, especially when it comes to impressing his longtime girlfriend, Laura. On the night he plans to pop the question, he enlists the talents of his three closest friends. But when the engagement ring goes missing, the perfect evening becomes the perfect crime. Bryce's friends are the only witnesses... and the prime suspects. Each tells his version of the evening's events quite differently - as a sitcom, a musical, an arthouse film, and more. Bryce must piece together the wildly divergent stories to find the ring and finish his biggest production yet.
