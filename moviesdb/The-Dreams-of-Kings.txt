The Dreams of Kings

 This film is a musical medieval fantasy about fighting for the crown, rising from the dead, and the victory of artistic vision over brute force. Seventeenth century songs reinterpreted by musical theatre star Keith Jack express the characters' emotions and desires. The overall style of the characters is a fusion of bird like features and late medieval costumes that are designed to express each character's personality.
