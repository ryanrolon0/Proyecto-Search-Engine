Terminated

 A film revolving around the firing of Gerhard - half of the film is happening in backwards motion though. After we see him getting fired, time starts going forward and everything happens over again - but destiny takes a different course this time, which tragically reunites him with his Ex-boss through outstanding humanity and forgiveness.
