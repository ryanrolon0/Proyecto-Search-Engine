The Professional Idiot

 Based around the life of Joseph Reedman; the ultimate self-assured geek/idiot. His overbearing but endearing confidence enables him to plod through life with precision and perfection, inspiring his best friend, office dork Bernard and loyal colleague Silvia. Yet he is missing one key ingredient in his life, a Mrs. Joseph Reedman... and despite all his efforts Joseph can't quite figure out how to make that happen with finesse. What doesn't help Joseph's aspirations is the lack of encouragement and misguidance he receives from his miserable father, Keith. Despite the love that he has for his son, Keith is one grumpy old man who is bent on discouraging Joseph's romantic pursuits. Suddenly Joseph's one and only brother, Liam - the suave black sheep of the family, turns up on Joseph's doorstep after witnessing a murder. Initially Joseph is reluctant to help Liam out, knowing that their father would go ballistic if he helps Liam, yet he risks being ostracized when he realizes that Liam may be able to help him attain the ultimate prize. Liam has always had a knack with the ladies and Joseph sees the potential of Liam being his ticket to 'girlfriend nirvana'. Joseph agrees to help his brother in exchange for help in picking up the woman of his dreams, the office hottie Sophie. The two brothers pair up to achieve their respective goals; however they run into a wave of unexpected and silly problems.
