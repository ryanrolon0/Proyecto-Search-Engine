The Last Summer of Youth

 This independent film is an intimate multi-character drama about loneliness and forgiveness. Stuck in the monotony of daily life in suburban Illinois, six different people intersect in ways they can't even see throughout the course of a summer. An old theater manager. Two college roommates. A night-shift janitor. A beautiful young female journalist. In their attempts to find happiness, these people create prisons for themselves with their secrets and lies. By the end of the summer, none of them will ever be the same.
