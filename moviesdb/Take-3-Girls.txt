Take 3 Girls

 TAKE 3 GIRLS is about the triumph of courage and hope over urban desolation and emotional loss. London's multi-cultural street music youth scene is the setting. The three main characters share a dream lives through music. Lyla is a beautiful Indian girl with a voice like an angel; Patsy a tough talking DJ; Spot a talented rapper with a dark secret. The three find an unlikely way out of the ghetto through a chance encounter with Mo, a failed Indian businessman on the edge, and his wife Romila, still grieving the death of their daughter eight years ago. The girls' attempts to transform a derelict warehouse into an unofficial music venue give Mo an idea that could be everyone's salvation.
