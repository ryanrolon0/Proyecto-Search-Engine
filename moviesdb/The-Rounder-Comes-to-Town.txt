The Rounder Comes to Town

 An Okie Gothic film based on a traditional song dating back to 1720. Throughout time the music has changed in the hands of it's performer, while the story remained largely the same. A lone drifter with no history meets the young and beautiful wife of the most powerful man in town. With a dangerous path laid out before each of them, our characters hurtle towards their destinies with no regard for the inevitable outcome. The Rounder Comes to Town is a story of deception, lust and greed...A tale as old as time itself.
