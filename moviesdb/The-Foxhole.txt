The Foxhole

 Christopher Jackson, a Black soldier in an all black regiment in World War II, knows his role in the war. What he cannot figure out is Artie, an inept white soldier, that has been added to his regiment. While on patrol the platoon is scattered by a bombing raid and Christopher finds himself in debt to Artie for saving his life. While they are 'holed up' together Christopher will find out what circumstances brought Artie to be the only white soldier in an all black regiment as well as how Artie's saving him was no accident. A bond is formed and promises are made between strangers that will never be forgotten.
