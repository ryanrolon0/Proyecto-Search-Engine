Sacred Harbor

 Sacred Harbor is a documentary about the diversity of religious life on the New York City waterfront. On beaches, ports and riverfronts, the camera observes rituals that evoke meditations on water as a life-giving source, a carrier of messages and as a metaphor for life's journey. Through compelling images, the film offers an experiential way to learn about the diverse religious communities, ideas and practices in New York City.
