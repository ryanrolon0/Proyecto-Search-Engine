Under the Shedding Chestnut Tree

 With a background recital of "The Village Blacksmith" this cartoons as Peter Pelican as a blacksmith trying to shoe a horse. Nuts from a chestnut tree keep falling through a hole in the roof and this annoys Petey so much that he places a can of dynamite under the tree with the intention of blowing it up. After the explosion, the chestnut tree is still standing but Petey's blacksmith shop is ancient history.
