Silent But Deadly 3

 The story of Silent But Deadly is quite simple. George Lucas decides he's had enough of plot-revealing Star Wars fan Web sites. He dispatches his most crafty enforcers, a pair of no-nonsense Imperial Stormtroopers (well, there's quite a bit of nonsense actually), to eliminate the Webmasters of those sites. In Silent But Deadly 2, the troopers are summoned from a seaside vacation to neutralize the latest threat on a rampage after waiting in too many Star Wars lines. Silent But Deadly 3 combines characters from the first two and concludes the trilogy in a grand fashion.
