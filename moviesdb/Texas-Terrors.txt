Texas Terrors

 When John Millbourne strikes gold, Blake and his two cronies Bennett and Ashley murder him. His son Bob, now grown and a Lawyer, plans to avenge the death. He organizes the miners and with unexpected help from Bennett's daughter Jane, goes after Blake in court. In a remake of John Wayne's 1936 "King of the Pecos", the parents of young Bob Millbourne are killed by a gang headed by Blake for their gold claim. Bob,before his father dies, promises him he will depend on the law and not resort to gun play for justice. A few years later, the grown-up Bob Millbourne, returns as a lawyer, using the assumed name of Robert Mills, and finds that Blake is now a respected "pillar" of the town, though he is still the same crooked thief and killer he was in the past. Blake is forcing the miners to bring their gold to his mill for stamping, pays them with a check that can only be cashed at his general store at a discount. Bob goes to court to stop this practice but that fails when Blake's men intimidate the witnesses and they refuse to testify. His problems are increased by the fact that Jane Bennett, the girl he loves, is the daughter of Judge Bennett, who flagrantly winks at the racket of Blake and his henchmen. When Bob advises the miners to take their gold to another mill, Blake claims that the miners have broken their contract and that he is entitled to seize their mining properties on which he holds mortgages. Judge Bennett finally awakens to the brutality and ruthlessness of the Blake gang, and acquaints Bob with a statute that states that mining claims in the locality are illegal when over a certain size, and that Blake has no right to seize through forfeited mortgages land which has no legal standing. A race now ensues between the miners and the Blake faction to reclaim the land.
