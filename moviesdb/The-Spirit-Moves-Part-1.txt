The Spirit Moves Part 1

 Part 1 of 3 DVDs, this rare cultural treasure is the most extensive video encyclopedia of African American Social Dance from 1900 to the 1980s. THE SPIRIT MOVES traces the evolution of African American dance in urban America. DVD Preview The chronicle of these 20th century dance fads is essential for dance and music research, as well as for the exploration of our social and cultural history. Shown with its original editing, this DVD contains the only footage of this kind still in existence. It was recorded and created over a period of thirty years by Mura Dehn, a European filmmaker who recognized and recorded the vital contribution of African American dance to the Jazz scene and thus, to our cultural heritage. THE SPIRIT MOVES is a rare and vital social document providing a living record of the men and women who forged American social dance styles into an improvisational art form. Previously, it was only available for viewing at the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library, or on VHS to a select group of swing dance aficionados. THE SPIRIT MOVES is such an important archive that Dancetime Publications is now making it available to libraries, schools, dance aficionados, and scholars throughout the United States and across the globe.
