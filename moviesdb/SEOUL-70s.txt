SEOUL 70s

 In the aftermath of the Korean War, South Korea grew from being one of the world's poorest countries to one of the richest. This phenomenon has been referred to as the "Miracle of Han River." After the military coup of 1961, the country descended into authoritarianism. 'SEOUL '70s Widows and Witnesses' is a story of South Korea, my home country, its cold war, and two Americans, Rev. George Ogle and Father James Sinnott, who witnessed its actual cost, the murder of eight innocent Koreans by their own government under the backdrop of the cold war.
