Umpa

 Dialogue and songs are all in rhyme (including one identical song), in the manner of later Columbia film "The Women Haters." Jack Osterman is smitten with a woman on a park bench, and cannot stop saying the word "Umpa" for the rest of the film, which involves his treatment by a doctor and his singing and dancing temptress nurses.
