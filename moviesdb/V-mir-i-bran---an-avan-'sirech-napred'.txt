V mir i bran - an avan 'sirech napred'

 This film is one of a series of AAVC films about the NATO armed forces, seen through the eyes of a Bulgarian. He does not aim at describing the technical and organizational might of the Belgian Fleet, but tries to measure the striving toward the combat effectiveness with the measure of humaneness. Are those concepts compatible at all?
