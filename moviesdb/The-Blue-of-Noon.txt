The Blue of Noon

 The Blue of Noon is the story of Yu, a woman in her late twenties trapped in a miserable town in the Utah-Nevada border. Yu Tsun will use the power of isolation of the place and its violent past to drag all possible bystanders into a trip of self-reconstruction, including a young group of glam rock hipsters, a cult of environmental fanatics, RV-driving retirees on the gateway of death, desert scuba divers, cripples in need of extreme physical and psychological therapy and a group of beautiful sad women that work the strip club at the strip mall for war vets and salt workers.
