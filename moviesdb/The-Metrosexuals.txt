The Metrosexuals

 When best friends and actors Mark and Daniel move to L.A., they think they will become the next "Matt and Ben." Instead, Daniel immediately gets work as a dog food pitch man, garnering success and a new girlfriend, and Mark can't get arrested. When Daniel's bitchy actress girlfriend tells Daniel to dump Mark so that she can move in, Mark is bereft. However, Daniel comes up with a plan that solves the problem, but might leave relationships little room for maneuvering.
