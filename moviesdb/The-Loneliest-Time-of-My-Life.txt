The Loneliest Time of My Life

 'Man' becomes obsessed with a single idea - the image of the elusive 'Blonde.' He continually questions her origin - is she memory, reality or illusion? 'Man' begins a photographic journal to trace and capture her history and beginnings. His obsession unhinges him from reality, and takes us on a heartbreaking journey through nostalgic landscapes and haunting seaside memories... A place where contradicting sight and sound are controlled by a carny 'Emcee' who pulls the strings of us all.
