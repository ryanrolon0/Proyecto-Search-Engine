Vacant Lot

 Set on the southside of Chicago, Vacant Lot unveils an urban odyssey about finding that fragile balance between life, love, and happiness. Polaris Crumble (John Milton Davis), a talented, confused, young jazz musician and his father, W.C. Crumble (Rhomeyn Johnson), a deeply troubled, former great jazz musician live in a brownstone across the street from an empty, lonely Vacant Lot. This structure has indirectly affected the lives of the residents within it's block. Most notably, Polaris, who has grown to view his life in direct correlation with the melancholy Vacant Lot. By mere coincidence, Polaris meets a beautiful young law student, Lark Medley (Michole White), during his ritualistic pilgrimage to a north side cafe. The two begin a relationship setting into motion an introspective cycle of self-realization, forcing him to examine his already unbalanced life. Haunted by uneventful sequences of the past, Polaris pours a remarkable tale of what he's seen, where he's been, and where he's going.
