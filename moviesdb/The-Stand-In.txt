The Stand-In

 With a promising career ahead of him, his beautiful girlfriend, Jennifer, and a loving family, Brian Roberts has it all...or so he thinks. But when a college professor convinces Brian to follow his dream of becoming an actor, he risks everything and heads to New York. However, Brian soon realizes that making it in show business is a lot harder than it looks and it's anyone's guess if he will become a big "movie star" or merely "the stand-in".
