The Outlaw Deputy

 Ex-outlaw Tim Mallory is looking for the killer of his friend Chuck. Having thwarted a robbery attempt by one of his old gang members he is made a Deputy. He finds Houger who he believes is the killer and starts cleaning up his town. When an old gang member arrives and exposes him, he is arrested. But before being taken to jail, he sees Houger is wearing Chuck's watch. Tim Malloy (Tim McCoy) turned outlaw to right a great wrong. After that purpose has been attained, another task awaits him---the avenging of the murder of his young friend Chuck Adams (George Offerman, Jr. billed as he always was.) The trail leads Tim to Goldland which is ruled by gamblers and bandits and has a useless sheriff. Mine owner Rutledge (Joseph Girard) has Tim appointed a deputy to enforce the law. Tim defies Howger (Hooper Atchley), boss of Goldland, at the saloon headquarters of the gang, and his gun barks death to the henchmen sent to get him. Joyce Rutledge (Nora Lane) is fascinated, but fears Tim, whom she thinks is too ruthless in his methods. Her opinion changes when she sees him, outnumbered, disperse Howger's henchmen, when they disrupt a church service. Cash (Bud Osborne), an old enemy, who is aware of Tim's outlaw past, reveals it to Howager. Tim admits the truth to Howager's accusations and is jailed. Joyce goes to the jail at night and frees him. In the final reckoning, Tim shoots down Howger, whom he identifies as the killer of Chuck as he is carrying Chuck's watch which was taken off his body. Mission accomplished, Tim is about to ride away...maybe.
