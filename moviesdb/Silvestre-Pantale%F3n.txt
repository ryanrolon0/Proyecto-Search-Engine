Silvestre Pantaleón

 The story of an elderly man from the Nahuatl-speaking village of San Agustin Oapan, Guerrero, Mexico. Told with a lyrical combination of lingering imagery and ethnographic detail, 'Silvestre Pantaleon' follows the protagonist as he struggles to pay for a curing ceremony and provide for his family. He dedicates himself to the only remunerative activities he knows household objects that he alone still has the skills to produce. 'Silvestre Pantaleon' is a simple though universal tale of aging. It suggests both triumph (the household provided for and health recovered--through offerings to the hearth, the earth, the river, and the deceased) and reversal (the recognition that healing is but an ephemeral hiatus in the inexorable advance of time).
