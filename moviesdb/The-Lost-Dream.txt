The Lost Dream

 Petunia the housekeeper warns Little Audrey not to read by moonlight. Doing so causes bad dreams. Audrey doesn't believe it. When she goes to sleep, she has a dream about a land of candy. Nothing bad about that. The dream suddenly personifies, becoming a little boy who identifies himself as a lost dream. He's lost because he missed the dream boat, which takes all the dreams back to Dream Land. Audrey offers to help him find his way home. In no time, they're in Dream Land, where Audrey meets its ruler, the Sandman. The Sandman agrees to allow the little dream-boy to show Audrey around. But he warns him against going near the Black Door. The dream-boy listens, but Audrey is far too curious to keep clear of it.
