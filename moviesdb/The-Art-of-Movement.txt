The Art of Movement

 This lesson is simple, the reason men fight is because they are insecure, one man trying to prove he is stronger, but the highest level you can achieve ...is when you are able to walk away without using force. A man so strong on the inside has no need to demonstrate his power, if you can do this you will never lose.
