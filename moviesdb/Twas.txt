Twas

 It's Christmas Eve in Compton and down-n-out dad; Darryl Blueberry has just stopped two thugs from mugging a man dressed in a Santa suit. While he is waiting for the police arrive, Darryl notices that the bag of this "department store Santa" is filled with toys. Darryl decides to take the bag as a reward for saving his life. Now his dilemma of not having gifts for his 10-year-old son Jioni is over but what Darryl doesn't know, is that he actually stole the bag of the real Santa Claus! Due to the mugging and the loss of his magical bag, Ole Saint Nick is unable to finish his Christmas deliveries and has no choice but to track down Darryl. Once Darryl realizes the mess he has caused, Santa prescribes a compromising cure for this Yule Time predicament area rounds -- and do so during the Festival of Kwanzaa. Darryl's life, however, goes from bad to worse after he takes the reigns as Santa's alter-ego "Kwanzaa Klaus" and attempts to turn Kwanzaa into a second Christmas. With the final day of the Festival nearing, Darryl risks the loss of his family as he fights the clock to reverse his holiday missteps and remind everyone of the true meaning of Kwanzaa.
