Seasin's Greetinks!

 Popeye skates over to Olive's house to give her a Christmas present skates of her own. While he's teaching her, Bluto skates up and gets fresh; of course, Popeye fights him. When she rejects Bluto again, he sends her careening on an ice floe towards a waterfall. It's Christmas Day, and Popeye has bought Olive Oyl a pair of ice skates. When the two lovebirds go out to the river to try them out, Bluto shows up and makes yet another pass at Olive. When she refuses him, he cuts away the ice at the brink of a waterfall, and Olive finds herself hanging precariously from a ledge over the falls, and Popeye must save her.
