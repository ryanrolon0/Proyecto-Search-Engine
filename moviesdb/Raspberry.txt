Raspberry

 Stephanie Brait plays Moira, is a young artist, still living at home, finishing college and deciding her priorities for the future. Through a video dream-journal, she recalls identity-shaping parts of her past that have been manipulated by either memory or dream logic. She has trouble connecting to her family and the outside world, and she feels trapped inside her narrow experience of life. This is a surreal story of self-critique and self-discovery.
