 Eleanor Moseley plays Catherine Kenyon in an emotionally charged drama co-starring John Fantasia and Ryan Cooper. Catherine, recently remarried, is still tied down by years of emotional abuse from her ex-husband Vincent Arsenault (Fantasia), a quick witted but temperamental university professor. When their ideologically radical daughter disappears and is suspected of being involved in terrorist activities, Vincent and Catherine are forced to meet to assist in the search for their daughter. Reminded of the emotional vulnerability she still suffers from under the grip of Vincent, Catherine decides to take things into her own hands and find closure within herself, using her strength of character to overcome her timidity and eliminate once and for all the last thing standing between her and happiness- the power held over her by Vincent Arsenault.
