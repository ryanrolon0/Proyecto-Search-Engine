The Devonshire Fair

 This is rather a complete Midway of some great exposition, and is the only film we know of that shows so many different varieties of merry-go-rounds and scenic railways, beside the thousands of persons who have congregated there to witness and take part in the sights. It is a film that will please the masses, decidedly interesting from start to finish.
