Sikhs@War

 Jaspal Singh, a teenager from Coventry, UK who goes on a journey to discover and narrate the forgotten history of the 100,000 Sikhs who fought and died for Great Britain during the Great War. Seeing and learning about the battlefield is all the more person for Jaspal who has been bullied because he looks different to other young people his age. Sometimes Jaspal feels he would like to cut his hair in order to fit in and not stand out, but he is inspired by stories of his Great Grandfather who fought during the World Wars with his identity intact. If his forefather could do that during times of such adversity can Jaspal do the same?
