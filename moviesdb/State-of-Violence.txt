State of Violence

 Bobedi, is a member of Johannesburg's new black business elite. Returning home from celebrating a promotion with his wife, Joy, he finds an intruder waiting for them in their home. The masked man seems to know Bobedi personally and shoots Joy in front of him. Bobedi is shattered, but not surprised. Before he took on the trappings of success, he had lived a violent life. When the police fail to pursue his wife's murderer vigorously enough, Bobedi enlists his brother Boy-Boy to help him track down the killer.
