The Young Composers Challenge

 Follow five teenagers through a summer in which they try to compose a classical music piece for their local philharmonic orchestra. Can they do it? This competition that nurtures young composers culminates in the fall when winners are announced and their compositions are performed before a live audience in a symphony hall.
