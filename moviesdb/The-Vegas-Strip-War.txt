The Vegas Strip War

 Rock Hudson (in his last made-for-TV-movie role) plays Neil Chaine, a charming Las Vegas hotel/casino owner who tries to turn his decaying building into The Strip's top attraction to avenge his outting by his former partners who run a more fancy hotel/casino just across the street.
