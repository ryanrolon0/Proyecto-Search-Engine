The Ewok Adventure

 The Towani family civilian shuttlecraft crashes on the forest moon of Endor. The four Towani's are separated. Jermitt and Catarine, the mother and father are captured by the giant Gorax, and Mace and Cindel, the son and daughter, are missing when they are captured. The next day, the Ewok Deej is looking for his two sons when they find Cindel all alone in the shuttle (Mace and Cindel were looking for the transmitter to send a distress call), when Mace appears with his emergency blaster. Eventually, the four-year old Cindel is able to convince the teenage Mace that the Ewoks are nice. Then, the Ewoks and the Towani's go on an adventure to find the elder Towanis. On the forest moon of Endor, the star cruiser of the Towani family lies wrecked. The Towani family are stranded. Mace and his little sister, Cindel, befriends with a magical Ewok and embarks on a quest to find their missing parents named Jermitt and Catarine who were captured by the giant monster known as the Gorax, in a journey that leads them into the most secret regions of Endor. The Starcruiser of the Towani-family crashes on the moon Endor. Father and mother Towani get seperated from their 2 children Mace and Cindel. The children are found by Ewoks, inhabitants of Endor. Although communicating is a real pain at first, Mace and Cindel persuade the Ewoks to help them to find their parents.
