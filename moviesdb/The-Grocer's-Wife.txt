The Grocer's Wife

 Mrs. Friendly, the grocer's wife, tries to seduce Tim Midley, who lives with his bossy mother, and works monitoring the pollution from a large smokestack. One night his mother is taken to hospital after being overcome by the pollution, and Tim invites a stripper, Anita Newlove, to stay in his house until the weekly train departs. Anita refuses to leave, and takes his mothers place after she dies.
