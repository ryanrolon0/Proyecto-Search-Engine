Rock & Roll Superhero

 Everyone has a dream; becoming a successful rock musician is Watt White's dream and his obsession. Shot over the course of three years, Rock & Roll Superhero, follows the ups and downs of Watt's hopeful path to superstardom, from his origins in a thematic costume band to a tight, sophisticated act that's looked upon with interest by major record labels. He and his bass player form the core partnership of the band, joining forces with two Israeli musicians-for-hire who eventually cause Watt to go into serious debt. A clash of cultures and styles arises within the band, inspiring a change in music and image which leads them to the brink of a major record deal. But when disastrous gigs threaten Watt's chances, he must choose between his loyalty to his friends and his own blind ambition. A cultural Anthropologist who saw the film told me Watt White's struggle for fame is symbolic of the American character - a fascination with fame, a belief in one's grand destiny, and a yearning for riches.
