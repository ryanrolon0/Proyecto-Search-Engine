Radiant

 A genetically-engineered virus, meant for good, but never before tested on humans, has found a host. This is the story of four desperate people who, in their search for medical answers, were exposed to this created virus, called radiant, and the solitary lab assistant who becomes their only witness. Four desperate people, inadvertently infected with an experimental 'perfect virus', take kaleidoscopic ride into the heart of the desert and to the outer edges of the human experience. Seeking to quarantine themselves, hunted like plague-ridden animals, they run as Frankenstein's monster did away from all the people, into the wastes of the parched Southwest, watching each other with a dreamlike fascination as the virus begins to change them. What are they becoming? Will they live long enough to know? Come with them to a place called the City of Stones, where age-old fears meet the New Flesh--where man becomes radiant. Four people, all haunted by chronic, misunderstood medical ailments, are accidentally exposed to an experimental viral therapy in a laboratory accident. Rather than surrender themselves to a government quarantine, they flee into the surrounding desert- choosing to let the untested virus run its course in them. The results are unexpected, beautiful, and terrifying.
