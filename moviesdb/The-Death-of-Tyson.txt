The Death of Tyson

 Patrick Nkandu, a child orphaned by AIDS, grew up and died on the streets of Lusaka, Zambia. The short documentary video THE DEATH OF TYSON tells his story. We share the experience of the hundreds of thousands AIDS orphans in southern Africa who are homeless and are the target of constant violence. Yet the story is not one of victimization, but of extraordinary love and courage. We hear of young street kids forming their own little families and the work of heroic volunteers who support them, even as we hear the lies and denials of government officials. THE DEATH OF TYSON is a window into the crisis of street kids in Africa in all its complexity.
