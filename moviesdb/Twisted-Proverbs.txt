Twisted Proverbs

 This is the first film in a series twisted proverb short films that reexamines classic sayings. An older man who has been married for what feels like a million years, makes visual lemonade from a lemon of a wife. His new perspective allows him to see his marital situation in a new light, or lack thereof. If he can't change his situation, he can at least change the way he looks at it, and her.
