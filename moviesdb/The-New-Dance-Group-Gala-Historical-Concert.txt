The New Dance Group Gala Historical Concert

 The DVD includes such legendary dances as decade", THE DESPERATE HEART (1943) by Valerie Bettis, and the darkly dramatic LYNCHTOWN (1936) by one of the founders of Modern Dance, Charles Weidman. There are important choreographers who highlight the American black experience, such as the dancer anthropologist, Pearl Primus, who created a dramatization of a poem about the black experience in THE NEGRO SPEAKS OF RIVERS (1944).
