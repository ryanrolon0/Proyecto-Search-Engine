Rakshak

 Raju lives a poor lifestyle in rural India along with his parents. He meets with a wealthy city girl, both fall in love, and get married much to the chagrin of her father who decides to separate them with much success. When she gives birth to Akila, she goes to meet with Raju, but he refuses to speak with her. Now an Engineer, she is assigned the task of building a railroad bridge that is jinxed by the frequent appearance of a ferocious and fearless lion that continually preys on laborers. Local people believe that the site of the railroad bridge should have been a temple, as an idol of Devi Maa was found buried there, but the authorities refuse to believe this. They seek the assistance of Raju to kill this beast and he agrees to do so. Whenever he sets a trap, the lion avoids the trap and manages to kill even more laborers. Raju's parents, while trying to protect Akila, are also killed. Then one day Akila goes missing and both Raju and his wife, temporarily setting aside their differences, begin a frantic search little knowing that she has wandered on to the territory of the lion.
