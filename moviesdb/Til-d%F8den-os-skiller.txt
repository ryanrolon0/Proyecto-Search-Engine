Til døden os skiller

 Ordinary Jan has no easy life. He is by far the most unpopular employee at work. At home it's even worse. His marriage with the not so ordinary Bente is on the verge of a breakdown. Jan's boss finally sends him into group therapy where an unlikely friendship emerges between Jan and the two mechanics Rudy and Alf. Had Jan only known, that Alf loved Opera, and had Bente known what Rudy and Alf were up to, they would never have let them into their home. On the corner of chance and destiny, their lives take unexpected turns.
