The Corrs at Christmas

 The Corrs play a very special live concert at London's legendary Wembley Arena. The 116-minute set includes songs from their third album, "In Blue," a brand new version of their instrumental "Paddy McCarthy," and a special performance of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's "Happy X-Mas (War is Over) ."
