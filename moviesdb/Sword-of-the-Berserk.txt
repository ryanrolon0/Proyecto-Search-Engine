Sword of the Berserk

 Gatsu, a swordsman belonging to a former band of fighters, stumbles upon a disturbed town while wandering the wilderness with his companions Puck the Elf and Caska, a traumatized woman whom he is trying to cure. He discovers that the town is victim to a deadly disease called the "Mandragora". He makes a deal with the ruler of the town to retrieve a cure, so his doctors can cure the people, and probably Caska with it. But can Gatsu trust the Baron?
