Treason

 Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg, proud of his heritage as a German officer, sees Germany sliding into the moral chaos of the Nazi regime and Hitler's war. After he is maimed in North Africa, he decides to risk everything - including his reputation as a patriot, his life, and above all the safety of his family - in an attempt to remove the Nazi regime and bring peace to Europe. He plants a bomb in Hitler's Wolf's Lair. Convinced Hitler is dead, he flies back to Berlin where he launches a coup. The uprising meets strong initial success, gaining complete control in Paris and Vienna, and apparent control in Berlin. Just as power is falling into their hands, the plotters waver at news of Hitler's survival. Despite Claus's exertions, gradually the rebellion unravels. Claus dies before a firing squad - but leaves his family and country inspired by his example.
