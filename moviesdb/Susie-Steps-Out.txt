Susie Steps Out

 When her father, Papa Russell (Percival Vivian), loses his job because of illness, adolescent Susie Russell (played by newcomer and top-billed Nita Hunter) poses as older than she is in order to get a job singing in a night club. Complications arising from the deception involve her older sister Clara (Cleatus Caldwell), who works at an ad agency and the radio crooner, Jeffrey Westcott (David Bruce), whom she is in love with.
