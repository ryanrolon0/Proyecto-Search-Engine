Texas Trail

 During the Spanish-American War, Colonel Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders are short of horses, and Hopalong Cassidy and his Bar-20 friends are detailed to round up a bunch of wild horses, but a renegade and his gang are out to stop the roundup. The Army needs 500 horses and Hoppy has been sent to round them up. After he and his men do all the work, Carson arrives and plants ten of his branded horses among the group. Then he and his men arrest Hoppy and his crew for rustling and make plans to hang all of them and then sell the horses. In this 14th film of the 66-film series that is credited on the film as being based on Clarence E. Mulford's novel "Tex"... but isn't, other than some character names...the United States Army needs horses for the Spanish-American war but all attempts to get wild horses from the Western plains has failed as the gathered herds have been taken by rustlers. Colonel Whitely instructs Major McCready to secure the services of Hopalong Cassidy who, meanwhile, has been training his men as a volunteer force. While disappointed at having to work as a civilian, Cassidy answers the call to the flag and with the help of Lucky Jenkins, Windy Halliday, Smokey and the other cowhands, rounds up a herd of 500 wild horses. Black Jack Carson and his henchmen Hawks, Shorty and Brad steal the horses and capture Cassidy and his men. With the help of Boots, the Colonel's son, and Barbara Allen, Lucky's sweetheart, Cassidy manages to escape, regain the horses and capture Carson and his men.
