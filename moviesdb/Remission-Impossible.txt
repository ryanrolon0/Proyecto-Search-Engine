Remission Impossible

 Drs. Johnson and Baker are research scientists at a cancer institute. Eager Dr. Baker feels that Dr. Johnson is on the cusp of a cure, but the older and more weary Dr. Johnson can only think about going home to his wife at this, the end of another long day at the lab. But Dr. Baker convinces Dr. Johnson to take one last look at his findings before going home. Believing that Dr. Johnson's research has indeed found the cure for cancer, the two doctors celebrate in an unexpected way. Can anything dampen their both their professional and personal breakthroughs?
