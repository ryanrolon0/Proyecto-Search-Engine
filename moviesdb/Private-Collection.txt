Private Collection

 A wealthy art collector and his wife have their property broken into in this strange, awkward comedy. Little does the thief realize, but the most prized artwork in the collection is protected by a small guillotine. He loses his hand and is then blackmailed into robbing an art dealer, who earlier in the film refused to sell a statue of an eagle.
