Radio Pirates

 It's 1965 and rock music is shaking up the world but not in Auckland New Zealand. One man's determination will challenge, inspire and lead a bunch rebel deejay's into an un-chartered political nightmare. A boat called the Tiri will be their freedom, broadcasting from international waters to avoid prosecution. Based on a true story, a bold bid to free the airwaves and bring rock n' roll to the people.
