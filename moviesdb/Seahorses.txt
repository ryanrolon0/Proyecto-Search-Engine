Seahorses

 Since the death of her mother, eight-year-old Iranian Mina has lived with her biological father and his male partner in Berlin. Treated differently because of her family, Mina acts out against her dads. Family friend Shahla worries that Mina lacks female role models, and invites her to take part in a female-only religious ceremony, but she has her own problems with her rebellious teenage daughter. Rahman Milani astutely reveals the cross-cultural tensions between tradition and assimilation, religion and family, in his feature debut. Mina (8 years old, originally from Iran) is living with her biological father (Babak) and his partner (Paul) in Berlin. During the course of a religious celebration only for women, Mina is being treated differently than the rest of the girls because of her family situation. Finding her fathers incapable of doing anything to change the unjust situation she stops talking in protest. Meanwhile Shahla who arranges the celebration, is having difficulties at home with her teenager daughter (Hoda) who shows little or no interest in Shahla's traditional values and way of thinking. The tension between Shahla and Hoda leads to Hoda's rebellion against her mother. Shahla finds herself soon captured in the past that she has been trying to escape from.
