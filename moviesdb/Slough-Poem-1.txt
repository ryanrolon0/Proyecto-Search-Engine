Slough Poem 1

 An electric look at the silence before the storm. We see streets while original poetry is presented both in voice over and in subtitles traveling across the screen. The video documents the last hours of the twentieth century, capturing downtown and suburban Copenhagen, Denmark. Footage shot on New Years Eve 1999/2000.
