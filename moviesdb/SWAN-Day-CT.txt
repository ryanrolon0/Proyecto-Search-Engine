SWAN Day CT

 At the end of March every year, women all over the world celebrate SWAN Day, an international event started by the organization WomenArts. SWAN stands for Support Women Artists Now, and it's goal is to support women in the arts. SWAN Day CT, Connecticut's version of the festival, takes it to a whole new level. SWAN Day CT is the only celebration to cater to all genres of art - music, film, visual art, spoken word, dance, photography, and all mixed media. A story of inspiration, drama, conflict, encouragement and most importantly, the arts.
