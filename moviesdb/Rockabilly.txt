Rockabilly

 Martín is a 19 year old spiritless boy who works in a music rehearsal studio and attends a literary workshop. In the vigil following his uncle's death he sees his cousin Diego, whom he has not seen in a long time. Diego invites him to join his group of friends, where Martín meets, and immediately falls for, Nadia. After failing his attempts to pick her up, he meets Charlie Calltrop, a Rockabilly legend. Influenced by him, Martín will elaborate a plan to reach the girl of his dreams.
