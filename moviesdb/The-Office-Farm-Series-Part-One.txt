The Office Farm Series Part One

 "ELECTRIC MESSIAH" is a slice of life from an office after hours. Kevin the temp lets us into his secret occupation Corporate office worker. While Kevin is keenly informed of the species he is studying, he has lost sight of his own sanity. Live cadavers, vaudeville entertainers, and a book full of fingernail clippings are just the tip of the iceberg. Kevin embarks on a lucid examination of corporate malaise through the window of his own collapsing mental state.
