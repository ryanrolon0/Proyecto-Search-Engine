The Lark

 A disturbed woman takes refuge in a decaying abandoned building with her children. When a mysterious man and woman enter her gloomy territory she realises her children's lives are in danger and will stop and nothing to protect them. But is everything what it seems? A disorientating and disturbing journey into the world of Niamh and her two children, a seemingly endless maze in which every corridor disappears into an infinite darkness that can suddenly part to reveal uncanny scenes and characters. Still, Niamh has made a home here, a shelter from a poisonous world outside, where they live under the protection of Niamh's strange friends while she tries to discover a way they can escape to safety. Then the balance of the nightmare is disturbed by intruders from outside. The violent Jackson and the prying Siobhan claim to have come here in search of a missing friend. But the truth seems to be very different - the newcomers have plans for Niamh that can lead them all to disaster.
