The Henley Regatta, 1901

 This is one of the finest moving pictures of a boat race ever secured. It shows the finish of the final for the grand challenge cup, the Leader crew of England winning by 1 length from the University of Pennsylvania. The picture gives a very comprehensive view of the crowds watching the race, at the same time keeps the boats in full view throughout the length of the film. It is particularly interesting at the end, where a number of the men in the boats collapse from the tremendous exertion.
