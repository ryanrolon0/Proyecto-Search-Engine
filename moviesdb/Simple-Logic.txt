Simple Logic

 Simple Logic follows an angst-ridden Los Angeles man on the day leading up to his 30th birthday. His paranoia builds as insecurities about money, family, love, and career start to manifest themselves in real and surreal ways. If he can't control his fears, he may not survive the day. But time is short - and the clock continues ticking inexorably towards Midnight.
