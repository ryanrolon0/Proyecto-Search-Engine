Teacher, Teacher

 Hamilton Cade is an alcoholic teacher striving to put his life back together. He accepts a job tutoring an "exceptional child" only to find that young Freddie is mentally retarded (an outstanding performance by retarded actor Billy Schulman). A black man who works for Freddie's father also becomes interested in teaching the child, and becomes a second role model for him. A "Hall of Fame" production.
