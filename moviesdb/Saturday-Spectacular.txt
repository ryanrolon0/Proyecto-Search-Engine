Saturday Spectacular

 Gordon Jenkins' record album "Manhattan Tower" was a best seller for 12 years and this spectacular is based on it, with book, music and lyrics by Jenkins, produced and staged by him as well. The story is of a young man named Steven, visiting New York City and falling in love with Julie. Together they do the town, with music and dance this production is a vintage classic.
