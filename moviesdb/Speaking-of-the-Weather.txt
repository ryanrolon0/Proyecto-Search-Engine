Speaking of the Weather

 It's midnight at the bookstore and all the book and magazine characters are coming to life. When a bulldog from an adventure book uses a Boswell Sisters-like performance by girls in a travel magazine as a distraction to rob a bank, he is chased, caught, and sentenced to, of course "Life" (the magazine). But there's also a conveniently placed "Escape" magazine.... The magazines in a drugstore come to life. Among the scenes, 'Ted Lewis (I)' (qv) plays a number; a conductor leads the Storm movement from the William Tell Overture, which segues into the title song sung by a girl trio (the Boswell Sisters); 'Hugh Herbert' (qv) is seen repeatedly smiling and adjusting his tie. A bad guy sneaks out of Gangland, commits a crime, is sentenced to Life; his breakout is covered by 'Walter Winchell' (qv) and a wide variety of characters join the chase, even Santa.
