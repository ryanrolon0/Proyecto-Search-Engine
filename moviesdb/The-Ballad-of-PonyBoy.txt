The Ballad of PonyBoy

 An out-of-work guitar player is forced by his girlfriend to get a job as a "pony photographer", taking pictures of kids and ponies on the mean streets of East L.A. Along the way, he gets beat up, smoked out, flirts with a sexy senorita, loses his pony, and kicks out the jams in this documentary-style, very musical look at life in modern day Los Angeles.
