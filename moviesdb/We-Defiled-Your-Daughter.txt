We Defiled Your Daughter

 Britney is pregnant. See, there was this party, and in the spirit of fun and fancy free whoreishness, she decided to have sex with four different guys at the party. None of this was good news to Britney's overbearing, steadfastly catholic, lawyer of a mother. But in an attempt to turn lemons into lemonade, her mother decides that she would like to meet these young men to find out if any of them are worth keeping around... or just destroy them... or at least their spirits. Only, they are not as intimidated, or as cooperative as she would like.
