Tri Cycling Africa

 Jeff McLean was so annoyed with the current western perception of Muslims that he and his one cameraman rode a tandem recumbent tricycle through five countries in West Africa. For two months and 1000 kilometres they pedaled hot dusty roads and often found warm welcomes, great character and selfless generosity. With no real plan, tents or sleeping bags, Jeff finds an honest side of Africa that is rarely seen. But there are frustrations; breakdowns, language barriers, exhaustion, and theft leaving them stranded and desperate. Africa is often seen as either a place of poverty and corruption or of exotic wildlife - Tri Cycling Africa reveals the opposite in both cases. While touching on the poverty and desperation of the locals, it also shows a hardy, happy, diverse population in a hard but spectacular land and a noble and generous race of people.
