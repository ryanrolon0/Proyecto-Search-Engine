The Amazing Trousers

 The Amazing Trousers is a comic and Gothic tale, set in Edwardian England. The story follows Henry, a meek loser who agrees to buy a pair of red trousers from a mysterious wheel-chair bound tailor. The trousers bring him success in life but in exchange, he will have to give up his legs after one year. We discover the Tailor had his own legs removed by his patron, a cruel Maharaja who was scared the trouser-maker would take his talents elsewhere. Our protagonist feels little sympathy though, as he awaits his own leg-related fate. The Amazing Trousers tells the tale of a mild bank clerk who enters into a Faustian pact with a sinister tailor, agreeing to trade his legs after one year in return for enjoying glorious success. The success is brought on by a pair of red trousers...amazing red trousers.
