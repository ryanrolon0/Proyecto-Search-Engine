Terra Fria

 In the forties, in a little settlement lost amidst the mountains of Trás-os-Montes, Leonardo tries to survive by buying and selling marten and fox furs, dreaming of the day he'll close a big deal. His wife Ermelinda, the prettiest girl in the village, starts to work as a maid in the house of a man called Santiago, nicknamed American. His manners, charm and indirectly his wealth finally seduce her, and a child is born. To get rid of her the American gives her money and helps Leonardo close his much sough-after deal. Meanwhile the American concentrates his attention on Guida, a girl of 16 who also gets pregnant. Santiago decides to court Ermelinda again, and she kills him in a fit of rage. Ermelinda tells her husband she killed the American in self defence. Leonardo takes responsability for the crime and flees to Spain to the house of his friend Iglesias. Some time later Leonardo realises he is not the father of the child and leaves his refuge to confront Ermelinda.
