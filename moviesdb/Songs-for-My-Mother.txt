Songs for My Mother

 A story inspired by a set of wardrobe photographs Kubrick took for a movie he never made creates the backdrop for a relationship between two women to develop and be explored. Krystyna is an actress. Esma is the Wardrobe Mistress. Krystyna and Esma have a lot in common first and second-generation refugees from war torn areas of Europe. As we delve into their pasts, we unravel the hardship they have been through, the difficulty they have in connecting with their current environments and the similarities between them.
