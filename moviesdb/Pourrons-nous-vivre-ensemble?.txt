Pourrons-nous vivre ensemble?

 In a low-income development on the fringes of Paris, the ashes of the night's riots drift down onto the lives of its youth. Games, rap, intimacy, boredom, and tension resonate amid the concrete. On the street, demonstrations see groups clash and splinter. Meanwhile, in the 6th arrondissement, students at Fenelon Lycee meet between classes, embrace, share their fears, and imagine their future. Sociologist Alain Touraine, old enough to be their grandfather, tries to give meaning to a fractured society. He is welcomed with open arms in Latin America where his ideas still find an audience. Chronicle of a year in Paris.
