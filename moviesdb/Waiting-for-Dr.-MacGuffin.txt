Waiting for Dr. MacGuffin

 The film is a dark, comic view of an elderly Latvian man's anxiety during a visit to the Dentist, filmed as a series of dreams, one within another, each differentiated visually. WAITING FOR DR. MacGUFFIN is a tribute to the cinematic technique of Alfred Hitchcock, incorporating references to distinctive cinematic elements from films such as Blackmail, The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train, Spellbound, Vertigo, Psycho and others.
