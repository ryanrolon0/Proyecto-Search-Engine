The Illogic of a Dream Had Taken Over Completely

 An investigation of cinematic rhythms & harmonies (color, movement, image) in terms of the (il)logic of a dream of longing. A blend of abstract cinematic language in the tradition of Oskar Fischinger & surrealist live-action imagery in the vein of Un chien andalou.
