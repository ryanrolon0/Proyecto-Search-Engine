The Rehearsal

 The Rehearsal documents the behind-the-scenes preparation of 4 performers, one week before their big show entitled 'Inspired Voices.' Each of these performers has received mental health support in their lives. Through performance, each person is able to publicly share their story of recovery and demonstrate the power of art to connect, heal, and inspire. This film captures remarkable talent and courage. It also explores the concept of mental health and illness - not as two mutually exclusive 'diagnoses,' but as a state of health that we all must develop and protect.
