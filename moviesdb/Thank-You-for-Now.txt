There are times when inspiration can arise from the strangest of situations or moments, that can lead us not only to 'creation' for one's self, but even possibly find 'redemption' or else 'destruction' for another. A film set in modern times, 'Thank You For Now' is a tribute to strangers who silently co-exist amongst us searching for a meaning to live. The story juggles between the lives of two such people who like many live every day in regret. 'The boy' (Mark Parakh), a young pianist is tired of his mundane existence and is longing to write that 'perfect' score. Then, 'The girl'(Arya Anil), who is yet to come to terms with her failure as a ballet dancer when she was a child. They live a life in solitude, away from the rut of the society. However, it is only a matter of time before they cross paths and help inspire each other in their own strange ways.
