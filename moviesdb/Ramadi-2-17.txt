Ramadi 2-17

 John Staros and his buddy, Richards, joined the Army to earn money for school and to help out their families; not to go to war. When faced with the realization that he is being deployed, Staros declares that he does not support the war and will go to great lengths to avoid betraying his non-violent beliefs. However, things become more complicated once he finds himself and his buddy facing some life threatening situations.
