Vae soli

 If a man finally found himself alone, the sole ruler of an empty world, his eternal desolation might be interrupted for a moment by memories of a different world. There is a meadow in that world; there are some butterflies there. The biggest and the most beautiful of them all has just found a yellow flower - just the thing he has been looking for. He has admired his flower as only a butterfly could until a mine - installed under the flower by a man - threw him away with a blast. From the smoke cloud, a butterfly appears, his colors dim; the butterfly burns like a piece of paper, and the smoke carries it, turns it around and toys with it. The burnt butterfly cannot master the unknown game butterfly will loose its shape, fall apart and turn into dust. Black flowers and butterfly's ashes cover the meadow of the man's memories, creating a different world.
