Poussieres d'amour - Abfallprodukte der Liebe

 German director Werner Schroeter invited his favourite opera singers to a 13th century abbey near Paris. LOVES DEBRIS didnt have, and couldn't have had, any pre-planned action. There was no script, no continuity. On the other hand, there were precise constraints that provided the rules of the game Each singer came accompanied by a person of his or her choice, and worked on an aria chosen by the director. And there was ELISABETH COOPER, a "one-woman orchestra", who transposed and played the scores on the piano and organ.
