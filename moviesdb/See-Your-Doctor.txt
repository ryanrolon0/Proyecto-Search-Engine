See Your Doctor

 A lecturer tells us that it's National Take Care Of Week, but take care of what? Probably your health, he surmises. Cut to Joe Doakes's household he's been outside in the garden when a bee stings him. His brother-in-law, a worrier, thinks maybe it was a black widow spider, and he insists that Joe rush to see a physician. At the clinic, a nurse takes a long time filling out the forms, and the doctor is tied up talking on the phone to a child; when the doctor finally he examines Joe's hand, will it be too late?
