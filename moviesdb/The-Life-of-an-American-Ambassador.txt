The Life of an American Ambassador

 Pace University students traveled to the Netherlands for the Spring 2010 documentary course. They followed US Ambassador Fay Hartog-Levin and documented her role and duties as an appointed official to the United States. The video examines her in-depth contribution to the United States and her role and relationship between the two countries. The students were given the honor and privilege to shadow Ambassador Levin throughout her week. The state department granted the Pace University students unprecedented access.
