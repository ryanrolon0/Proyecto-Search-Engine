The Sickness Is Coming or, The Blind Man's Television

 In a small unscarred piece of land, not let corrupted by the deceit of technology, three not-young children are consumed by the advent of imminent change. The centre piece of their obsessions; HABITUAL ALOHA, which is to be the last film ever made, echoes their fears and the finality of a world that will no longer exist.
