Resurrection

 The story of famed Houston Astros Fastball Pitcher J.R. Richard, from his high school days in Louisiana, his first round draft pick in 1969, to the massive stroke he suffered in 1980, to his abandonment by the only team he ever played for, to his living as a homeless man under a Houston bridge, to his Resurrection by friends and fans back into baseball.
