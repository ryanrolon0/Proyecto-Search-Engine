The Master's Preference

 Two life-long friends, ELIZABETH and GLINDA, meet at a local cafE for relaxation and good conversation. There conversation soon veers towards their favorite subject - movies. They discuss Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic methods in regards to his ideas on suspense. After a few minutes, their academic discussion takes an unusual and deadly turn. Elizabeth's boyfriend is cheating on her and he and his new girlfriend are in the same cafE. Glinda asks Elizabeth if they will take care of him like all of the rest. Elizabeth tells a surprised Glinda about the new method that she wants to use to rid herself of the cheating couple. A method that will test Hitchcock's ideas, and an ending that would make "The Master" proud.
