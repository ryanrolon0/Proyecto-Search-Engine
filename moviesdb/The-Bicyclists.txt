The Bicyclists

 A twenty-something Conrad Miller leaves a small town in Wisconsin, promising himself sixty days to make lasting memories before he returns home to take over his parent's cheese factory. Conrad journeys to Portland, attracted to its vibrant urban bike culture and beautiful scenery. Conrad makes valuable friendships and has a decidedly modern love affair with Steve Jones. The friends learn to love and live like never before, but this simple story reveals unexpected turns and darker elements as the sixty-day timeline counts down.
