The Twelve Days of Christmas Eve

 Calvin Carter, a successful business executive, has it all, but neglects those closest to him. On Christmas Eve, all that changes when the sign on his office building falls on him. He awakes in a hospital bed, attended to by Angie, a nurse who soon lets him know he has 12 days (12 chances) to get his act together and achieve the "perfect" Christmas Eve. If he doesn't, there will be dire consequences. Calvin Carter is pleased for the retail chain The Buck Stops Here, which he saved from bankruptcy when his dad's mind went. Never mind he thus missed all family fun on Christmas Eve. Only walking home after a drink with his loyal right hand Drew, he has a fatal accident. In the hereafter he learns the day will start over up to twelve times 'til he 'does it perfectly', not what is 'perfect'. After treating this as a chance to improve business-wise, Calvin realizes it's probably a humane thing, but every attempt to be more generous fails to stop the next freak fatal accident.
