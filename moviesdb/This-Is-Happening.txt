This Is Happening

 Told in real-time, This Is Happening is a six minute comedy that depicts a typical suburban house party from the simultaneous points of view of those on the porch and those in the kitchen. Unbeknownst to them, each character's actions have a direct and often funny impact on themselves and others, building to an unexpected climax. It combines elements of slapstick and situational humor to offer a glimpse into the lives of five friends and a sixth uninvited guest. This Is Happening is, at its heart, a demonstration of cause and effect and a cursory exploration into the minutia of suburban life.
