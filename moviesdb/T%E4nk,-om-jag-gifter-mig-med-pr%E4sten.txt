Tänk, om jag gifter mig med prästen

 Eva Oern is a newly graduated teacher, who becomes a school teacher in rural Vikarlunda. She is a beautiful young woman with firm opinions and she does not live up to the locals' picture of the ideal female teacher. She has an affair with the priest, Ingvar Hagson, but they have to keep their love a secret.
