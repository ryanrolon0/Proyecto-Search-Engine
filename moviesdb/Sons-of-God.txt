Sons of God

 The seventh trumpet, heralding the return of the Christ has been sounded. Micah has been ordered to take Demeteri, the fallen angel, to the lake of fire. However, things are not so simple, Micah is torn by the memory of the Demeteri he knew before the fall. Whilst Demeteri will not accept that the battle is over.
