Two Wrongs Make a Right

 Ivan Rogers is Fletcher Quinn, a successful and respected nightclub owner, in a fast- paced metropolis who is deadly serious about protecting those things he cares most about; his friends; his lady friend; his livelihood...and his life! Quinn's very existence is threatened by a sleazy cut throat extortion kingpin named Jack Balentine who is trying to force him to capitulate to his protection racket. One night Balentine sends Lake, his menacing "right-hand man", to solicit his services to Quinn at his club. Quinn refuses which results in a violent and horrific massacre of his friends and patrons by Lake and his soldiers. After the incident, hard-nosed cop, Lieutenant Zander and his partner, Sergeant Vellosi are called in to investigate. They suspect that Quinn's tragedy is a result of his possible association with something illegal, and/or someone criminal. They press him for the truth, but because of a past experience with the law, Quinn has no faith in the ability of the police to bring about justice. With the police hot on his heals and a cold vengeance in his heart, Quinn embarks on a mission to bring down Lake and Balentine. Meanwhile, Balentine and Lake learn of Quinn's vendetta against them and attempt to thwart his efforts by physically assaulting Jayna, his lady friend, and killing Winston, a lifelong friend of Quinn's family. In spite of the warnings from Lt. Zander and Sgt. Vellosi to let the police handle all of this, Quinn continues along an inevitable collision course with Lake and Balentine. After an involved action-packed search for the two miscreants, Quinn finally corners Balentine and Lake. Before the police are able to intervene, Ivan Rogers proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that two wrongs don't make a right...unless you're Fletcher Quinn!
