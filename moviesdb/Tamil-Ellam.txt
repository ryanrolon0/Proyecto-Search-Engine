Tamil Ellam

 After 26 years of fighting for a free nation the forces of LTTE were crushed and defeated by the Sri Lankan army. In the process thousands of civilians were killed, injured and almost quarter of a million people displaced from their homes. Many have been put up in refugee camps in miserable conditions and with the lack of any proper humanitarian aid and help, the Tamils in Sri Lanka are suffering! The Sri Lankan government said it would continue to provide access to humanitarian agencies, which was not really acknowledged by the agencies. President Rajapaksa says he will begin talks with all parties - including the Tamils - to bring about lasting peace.
