Pyojeok

 A man who defected to North Korea returns as a spy, but his feelings of guilt drive him to consider suicide. He falls in love with a woman who was attempting to throw herself under a train. She convinces him to turn himself over to the police, but he decides the best way to make up for his spying is to take vengence on the North Korean commander.
