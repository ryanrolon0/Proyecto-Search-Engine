 Girl comedian sits in dressing room remembering her story, in bed with her boyfriend, trying to act like the audience that laughs at her doesn't hurt her deep inside at the same time...she is startled by a knock at her dressing room door giving her a 5 minute warning for her next performance coming up...she wipe the tear out of her eye and goes for the stage...sad but true...
