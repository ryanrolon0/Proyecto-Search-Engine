Son of the Mask

 Ten years after the adventures of Stanley Ipkiss in Edge City, the legendary Mask of Loki finds its way into the hands of an aspiring cartoonist, Tim Avery whose new baby son named Alvery is born with the Mask's spectacular powers. But the really big trouble begins when Loki himself the god of mischief, comes looking for his mask, under command by his father Odin. And he's willing to do whatever it takes to get it back. A cartoonist named Tim Avery loves his dog, Otis, more than anything in the world. But when Tim and his wife have a baby, Otis starts to feel left out. But then Otis finds an enchanted mask and plots to be rid of the baby once and for all, but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, up in Valhalla, Odin is infuriated at Loki for losing the mask and orders him to go get it... Aspiring cartoonist Tim Avery is feeling inadequate about being a father when he finds that his newborn son has some amazing abilities - the baby has the powers of the Mask of Loki, a mythological object that transforms its user into a manic shape-shifter alter-ego. As bad as a baby with godlike powers might seem, the 'really' bad news is that Loki wants his mask back...
