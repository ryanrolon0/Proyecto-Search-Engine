Recording Studio Bondagettes

 Sharon dreams of recording a audio tape of nothing but the gagged mewing of beautiful woman securely silenced with cloth tied between their teeth. Lacking willing participants, she advertises an audition for female singers. When the two buxom vocalists arrive at the studio, they are immediately stripped, bound and muzzled. The rolling tape captures every muffled complaint.
