Say You'll Be Mine

 A young man has a long-time obsession with his best friend's fiancEe. Sensing something amiss with her friend, she tries to set him up with her best friend, a bubbly actress. While attracted to the new woman in his life, he invariably compares her to his ideal woman. His only other personal contacts are a hardened, chain-cigarette smoking divorce lawyer whose husband is never home (and gets shot when he makes a surprise home visit), and a married couple who are constantly fighting when they are not having noisy out-of-control sex all over the place. With all of these characters surrounding him, the young man struggles with what his relationships should be like.
