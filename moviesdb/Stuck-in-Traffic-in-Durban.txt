Stuck in Traffic in Durban

 Upas is a happily married Indian woman, one problem - her mother in law. She decides to get rid of her so she can have some peace with her husband. When she is on her way to get rid of her mother in law, who she has tied up in the back of her car, she gets hijacked. It seems too good to be true - let the hijackers have the car and the mother-in-law. Only she's too much for the hijackers and it all comes back to haunt Upas.
