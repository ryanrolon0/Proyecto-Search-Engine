Rock-A-Doodle

 A little boy named Edmond learns that the crowing of Chanticleer the rooster did not make the sun rise, as everyone thought. But when a flood threatens his family's farm, Edmond sets off to get Chanticleer to make the sun rise and save the day or the rain will keep coming down forever. Edmond gets turned into a kitten during this adventure, for no apparent reason other than that cats are easier to animate than humans. Meanwhile Chanticleer has moved to the city, and although the farm seems to be in the Midwest, the nearest city is clearly supposed to be Las Vegas. Chanticleer is now the King and now he has to hurry, because the horrible owls, who love the darkness, are coming. The rooster on the farm, Chanticleer, has to sing every morning for the sun to rise. One morning, he is stopped from singing and the other animals discover that he's a phony - the sun rises anyway. He becomes an outcast and runs away to the city. However, the animals discover that this was a mistake, because the sun stops coming up and rain, which causes a flood, begins instead. A few of the animals decide to go into town to find Chanticleer and ask him to come back. And they have to hurry, because the horrible owls, who love the darkness, are coming.
