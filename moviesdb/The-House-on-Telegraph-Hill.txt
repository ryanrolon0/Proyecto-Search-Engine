The House on Telegraph Hill

 Victoria has survived Nazi concentration by assuming the identity of one who died there. She arrives in San Francisco to see her "son" just as the boy's great-aunt dies leaving a lot of money to be inherited. Victoria falls in love with the boy's trustee Alan Spender, and they move into the mansion on Telegraph Hill. She then learns that Alan and his lover, the boy's governess Margaret, murdered an aunt and are planning the same for her. At the end of the war a concentration camp inmate takes on the identity of her close friend who has just died. Eventually she is able to emigrate to San Francisco, claiming to be the mother of the child the other woman sent there shortly before the war. She discovers that the boy is heir to considerable wealth and that her arrival is not welcomed by some of those at his home on Telegraph Hill.
