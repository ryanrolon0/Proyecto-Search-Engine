Singin' in the Corn

 Judy McCoy, a fortune teller with a circus, learns she has inherited some property and heads west to collect. When she arrives in the desert ghost town, she learns that a stipulation in the will is that she has to return the property to the rightful owners, an Indian tribe, before she gets the remaining inheritance. A gambling ring, led by Honest John Richards, will gain possession of the town if it is not returned to the Indians. The latter believe the town is haunted, because of the schemes of Honest John, and do not want it.
