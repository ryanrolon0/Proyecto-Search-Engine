Prairie Spooners

 Cowhand/musician Ray (Ray Whitley) and his girlfriend Virginia (Virginia Vale) attend a barbeque where Ray and his cowhands provide the music. Virginia drops a locket, showing a picture of her mother, and Pop Whitley picks it up and recognizes Virginia's mother as a girl he had once courted, and lost her after following her to Oregon. Ray and Virginia decide to get married and not repeat Pop's story.
