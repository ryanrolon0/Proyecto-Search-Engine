Walking with Dinosaurs

 Because of the engineering challenges involved in constructing life-sized walking dinosaurs, it has remained uncharted territory in puppet making - until now. We follow a team of special effects experts on an epic journey as they attempt to build 15 dinosaurs for the spectacular "Walking with Dinosaurs - the Live Experience" arena show. In just 12 months they must create what took mother nature 165 million years to achieve. From concept to creation, we follow not only the build process, but also the people behind it, their triumphs, frustrations and humour in an extremely frank and detailed look at a working special effects workshop.
