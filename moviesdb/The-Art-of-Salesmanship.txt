The Art of Salesmanship

 Ronnie, Stewart and Tracy work the graveyard shift at Burger Wonderland, one of Dublin's worst take-away joints. After their boss, Ricky Bottom, docks yet more money out of their pay packets they bet amongst themselves to see who can sell a festering burger. With all of their money riding on the sale of just one burger it is essential that they utilise their very best sales techniques ... no matter how unorthodox they may be!!!
