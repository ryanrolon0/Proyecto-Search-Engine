The Consumed

 The Consumed is a modern updating of the mad scientist theme. When Shelly meets Jim he seems harmless, intelligent and a little intense. His excitement for a nutritional formula he has invented isn't necessarily shared, but she agrees to partake. The experience is like none she's ever had, and leads to a whole new outlook on Jim. As his obsession with the formula increases, Shelly backs off. She's wary of the changes in him and stays away. The formula however has other ideas.
