The Montana Kid

 Larson cheats Burke at cards, has him sign over the deed to his ranch disguised as an IOU, and then kills him in a supposedly fair gunfight. This sends Bill Denton into action and he robs Larson and his henchman Gabby until he has enough money to buy back the ranch. When Larson realizes he received his own money back, both Larson and his men and the Marshal go after Denton. Bill Denton rides into town and meets his friend Burke and Burke's young son Andy, and while Bill and Andy help Molly Moore with her shopping, the elder Burke, who has been known to have a drinking and gambling problem, ambles over the saloon to wet his whistle. Saloon owner Chuck Larson and his henchie Gabby engage Burke in a friendly game of poker, with lots of cheating directed against Burke's side of the table, Burke loses a bundle and signs what he thinks is an I.O.U, but is really a deed to his ranch, worth much more than his gambling losses.And then Burke is killed in a rigged gunfight, and Bill and Andy arrive to find that Andy is not only an orphan he is also homeless. After a few days of putting up with the kid at his place, Bill decides a better course of action would be to get the kid's ranch back for him. So he sneaks out at night and begins to rob Larson and his operations blind, and soon has enough money collected to buy back the ranch. But some of it is identified by Larson as coming out of his own stack, and since a cheater can't stand another cheater, Larson feels put upon and justified at filing a large complaint against Bill with Marshal Jack Barclay. Now Bill has the law after him along with Larson and crew, plus Andy and Molly think he is a crook also.
