The Drill

 It is the late 1950's is in its infancy, and the nuclear bomb looms over every American's head. During a citywide civil defense drill, three sixth-grade boys become increasingly worried as the drill lasts longer than previous ones. Tensions mount when an air raid siren unexpectedly blares, and from the intercom, the principal orders everyone to move into the hall. Oblivious to events outside, hundreds of scared children are instructed to take cover along the hallway walls. All becomes quiet until the distinct sound of airplane engines approaches. A quiet terror overtakes the children.
