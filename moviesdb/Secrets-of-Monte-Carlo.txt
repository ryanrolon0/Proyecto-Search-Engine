Secrets of Monte Carlo

 An Eastern potentate, the Rajah of Bandor, and his American bride, are robbed of a fortune in jewels on the Riviera, by a quartet of thieves led by Otto Von Herzen. The gang flees to Hon Kong, followed by Charles Reeves, Britisg insurance investigator, and his sister, Susan. Bill Whitfield, a none-too-bright American entrepreneur, gets involved with Stella Strutzenbacher, a flashy and stylish member of Herr Von Herzen's gang. The gang, already riddled with dissension, are easy pickings for Whitfield, Charles and Susan to capture and recover the Rajah's jewels.
