The Young Prime Minister

 Luke is bright, politically aware boy who wants to grow up to be like his idol, former Canadian Prime Minister 'Pierre Trudeau' (qv). He has a good relationship with his mother, Rita. When Rita takes Luke out shopping to buy a new pair of shoes, it is with trepidation and a bit of reluctance that she agrees to the pair that he wants afraid of the reaction of all the other children at school to the color. Will Luke's classmates call him a sissy like Rita fears, and even if they do, does it matter?
