Topsoil

 Topsoil is a darkly comic film noir. Told partly in voice-over, the action of this short seven and-a-half minute film unfolds as MIKE explains how he's come to be buried alive. This is a tale of the underworld, in more ways than one, as cross and double-cross lead to a trip to the countryside that is anything but a picnic.
