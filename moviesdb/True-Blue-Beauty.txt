True Blue Beauty

 Set in the 1950's, "True Blue Beauty" tells the tale of a young girl who inadvertently sits down next to the man of her dreams. Unbeknownst to the girl, however, the man she tries to win the attentions and affections of is dead...or is he? Humorously dark, "True Blue Beauty" is a tribute to both the 1950's and silent film, and will keep you guessing until the end and long after.
