Red Coral

 Carrying only a guitar and a secret guilt, he has to overcome the language barrier and challenge of finding the one family that can help him face his inner demons. As Jack becomes obsessed with his own suicide, his only glimmer of hope is the name of the family he searches for that is engraved in the back of his Fender Stratocaster. On his quest for self-forgiveness he encounters many interesting characters that help him, not only in his search for the family, but on his journey of self-discovery as well. He learns lessons about death from the wise old Zhao, and lessons about life from the seductive and rebellious Jing-Yu. As Jack gets lost on the streets of Taipei his imagination helps him deal with the stress and pressures of being so far away from home, as Jack's surreal imaginings manifest themselves as animations. From north to south, through mountains and across beaches, from the dingiest alleys to the swankiest penthouses, Jack searches across Taiwan. His quest eventually leads him to a beautiful yet terrible decision, forgive himself or die.
