Three Inches

 A story told from the viewpoint of Walter, a 20-something average guy who gets jolted by lightning. He then discovers he has the ability to move objects with his mind. But there is a major caveat - he can only move objects three inches at a time. He is then recruited by a 'league' of heroes with similarly underwhelming abilities.
