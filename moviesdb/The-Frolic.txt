The Frolic

 A prison psychologist returns home from his last day at work, an early retirement brought about by prolonged exposure to his latest subject, a serial killer known only as John Doe, who preys upon children. Doe is a psychotic Peter Pan who describes his murderous actions or "frolicking" as a way of "freeing" the children from their drab, earthly confines.
