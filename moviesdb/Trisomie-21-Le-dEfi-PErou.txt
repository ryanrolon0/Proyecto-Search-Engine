Trisomie 21 Le dEfi PErou

 Six young adults with trisomy 21 and six specialized education students live together an out-of-the-ordinary experience more than 2000 meters of altitude and doing a humanitarian project. In this mythical place, each day is a challenge and everybody surpasses their limits. This group invites us to a journey of gift, of tolerance and of open-minding to difference.
