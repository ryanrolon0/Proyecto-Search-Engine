The Curse of the Screaming Dead

 A group of six friends are out in the rural south on a deer hunt (even though one of the six is blind), when they start hearing strange noises coming from the woods. An investigation of the sounds leads them to an old Confederate graveyard, which suddenly begins sprouting Rebel zombies. Like the living dead in every other movie, these zombies are hungry for human flesh, and soon set to chowing down on the hapless hunters.
