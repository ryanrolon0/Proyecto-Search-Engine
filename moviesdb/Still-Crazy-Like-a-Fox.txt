Still Crazy Like a Fox

 Harrison Fox Snr ('Jack Warden' (qv)) and Harrison Fox Jnr ('John Rubinstein' (qv)) are two of San Francisco's most successful private eyes. During a vacation in England they inadvertently become the prime suspects in a murder case, and must go on the run in the British countryside with the whole of the police force on their trail.
