The Little Magician

 The streets of New York are rough. Our protagonist, simply known as "Man" knows that all too well. Every day, he rises and walks the streets, doing what he can to survive, but he feels the stares, the looks of disdain and the disappointment from those he crosses paths with. Exhausted. Ashamed. His life is in shambles. You can see the sadness in his eyes and in his world weary face. A young boy comes along with dreams of being a magician. He has learned a basic card trick and wishes to share his magic. The Man is amused by the young boy and decides to show him a thing or two and blows his mind with elaborate trick.
