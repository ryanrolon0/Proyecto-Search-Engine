Under Your Spell

 Anthony Allen is a former cowboy who has become a famous concert singer and star. His manager, Ptroff, is so good that he has lined up more dates and concerts that Allen can possibly do, so Allen heads west to his old profession. This leaves Petroff with a problem or two, and also leaves Cynthia Drekel, a spoiled socialite, with one of her own; she has made a bet that if she can't get Allen to sing at a party she is throwing she will marry a worthless young nobleman, Count Raul Du Rienne, who has been pursuing her...and her money. Since they don't come any more worthless than Count Raul Du Rienne, Cythia saddles up and heads west to bring back Allen. Actually, she takes an airplane.
