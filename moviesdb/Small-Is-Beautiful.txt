Small Is Beautiful

 Up to age forty-five, Fritz Schumacher, economist, technologist and lecturer, was dedicated to economic growth. Then he came to believe that the modern technological explosion had grown out of all proportion to human need. Author of 'Small Is Beautiful Mattered' and founder of the London-based Intermediate Technology Development Group, he championed the cause of "appropriate" technology. The film brings us into contact with this gentle revolutionary a few months before his death.
