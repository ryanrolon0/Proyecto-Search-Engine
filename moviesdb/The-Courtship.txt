The Courtship

 A silent film made in the tradition of the 1920's Keaton/Chaplin style, The Courtship is a romantic comedy about how two unlikely young professionals find love at the work place and struggle to keep their romance a secret. Chet and Julia meet while working together at a Lower Manhattan office. Though Chet is immediately enamored, Julia plays aloof and reaps the attention received from other male co-workers. Gradually, the two develop a friendship and eventually begin a private office affair. After dating for a month though, Chet is promoted and the two are forced into working as partners, sharing a cubicle, and keep their romance a secret. Can they possibly survive the internal torture? Will their office find out the truth or will they let the cat out of the bag in their own way?
