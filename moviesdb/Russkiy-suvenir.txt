Russkiy suvenir

 Corny Soviet propaganda of the Khrushchev's era when every American was considered capitalist enemy of the Soviet people. 60-year-old actress Orlova plays a young beauty who makes these ugly capitalists love the Soviet Union when their plane makes a stop in Siberia and then arrives to Moscow. The ugly capitalists, played by approved Russian actors, are impressed with the Soviet Union's prosperity and their loud comments sound like some lines from a typical Soviet communist party report.
