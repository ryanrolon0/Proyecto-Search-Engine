Thanks for Giving My Number Back

 Filmmaker Michael Trigilio has nightmares that he is a Christian rock star. Plus, he's receiving phone calls from beyond the grave. And some released convict wants his phone number back. An innovative experimental film, Thanks for Giving My Number Back is packed with great humor and thought-provoking moments of personal anxiety and grief. Featuring a cast of non-actors (mostly family and friends of Trigilio), the film blurs the lines between fiction and documentary, keeping the audience guessing throughout. Equal parts self-portraiture and science-fiction, the story shapes itself into a tangle of chuckles, heartache, and anxiety.
