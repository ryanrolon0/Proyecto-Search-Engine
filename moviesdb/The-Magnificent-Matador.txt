The Magnificent Matador

 Karen Harrison is a spoiled, rich, American predator who falls head-over-heels for the brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador, Luis Santos who has inexplicably run away prior to a corrida that was to occasion the "alternativa" of a young, up-and-coming bullfighter. The mystery is solved 94 minutes later, after Maureen has conquered Tony and Tony has saved Marueen's life by caping a toro bravo with his plaid horse blanket.
