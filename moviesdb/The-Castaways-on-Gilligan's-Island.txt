The Castaways on Gilligan's Island

 Stuck on the same island as before, the castaways find an abandoned World War II bomber that the Professor is able to repair and fly. However, in the attempt to fly to Hawaii, Gilligan falls out and has to parachute down to the island. Against their better judgement, the gang decides to return the island to get him. Unfortunately, the engines collapse after they land, which means that Gilligan had screwed up yet another escape attempt. Their despair is quickly dispelled when a U.S. Navy captain appears saying that their plane was detected on radar long enough for them to follow it to the island. A year later, the island is now a tropical resort spot fully linked to Civilization, and the castaways work as the staff of a kind of island Love Boat as they work to entertain the various guests they receive.
