Road to Hunter

 Two aspiring journalists embark on a 4000 mile road trip to crash Hunter S. Thompson's memorial, where his ashes will be shot out of a cannon over his fortified compound. They hope to publish an article documenting their exploits. Can an iconoclast, drug addicted, gun loving wild man, who came to celebrity status in the 1960's possibly help guide two young writers today?
