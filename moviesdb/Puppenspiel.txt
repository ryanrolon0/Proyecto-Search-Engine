Puppenspiel

 A young woman strays trough a children's room, in search of something uneasy to grasp. It makes her anxious, nervous, but she hopes that here it materializes. A man, also seeking something, wanders through the house. A little girl plays with a doll. What seems to be a peaceful play in perfect harmony becomes the despairing effort to deal with the violence she has faced and felt. In play, the experiences are lived through again in order to form an ally. An ally that knows and understands.
