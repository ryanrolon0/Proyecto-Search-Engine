Steal Away

 A documentary filmmaker follows a college chorale along the route of the Underground Railroad. The songs the chorale carry forward in modern day were once songs that slaves sang as they traveled from the South to Canada. Along the way, historic sites like the Dawn Settlement, and Harriet Tubman's church are seen.
