The Weary Hunters and the Magician

 Two hunters who have procured no game are seen to be lamenting their misfortune in a forest. A magician appears and advises them that for a renumerative consideration he will produce a quantity of game for them. They immediately accept his proposition and hand him the money. The magician then takes off his silk hat and produces a large number of rabbits therefrom, and as they scamper through the forest, the hunters bring them down with their shot guns. They are profuse in their thanks to the magician, and stringing their rabbits on a pole, start for home in a victorious manner.
