Shinobu gokoro

 Mayu and Hitoshi are worried about their friend, Shinobu. When she's not in class, all she does is sit in the library and read historical novels, to the point of ignoring everything around her. When Mayu notices that Shinobu has a crush on Kawasaki, the captain of the soccer team, she jumps at the opportunity to get her friend's head out of the books and back into reality. Unfortunately, Shinobu sees Kawasaki as the hero of her novel, who is the real object of her affections. Hitoshi, meanwhile, must keep his affection for Shinobu hidden in order to help her.
