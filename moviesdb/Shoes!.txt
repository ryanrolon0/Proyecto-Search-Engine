Shoes!

 Crystal loves shoes. In fact, she has about 130 pairs of them. We want to know why. In SHOES!, we follow Crystal as she discusses her love of high heels and what made her the collector she is today. Featuring interviews from shoe culture experts and Buddhists we discuss the pros and cons of collecting and consumption to answer the question in our shoes say about our generation?
