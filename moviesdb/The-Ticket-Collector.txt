The Ticket Collector

 When locomotive lunacy arrives on No Sense Railways, dodgy ticket collector Ronald Swift thinks he can take advantage of lone passenger, the beautiful Marcella Ashford. Until a Polar Bear from Ronald's secret past appears to torment him about the madness of having to buy a ticket to buy a ticket. An original catchy soundtrack and a cameo appearance from a 60's football legend compliment this comical fight back against railway bureaucracy.
