Researching Raymond Burke

 After the death of his mother, a middle-aged man seeks the admiration of his nephew by inviting him to a hotel in a seedy riverbend town. As a way of catharsis, he arranges for a woman to meet his nephew/surrogate son in a selfish act of redemption; as a result Raymond brings larger problems between the two to the surface.
