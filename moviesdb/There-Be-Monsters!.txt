There Be Monsters!

 Leaving the safety and comfort of their village, Tom, Billy, George and Ron set out to climb a mountain. Along the way, they meet an Inn-keeper and his daughter, a Farmer, and even a King in a fairytale castle. At every stop, they are warned about the monsters that lay ahead. But things do not always work out as planned, and as they proceed, the four friends will each have to decide for themselves where their real quest lays, monsters notwithstanding.
