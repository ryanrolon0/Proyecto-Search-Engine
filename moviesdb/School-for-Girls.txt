School for Girls

 Annette Eldrige, who has met a young man, who happens to be a jewel thief, has been caught with some stolen jewels and is sentenced to three years in a reformatory. There a sadistic lady is in charge, making life terrible for all, and, further more is embezzling money. A member of the board of trustees falls in love with Annette and due to this tries to change some things in that school. Annette, penniless and hungry, accepts Nell Davis' offer to meet a man "in the money"--Elliott Robbins is the man and he provides Annette with money and clothes, but two weeks after their meeting she accompanies Robbins to his home, where detectives are awaiting him. Robbins is really Buck Kreegar, jewel thief, and both are taken into custody, and Annette is sentenced to three years in the State School for Girls. Miss Keeble, head matron of the school, is inhuman and brutal in her treatment of the girls, while Miss Cartwright, the assistant matron, offers sympathy and understanding. Annette learns that several, like herself, are innocent. Annette is assigned to the school farm. Gary Waltham, wealthy playboy member of the institution's board of directors, visits and is attracted to Annette. He plans to have her paroled but the evil Miss Keeble has other plans for Annette.
