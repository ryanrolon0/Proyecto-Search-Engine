 A documentary that explores how seven remarkable people embrace their pain, learn to live with their loss and now engage in life with more compassion, courage and awareness. The personal and moving stories include those of author, Isabel Allende; Reverend Cecil Williams; filmmaker, Lee Mun Wah and Zen Monk/Vietnam Veteran, Claude AnShin Thomas. With courage these people invite the viewer to open to the pain of grief and discover for themselves the extraordinary opportunities their own losses may reveal.
