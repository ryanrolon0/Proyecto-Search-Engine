Unloading the Elephants

 It is seldom our privilege to see so many Elephants at one time as we can see in this picture. Their number seems to be unlimited as they are seen to emerge from the comfortable box cars in which they have been transported from New York to Philadelphia. All sizes pass into view, from the baby Elephant to the Monster, the largest Elephant in captivity. As he stands alongside of the train the large cars seem too small to hold him. It is too terrible to contemplate what damage this great hulk could do were he to break away from his keepers.
