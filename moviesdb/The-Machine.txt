The Machine

 When low-level employee Josh Riley (Bill Doherty Jr.) comes across an old film reel amongst the dusty inventory, he inadvertently uncovers the fatal flaw in the company's revolutionary machine, Visual Audio Enhancement Simulation. Josh takes a stand against the corporation to prevent the release of V.A.E.S., but Via-Tech CEO Mark Felix (Greg Paul) decides to give Josh a sneak preview of what his new program can do.
