Save Child

 In addition to promoting greater public awareness of the needs and rights of children worldwide, Alliance members coordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the effects of disasters both natural and man-made. Most recently, members of the Alliance launched Rewrite the Future, a pro gramme to bring quality education to 8 million children in countries affected by conflict. Together, they are working in 16 countries to try to ensure access to education for 3 million children and improve the quality of education for 5 million more, to make schools safe and protect children from exploitation and abuse, and to influence national governments and international institutions to make quality education a priority for children affected by conflict.
