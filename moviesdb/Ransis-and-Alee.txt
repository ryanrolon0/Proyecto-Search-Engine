Ransis and Alee

 Join Ransis and Alee (a dog and a cat) on a midnight romp in search of food where ever it may be - on the street, in garbage cans and in every crevice. But in this strange town the mismatched duo are forced to battle an evil that's bigger than both of them. The outcome proves monstrous.
