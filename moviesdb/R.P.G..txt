 This documentary shows an in depth look at the world of table top fantasy role play games. Dungeons and Dragons and War Hammer are some of the more popular titles one might hear, but this isn't a "how-to" type of film. It is a celebration and examination of how smart, imaginative people invest their wits into their favorite leisure time activity. The interviews with the gamers themselves goes beyond the "Trekkies" type fandom flick one might expect from the subject matter. Literate, informative, funny and entertaining, RPG will have the viewer wanting to get into a game after watching.
