The Toy Chest

 Connor Ryan is a toy-obsessed suburban dentist who is afraid to fly. When Connor's oppressive stewardess wife barbecues his favorite toys in front of his parents, Connor conquers his fear of flying on a journey to replace what he lost, only to discover he what he was looking for wasn't toys at all, but rather someone who understand the need for play.
