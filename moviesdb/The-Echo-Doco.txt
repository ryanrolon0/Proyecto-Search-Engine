The Echo Doco

 When a ragtag bunch of freethinkers started a newspaper in 1986, no one ever imagined it would still be thriving 25 years later. A portrait of a vibrant, unique community then and now, 'The Echo Doco - Born To Be Trouble' highlights the police abuse, the zany characters, the scandals, the tragedies and the anarchic spirit that gave rise to 'the voice of the community'.
