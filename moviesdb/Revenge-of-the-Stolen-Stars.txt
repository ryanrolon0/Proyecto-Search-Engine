Revenge of the Stolen Stars

 Klaus kinski plays the ghost of Duncan McBride, murdered owner of a plantation and ruby mine on the island of Sunanow, in the South China sea. The mine, and the Curse which killed his uncle, are inherited by the inept Gene who comes from San Francisco to look for the Six Stars, (missing rubies) accompanied by the lovely Kelly Scanlon and persued by the villanous Alex and Lupe.
