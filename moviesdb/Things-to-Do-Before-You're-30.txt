Things to Do Before You're 30

 Amateur football [soccer] team Athletico Greenwich exists 20 years and is determined to celebrate their 500th match, especially the six veterans who were in it from the start. Life keeps getting in the way of playing, just as it frustrates the lists of things to do before age 30 made by the juniors, as proven by the over 30s' experience, such as Collin's obsession to have a threesome with girlfriend Vicky and her mate Sheera. Captain Cass resents his pregnant girl Kate's intent to focus their entire lives on the baby. Collin's house mate, would be musician Dylan, should answer to his dad. Johhny as taken in his cripple step-dad Don, once the team's mentor. Real or alleged homosexuality is a tender issue.
