Striper Time

 Sportsman Coot Hall fishes for striped bass (aka striper) off the coast of Cuttyhunk Island, MA using a boat. Sportsman Harry A. Watkins surf fishes for striper along the beaches of Montauk Point, Long Island, NY using a Jeep to change locations. Both men display their lures, equipment, fish locating methods, casting techniques, and catch. This Sportscope follows two striper fishermen. The first is Coot Hall, who lands his stripers on his boat in the bay near Cuttyhunk Island. The second is Harry A. Watkins, who walks out in the surf at Montauk Point, and casts for his stripers. Both men are shown to be very successful in landing large striper bass.
