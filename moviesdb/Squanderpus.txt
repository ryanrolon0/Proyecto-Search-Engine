Squanderpus

 Man's negligence has left the sea in a blanket of darkness. Only a small population of glow fish emitting the only light source is left in a once thriving kelp forest. Wandering through the kelp forest Squanderpus spots the glow fish illuminating the sea and selfishly takes them to use for his own light. Over time as he captures the glow fish their population dwindles down to nothing and Squanderpus is forced to find a way to bring light back down to the sea floor or face the consequences of his, and mankind's, actions.
