The Santa Clause 2

 Scott Calvin has been Santa Claus for the past eight years, and his loyal elves consider him the best Santa ever. But Santa's got problems (he's even mysteriously losing weight) and things quickly go south when he finds out that his son, Charlie, has landed on this year's "naughty" list. Desperate to help his son, Scott heads back home, leaving a substitute Claus to watch over things at the Pole. But when the substitute institutes some strange redefinitions of naughty and nice, putting Christmas at risk, it's up to Scott to return with a new bag of magic to try to save Christmas. Scott Calvin a.k.a. Santa Claus has two problems, first his son, Charlie has been acting up and as a result of this, is now on the naughty list. And it seems that according to the rules, Santa Claus must be married, so Scott has to go back and find someone to marry and help his son. So he leaves and one of his elves creates a toy Santa to take his palce until he returns. Now the toy Santa seems to be working but after reading the rule book, he believes that the former Santa and everyone there doesn't follow the rules to the letter, so he makes some changes that doesn't seem right.
