The Company You Keep

 A poisonous relationship in small town America. Two men who work together and fish together, but really don't have anything else in common. They stay friends out of necessity for fear of being alone. Finally after years of co-existence their problems come to a head as they are digging for night-crawlers one early spring day. A surreal look at the absurdity of any-town USA and the pathetic existence of some of it's residents.
