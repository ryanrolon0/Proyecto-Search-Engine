The Way of Peace

 This extremely rare film is a Christian parable told with puppet animation. It scope is broad the atomic destruction of the earth. Extremely preachy, heavy-handed, and basically totally unlike ant other film in Tashlin's body of work (though it has some small connections to his Say One for Me).
