Strangled 2

 Two more tales of unending horror! "The Model Killer" stars Tina Krause and Dawn Murphy as two models who are offered an "adult photo shoot." They strenuously object and leave. The photographer gets even by knocking them unconscious with chloroform and carrying them to his studio where he binds and gags them and then takes his photos. But one of the models tries to escape, leading to tragic consequences for both. In "The Poolside Murders" Dawn and Debbie D star as two friends who ridicule a salesman who then comes back and "teaches them a lesson".
