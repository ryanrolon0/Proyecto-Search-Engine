The Kiss Goodnight

 There are those who don't say what they think - they're called average. There are those who say, what they don't think - they're called liars. And there are there are those who say what they think martyrs. The Kiss Goodnight is a dark comedy about speaking your mind and facing the fears everyone faces - well, that is if they dare to look the right way. It's a satire about realizing that prior to living up to expectations, one must first learn to live.
