Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen

 The film is a comment on a society that brands people into images they should be, and talks of individual dreams and aspirations. Set in the background of a small town in India, against the harsh weather conditions and lack of rain, the story revolves around a girl who is unconventional in her ways and appearance, in-feminine in the conventional sense of the word, and therefore subjugated to much negative public opinions and advices on what she should be. She is supported by a supportive just father, a younger brother who is about to turn 18 and a realistic, discouraging but loving older brother. And in their lives then enters a man who believes in magic and tells them that he can bring rain! The story unfolds with much poetry and a dreamlike quality that is magical.
