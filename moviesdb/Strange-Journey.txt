Strange Journey

 Reformed racketeer "Lucky" Leeds flees from the police when he thinks they are about to arrest him for a murder he didn't commit. He and his wife Patti fly to his privately-owned remote island and have to crash land. Also on the island is a group of shipwrecked people, including a German professor, his daughter, an English journalist, a wealthy widow, a sailor and a Nazi Agent. Just before the professor dies, he gives Leeds a map showing the location of uranium deposits. The Nazi agent's accomplices arrive by plane, and Leeds and Patti engage them in a gun battle.
