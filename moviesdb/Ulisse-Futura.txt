Ulisse Futura

 The plot is strongly linked to the social customs that most of the occidental world has seen in the last fifty years, notably through the breathtaking growth of construction and infrastructures which have transformed the landscape and its conception, thus profoundly affecting socialite and its purpose and customs.The two main characters compete for a vast terrain beside the highway, confined by a natural oasis left over from an old mine. One is a potential buyer and the other is the heir to the property, of which he knows nothing about. 'Ulisse Futura' is the name of a massive abandoned factory built on the land.
