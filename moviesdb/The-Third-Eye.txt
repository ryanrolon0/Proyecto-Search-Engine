The Third Eye

 Patrick O'Malley wakes up behind the wheel of a running Jaguar with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As flashes of his memory return, he catches a glimpse of his dark past and is forced to confront the people he harmed whom he doesn't remember. The pieces slowly come together and the reality of his treacherous past force him to embrace who he really is (the very person he was trying to forget) in order to set himself free. After all, no one can erase their identity in one night.
