Red Wine

 Charles Cook, a husband with a multi-year itch decides he will go out and whoop it up with the boys, but tells his wife it is a business meeting. His helpful friend Jack Scott introduces him to a very pretty-and-shapely Miss Scott, whose stock-in-trade is understanding misunderstood husbands, and she is very good at it. Charles enjoys being one of the boys and schedules more business meetings. Meanwhile, his wife Alice is at home wishing her husband didn't have to go to so many business meetings.
