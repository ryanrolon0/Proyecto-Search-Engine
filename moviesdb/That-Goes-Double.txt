That Goes Double

 At the announcement of the winner of a newspaper's contest, singer Russ Columbo finds he has a double. He hires the double to take his place at personal appearances where he would not be required to sing. Complications develop when Columbo is hired for a society party. When his double sees a picture of the woman who will be hosting the party, he goes in Columbo's place.
