The Great American Office Worker

 It's a jungle out there in the American office. 'Office Worker,' the sequel to 'North American Smoker,' (1998) is an close and personal study of the dog hump dog atmosphere of the corporate environment-- from ass-kissin' snack food foragers, to drivelling executive assistants and Bosses who show up at the wrong time. Just like on the Discovery Channel, 'Office Worker' reminds you that we're all mammals.
