Swimsuit

 A mockumentary about a group of swimsuit models hired by a fictitious Chemical company to shoot a product catalog. The movie spoofs the whole Baywatch-Sports Illustrated obsession with calendar girls as it follows the travails of models forced to shill for a company covering up oil spills, defective breast implants and synthetic food substitutes.
