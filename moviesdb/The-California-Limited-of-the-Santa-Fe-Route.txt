The California Limited of the Santa Fe Route

 A fine view of one of the grandest and most beautifully and fully equipped trains in the world. This picture was taken near Los Angeles, Cal., and shows the foliage of that section of the country. The train is full vestibuled, electrically lighted, and is running at the high rate of 65 miles an hour. We call your attention to how steadily the cars ride, causing no jumps or flickers in the picture.
