The Squeaker

 London's jewel thieves are under the thumb of a mysterious fence, who ruthlessly exposes any thief who crosses him. Desperate, Scotland Yard re-hires ex-Inspector Barrabal who, as a known drunkard, is ideally suited to go undercover with a faked criminal record (which may spoil his chances with lovely Carol Stedman). Interested parties his girl, sexy dancer Tamara; Collie, sardonic reporter. Then murder makes apprehension of the Squeaker urgent. A mysterious fence of stolen gems is hated both by Scotland Yard and the underworld. The first because he is elusive and the second because he betrays those who will not sell to him at his own price. Inspector Barrabal, once one of the Yard's smartest and most-respected men, but now a disgraced drunk, is given a chance to make a comeback by rounding up The Squeaker.
