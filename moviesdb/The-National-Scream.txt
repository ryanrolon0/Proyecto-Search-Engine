The National Scream

 This animated satire/documentary takes a comic look at Canada's national symbol 'the beaver'. It is a few days before Canada Day (July 1) and Canada's national beaver has disappeared. Horrors! All available resources are mobilized to catch the thief and return our precious symbol.
