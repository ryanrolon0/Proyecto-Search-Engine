Querido Camilo

 Dear Camilo is the story of Camilo Mejia, the first American soldier in the Iraq war to have deserted the military and publicly declared himself a conscientious objector. His two high school friends from Costa Rica, after ten years of no contact with him, learn of his whereabouts and confrontation with the U.S. military through the international news headlines.
