Too Many Girls

 Hollywood casting director Frankie Matera is your typical womanizing player. On one evening two of his 'girlfriends' both unexpectedly show up at his apartment half an hour after the other. In order to not blow his cover, Frankie separates the girls in two different rooms and spends the night running back and forth between both rooms. Will Frankie find true love with either of these girls or will the girls catch on to what Frankie's up to?
