Trout on the Wind

 Trout on the Wind removal of Hemlock dam and the restoration of Trout Creek in the lower Columbia River Gorge. The Hemlock Dam was a concrete structure built by the Civilian Conservation Corps to provide power and irrigation for a work camp in the area. However, in the 1970s the dam became obsolete and had to be removed to improve water quality, habitat, and passage for Lower Columbia River steelhead. The dam was removed and the natural processes in the watershed were restored. This project brought the local community together and provided an excellent hands-on learning experience. With this project, the Columbia River Gorge is fast becoming the heart of modern day river restoration.
