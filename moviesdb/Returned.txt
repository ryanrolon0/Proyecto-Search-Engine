Returned

 Shangri-La to hell in ten years country, become home to the most dramatic Maoist insurgency in modern history? "RETURNED Nepali boys and girls as they attempt to reintegrate into civil society after fighting with the Maoists in the "People's War." The film confronts Maoist leaders and examines why these children are compelled to join armed groups. The film explores the prevention of future recruitment through the voices of former child soldiers and experts in the field. Imagine being forced to leave your family and fight in a war you don't understand - and you are only eleven years old. Sadly, for many of these child soldiers in Nepal this is a reality and the peace process has not solved their problems. These children quickly discovered that the return home is even more painful than the experience of war. Returned is a feature length documentary that follows several Nepali child soldiers including Asha, a young Nepali girl, who was sent home from the Maoist's People's Liberation Army after the cease fire. Asha joined the Maoist army when she was 14-years-old. For this young low caste girl, joining the Maoist was a pathway to a future with education and employment. Despite two years of being on the front lines, her biggest concern was what would await her when she returned home. Would she turn to commercial sex work, become a domestic slave, or would she be banished from her home and forced into marriage? Returned weaves the voices of Nepal's child soldiers, organizations working to help them, and military leader's from Nepal's opposing forces, who answer the challenging questions about their use of child soldiers.
