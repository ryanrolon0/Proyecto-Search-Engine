Something Blue

 Michael and Jackie are a happily betrothed twosome - as the raw footage attests. Their initial meeting at a party was captured on videotape; Michael has arranged for his marriage proposal to be taped; and there will also, of course, be a video of their wedding. Why not frame such pivotal moments within a complete chronicle of the wedding planning process, they wonder? So the couple enlists the help of a friend to follow them around and catch all the precious moments on camera dresses, addressing invitations, hosting family dinners. But when tensions begin to rise, their videographer finds himself tracking more drama than scenes of bliss. While Jackie tries valiantly to manage the turmoil, the charming but hapless Michael finds himself caught between his relatives and his bride-to-be. And as the carefree spirit in which they undertook their documentary project dissipates, a happy ending looks through the viewfinder to be increasingly uncertain.
