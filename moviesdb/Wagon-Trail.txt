Wagon Trail

 The son of Sheriff Clay Hartley, of the frontier town Elder, has gotten into bad company and hangs out with an outlaw gang in which, Collins, owner of the Golden Rule Saloon, is the secret head. Sheriff Hartley suspects him, but has been unable to gather the needed evidence. Collins instructs his gang, including young Hartley, to hold up the stagecoach on its return trip from Missionary Flats and take the cargo of gold dust it is carrying. Sheriff Hartley is notified of the planned holdup by one of his deputies who has been spying on Collins, and organizes a posse. A deputy-sheriff is killed in the ensuing gunfight between the lawmen and the outlaws, but Deputy Joe Larkin, pursues and captures Clay Hartley Jr. The latter is quickly tried and convicted of the killing of the deputy, and sentenced to be hung. Sheriff Hartley has only a few hours to prove his son was not the killer. He enlists the aid of Collins' step-daughter, Joan, who is in love with Hartley's son. Holding Clay Hartley's IOU's, Collins forces him to ride with his gang as they rob the stage. Clay is the only one caught and refusing to talk, is sentenced to hang because one of the Deputies was killed. But Collins knows he will eventually talk and makes plans to beak him out and kill him. But the Sheriff, Clay's father, luckily overhears the plans and hides Clay out while he goes after Collins. A sheriff's son gets mixed up with a gang of outlaws. During a stagecoach robbery, one of the sheriff's deputies is killed and his son is captured and accused of the killing. After a quick trial, the son is sentenced to be hanged the next day. The sheriff, not believing his son is the actual killer, must find the real killer before sunrise the next morning.
