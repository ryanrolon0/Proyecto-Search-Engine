Unconquered Bandit

 Tom plans to revenge his fathers death at the hands of Cleyburn's men. He makes a deal with wanted outlaw the Nighthawk. Then posing as the Nighthawk, he plans to rob Cleyburn until he is bankrupt and also marry his niece Helen leaving him with nothing. But things do not go as planned. Tom Morgan (tom Tyler (I)' (qv)) is seeking revenge for the killing of his father by bandits instigated by a San Diego politician named Frank Cleyburn ('William Gould' (qv)), also the head of a gang of cattle rustlers. Tom begins to court Helen Cleyburn ('Lillian Gilmore' (qv)), Cleyburn's niece, planning to use the girl as a pawn on the chessboard of revenge he plans to take on her uncle.
