Sky Splitter

 After years of testing, a professor who is intent on building a ship that can travel into space finally succeeds and finishes a working model. After he launches himself into space, he realizes that he had forgotten to take into account that aerodynamic controls have no effect in outer space. He drifts through space and lands on a planet 50 light years away, and proceeds to build a giant telescope with which he can see Earth.
