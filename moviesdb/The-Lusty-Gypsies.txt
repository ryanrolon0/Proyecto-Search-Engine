The Lusty Gypsies

 A realistic look at the backstage life of drag and transsexual performers. On stage it's glitz and glitter but off stage the gloves comes off. A day in the life as they struggle to get along and accept each others differences. All the while looking for love in all the wrong places and people. Brianna, a vein and unaware transsexual seeks spiritual advice to find the answers as to why her choices in men don't seem to be good for her.
