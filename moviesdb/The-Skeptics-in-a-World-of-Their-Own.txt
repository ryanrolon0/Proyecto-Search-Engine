The Skeptics in a World of Their Own

 From 1984 through 1990, The Skeptics, a Frederick, Maryland band, hit the music scene with an original blend of surf, punk, pop, and psychedelic tunes. In 2007, Keith Chester began work on a documentary about the band, The Skeptics In A World Of Their Own. The film was completed in 2010 and it offers a fun glimpse into one of Maryland's great unknown bands.
