Virumbugirean

 A fire engine is stationed temporarily in a village with a volatile caste dispute situation following a series of unexplained fires. The firemen do not adjust well to their new surroundings, and one of then, Siva (Prashant) becomes particularly unpopular after picking fights with local leaders. The villagers want the fire engine sent back to the town, for which they have to set aside their caste differences and unite against the firemen. In the meantime, a romance blossoms between Siva and Thavamani (Sneha), a daughter of a village elder. Stretched out, but has some good moments and decent acting, especially by Easwari Rao who plays the go-between set on uniting the lovers.
