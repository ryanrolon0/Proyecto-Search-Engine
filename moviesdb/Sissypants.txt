Sissypants

 Tom and Zoe have a relationship problem 'I Love You' in sign language. When Tom brings Zoe home to meet his parents for the first time, his overzealous Dad reminds them both of Tom's old nickname (Sissypants) and forces him to play a dreaded family game called Effortball, from which Tom's fragile relationship may not survive.
