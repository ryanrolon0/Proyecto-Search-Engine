Potl

 A cold arctic ice flow, penguins stand on the edge of oblivion. A ship's horn can be heard in the distance. A walrus takes a penguin and the others barely bat an eye. The mammoth ice breaker steams steadily toward the ice flow as a drunken sailor makes a scene shooting penguins from the bow. The sailor falls and plummets to his death leaving his liquor gun cigarettes and shades deposited on the ice. A single penguin is left on the free floating block of ice that contains the booty. As time passes he gathers up his courage to inspect the treasure. As he reaches out to touch the gun a walrus surfaces behind him. The gun goes off, the walrus falls back dead, and an orca makes off with the fresh meat. Potl ponders. An explorer paddles his kayak through the frigid waters. He pauses and stares at something as his kayak drifts along...
