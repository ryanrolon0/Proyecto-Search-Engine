Television Blues

 A young professional finds himself discouraged by his bland, pseudo-yuppie lifestyle. He takes a position working from home, hoping that this change will make a difference. He finds himself isolated in his upscale condominium, turning to late night television as a companion. The lines of reality get blurred between his his love of infomercials and his day to day life. He finds himself on a breaking point that forces him back to a primal sensibility.
