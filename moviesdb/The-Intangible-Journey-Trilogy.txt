The Intangible Journey Trilogy

 Three abstract video works centering around rainstorms. These pieces represent an exciting divergence, and evoke a certain sense of mysticism in relation to nature and weather. The glassy surface of the digital image represents the struggle for perceptual clarity in the course of the progression of a singular human understanding. Each of the three pieces has a distinct character which represents a different approach for the first-person narration provided by the camera in this character's attempt to break the surface of our contemporary world- and thus experience the storm and the landscape as genuine and whole. This journey begins with the innocence of a childlike vision of light and color, progresses into a dance with the elements (fixated upon the luminescence of the streetlights), and finally ends with the somber realization that we are forced to make a very difficult choice ourselves into an abysmal and infinite Universe (most likely to be consumed by it).
