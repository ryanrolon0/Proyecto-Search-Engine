Sounds of Buenos Aires

 Sounds of Buenos Aires/Sonidos de Buenos Aires is an short documentary that explores the rich and vibrant musical identity of Buenos Aires by juxtaposing its traditional and modern music forms of tango, folk, and contemporary music. Each genre represents a thread of the multicultural fabric of Buenos Aires and creates a rich tapestry for the ear. Traditionally, tango and folk music serve as a symbol for Argentina's national identity. However, when local musician Santiago Vazquez says he doesn't create music with an Argentine passport, we must pause to consider the universal boundlessness of the postmodern world and explore how it has influenced the current musical identity of this city.
