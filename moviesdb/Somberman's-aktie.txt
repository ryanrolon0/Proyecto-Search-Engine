Somberman's aktie

 A 35 year old man, once a famous poet under the pen name Punk Somberman, hasn't written anything since his last work - also the title of this film. He suddenly loses his job, suffers a crisis, and comes under pressure by his girlfriend to have a child. A good friend and former work mate tries to help him out of his troubles, while encouraging him to write again. However, unforeseen circumstances surrounding the poet, his girlfriend, and his work mate may be more influential in reshaping his life than anything foreseen or planned.
