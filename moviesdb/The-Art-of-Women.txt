The Art of Women

 A narrative feature that tells the fictional story of five women artists in New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC. Told in five, separate vignettes, the characters each overcome artistic obstacles by using their bodies as artistic expression. Heavily driven by music from female bands and musicians, this provocative film explores the boundaries and definitions of art.
