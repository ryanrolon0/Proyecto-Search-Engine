Thavasi

 Noble and just Thavasi decides to get his son, Bhupathi, married to pretty Priyadarshini much to the chagrin of Sankarapandi, who wanted this alliance with his daughter, Nandini. When the Mandir's jewelery gets stolen, the evidence and motive points to Thangarasu; Thavasi accordingly pronounces him guilty, and the next day Thangarasu allegedly kills himself. During the wedding ceremony of Bhupathi and Priyadarshini, new evidence surfaces that Thangarasu was not involved in the theft, and his devastated mother, Maragathammal, aided by Sankarapandi, decide to put Thavasi to make an ultimate sacrifice that will change everyone's lives forever.
