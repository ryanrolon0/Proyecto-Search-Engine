The Dropout

 A young man tired of "the rules" of high school, drops out. While he relishes his newfound "freedom, " he soon finds out that no one will hire a high school dropout, and his life starts to spiral out of control until he's reduced to wearing T-shirts, playing pool, and watching his friends being hauled off to jail for vagrancy. Is he next?
