The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse

 Dr. Clitterhouse is fascinated with the working of the criminal mind. His interest is so deep that he finds the best way to observe criminals in action is to become one himself! Whilst robbing a safe at an exclusive party he stumbles across an organized gang trying to the same thing. He teams up with the gang to observe them in action but one of the members, Rocks Valentine would like nothing better than to see Clitterhouse out of the way. Dr. Clitterhouse is a brilliant, well-respected Park Avenue physician who becomes obsessed with understanding the psychology of the criminal mind. He burgles the homes of four high society acquaintances, stealing high-end jewelry in order to gauge his own physiological reactions to the experience, which he finds exhilarating. On his fourth robbery he crosses paths with professional thieves and seeks out their leaders, Jo Keller, a woman fence, and Rocks Madison, a vicious sociopath. They form an unholy alliance increases the gang's take, while the Runtonesque thieves allow themselves to have their blood and vital signs monitored. Keller's growing attraction to Clitterhouse and the loyalty the gang shows him feeds Rock's growing resentment at being displaced, and his growing paranoia pushes him to try to commit the greatest crime of all, homicide.
