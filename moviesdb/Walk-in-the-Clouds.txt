Walk in the Clouds

 Glacier National Park has enormous water preserves as well as one million acres of undeveloped wilderness. Glacier National Park is not currently designated as 'Wilderness'. All of the beauty and resources of Glacier are at risk as long as the park is not set-aside as 'Wilderness'. The text of the film is intended to drive citizens to promote 'Wilderness Designation' for Glacier National Park.
