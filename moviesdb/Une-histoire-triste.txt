Une histoire triste

 A street, after the rain, under the sweet light of dusk. In a tailor's window, a dummy dressed in a black tuxedo imagines he can goes through the uncrossable to declare his love to the neighbor across the street, a beautiful bookseller. Unfortunately the glass that daily stands in front of him is staying with him in every place of his journey, depriving him of a real communication with his beloved.
