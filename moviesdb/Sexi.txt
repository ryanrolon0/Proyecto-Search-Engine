Sexi

 Body-building steroids, a dangerous date and a drag queen's funeral are woven together with provocative interviews to raise some pertinent questions about our relationship to our bodies and our current attitudes towards HIV/AIDS. SEXI is a fiction film with real events in it. The project was shot on DVCAM video and it grew out of an ongoing workshop involving local Miami actors, performance artists and activists. Instead of following a traditional screenplay, SEXI was developed through improvisations and exercises where each actor created a fictional character using material from research conducted by the director, Juan Carlos Zaldivar, as well as with their personal input. The film mixes camera work by the actors themselves with actual documentary footage of events that went on in the Miami Beach community from 2004 to 2007. Like the unavoidable generational rift that parents and their children must confront (even when they get along), the AIDS epidemic has come of age. What are the consequences of this generational rift between the disease and those who are now getting infected? For example, the alarming disassociation of young people who want to get infected with the HIV virus to the AIDS pandemic is disturbing but not entirely unprecedented. It is grief reinvented. Twenty years into the disease, there is apathy about AIDS and HIV in the media of developed nations. "We don't want to worry about it anymore. It's depressing. It's boring. We are tired. We want to move on. No one that we know is dying. There are drugs you can take. People who are HIV+ can get prescribed steroids, they look beautiful and they can have all the sex they want." Or can they? These are some of the unsettling arguments and uneducated justifications of a new generation of young men and women who have never lost a close friend to AIDS. Forceful and compelling, SEXI asks Who is SEXI? What makes you SEXI? What is the price?
