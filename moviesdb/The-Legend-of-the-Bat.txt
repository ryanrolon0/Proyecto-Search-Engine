The Legend of the Bat

 An adaptation of a Mexican legend, the film tells a story of how we try to be "better" than the others, at all costs, instead of accepting ourselves as we are. In this comic tale, a mischievous Bat makes himself a beautiful costume with the feathers his friends the birds generously give him. But when the Bat fails to be grateful, his envy and pride will bring him to a disastrous outcome. This 7 the most traditional cut-out animation with all the advantages of the digital techniques. Making use of the director's cultural background and experience on Graphic Design, the production design is rendered in a very modern style, inspired on the ancient codices of Mexican cultures. With these colourful visuals and an entertaining narration, the film aims to appeal children and adults alike.
