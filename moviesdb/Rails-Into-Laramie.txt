Rails Into Laramie

 An army officer is sent to Laramie to find out why all progress on the railroad has stopped. He finds drink plentiful not only in town but at the railhead, with an old pal of his behind it all. It become obvious the two will tangle, but the soldier unexpectedly finds an ally in the ex-dance hall girl until now involved with the no-good booze peddler.
