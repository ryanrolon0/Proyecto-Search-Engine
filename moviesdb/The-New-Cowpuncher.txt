The New Cowpuncher

 The foreman has made up his mind to wed the employers daughter, and when a new hand is taken on he is disgusted to observe how quickly he makes his way into the good graces of everybody, including the girl. One day the sheriff tacks a notice up offering $500 reward for the capture of "the stranger," a well-known horse thief, whose description happens to be tally that of his rival. The foreman sees the possibility of ending the newcomer's pretensions to the girl's hand, and leading the latter's favorite horse out of the stable tethers it at a considerable distance from the ranch, and then tells the ranchowner that he has seen the new cowboy steal the horse. His action has been observed by the real horse-thief, who leads away the horse, and has it in his possession when he is captured by the sheriff. The foreman finds himself confronted by the Stranger, who tells him what he has seen, and the plotter is kicked out of the ranch, while his rival secures the father's consent to his marriage with the girl.
