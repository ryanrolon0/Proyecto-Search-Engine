The Last Days

 The year is 1945 and the Germans have just surrendered. An airborne unit is ordered to a nearby way-station to help process German surrenders. Along the way, they cross paths with a broken Werhmacht unit that's been cut off for days and does not know the war is officially over. With no translators in either group, they must overcome the language barrier before it's too late.
