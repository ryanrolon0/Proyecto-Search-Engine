The Canary

 Young deaf Lisa lives an isolated life with her mother in the Scottish highlands. When a man unexpectedly arrives, something in Lisa awakens. The Canary is a sensual exploration of emotional isolation and the need to express oneself. It is told without any spoken dialogue and shot on super8 film. Raw, lyrical and strangely atmospheric.
