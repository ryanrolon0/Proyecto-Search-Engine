Si Se Puede

 Hosted by Academy Award nominated actor Edward James Olmos (Blade Runner, Stand and Deliver, Battlestar Galactica), this documentary film chronicles the story of Roseland University Prep, a public charter school in Northern California, where minority students conquer seemingly insurmountable obstacles, poverty, gang warfare, shattered families, illegal immigrant status, and they win. They are determined warriors who will not accept what reality wants to hand them. Throughout the world today, brave young women and men fight their own weary wars with dignity and pride. The prize at RUP is both tactile, a simple diploma, and intangible, knowledge, that universal gift that cannot be taken away.
