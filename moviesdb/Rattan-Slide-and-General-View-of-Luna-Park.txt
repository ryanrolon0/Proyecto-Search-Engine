Rattan Slide and General View of Luna Park

 Here is fun fast and furious. A typical Coney Island scene, showing the boys and girls sliding down the winding rattan slide. Next follows a view of the miniature railway loaded with little ones and "grown-ups," too. After this is shown the beautiful cascade and boats going through the millrace, the picture concluding with a general panoramic view of the enormous crowds that frequent Luna Park. This film is full of action, and the photography is perfect.
