Sorciere, la vie

 Monique Mbeka Phoba, the director of the film, spent part of her childhood In Congo-Kinshasa, formerly known as Zaire, where witchcraft plays an integral part in people's lives. She then went to live in Belgium where she lost contact with certain specificities of her culture. Nevertheless, she was aware that her parents were still dependent upon this cultural belief system, from which they kept her and her brothers away. But, one day, Monique decided to answer to her questions by undertaking this journey back to her roots, guided by an 84-year old men accused to be a witch from his childhood. Ranging from the daily practices of witchcraft in Congo-Kinshasa to the frank discussions between Monique Mbeka Phoba and the people close to her, the film follows the rhythm of its maker's search.
