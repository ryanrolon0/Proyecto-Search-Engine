Proving Ground

 A teenage girl, accidentally left aboard a decommissioned starship finds herself engaged in a battle of wits against space pirates bent on stealing her ship. Meanwhile, her little brother struggles alone to survive the hostile elements on the planet below. HOLLISTON COLEMAN stars in the family sci-fi adventure PROVING GROUND THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN REDLOCKS, as Holly Stephenson, a girl who finds herself engaged in a battle of wits--and photon torpedoes!--with space pirates bent on seizing her starship, while her little brother (Bobby Coleman) struggles to survive on the hostile world below. Called "SPY KIDS meets STAR TREK" and answering the clarion call for truly excellent family movies, PROVING GROUND promises slam-bang, loud action and adventure, eye-popping special effects and excellent actors bringing to life characters you won't soon forget--and will have you screaming for more come the final credits! Written specifically for Miss Coleman, PROVING GROUND could be the next huge movie franchise...and could very well crown Holli herself as the next teen action star!
