Through the Negev

 This documentary gives voice to women and children not often represented in stories about Sudan. Told through interwoven first-person accounts by the few Sudanese women and children who have made the journey from Egypt to Israel, "Through the Negev" is a short documentary that encapsulates the refugees' struggle for home and safety. The women's intimate stories uncover the amazing strength and resiliency of women who just want a home.
