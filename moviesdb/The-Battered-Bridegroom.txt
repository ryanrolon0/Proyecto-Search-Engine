The Battered Bridegroom

 Kitty Benson, on the day of her betrothal, receives a message from her cousin, Jack Smith, stating that he and his fiancEe have run away from the paternal roof of opposition and will be married at once, and in the meantime asks that she lend her cousinly aid in hiding his lady love in her house until the minister can be arranged with. She arrives and receives the succor requested and is immediately followed by Jack, who shows his appreciation of her good services in good cousinly embraces. These marks of endearment are seen and of course misunderstood by Kitty's intended. Jealousy is invariably unreasonable and his is no exception to the general rule. Without waiting for explanations, he assaults Jack, who, surprised, retaliates, and the two men disappear from view, a heterogeneous mass of struggling legs and arms. When all their surplus energy has been spent, they creep back to their excited and almost hysterical sweethearts, very much the worse for wear, are repaired and bandaged by loving hands, and after a few necessary explanations, are glad to be friends and to give the minister an opportunity of earning a double marriage fee.
