The Big Party

 Kitty Collins and Flo Jenkins, a couple of jazz-age cuties with bobbed-hair and rolled-stockings, go in search of good-times and whoopee-making. The party they find also includes some out-of-town, butter-and-egg millionaires whose definition of whoopee is not the same as the one Kitty and Flo have. The wives of the millionaires also have a different-and-dim view on the matter.
