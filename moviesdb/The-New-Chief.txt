The New Chief

 The new Chief Superintendant of the Municipal Refuges, hearing of many abuses practiced in the system, decides to investigate. He disguises as a tramp. Refuga A is visited and the results are such that the refuge superintendant warns all down the line. In the meantime a real Weary Willie presents himself, and being mistaken for the new chief, is treated in grand style. When the chief enters and discloses his identity the Weary Willie is thrown in the street.
