The Coquette

 A young officer from a western regiment falls in love with a lady from San Francisco. He gives her his seal ring and she gives him a locket. Some months later he goes to the Phillipines with his regiment. The lady then meets an officer of a regiment from an eastern state, who becomes smitten with her. Acting as a free woman, she brought about a proposal from the second man, and in accepting him, gives him the ring presented to her by the first suitor. The two suitors are later engaged in the same skirmish with some Phillipines. The man from the western regiment is mortally wounded and dies in the arms of the man from the East. Before expiring, the easterner noticed the ring on the finger of the man in his arms. Questions brought everything to light. On returning to California the young easterner visited the girl. She advanced to meet him with a glad heart, but her happiness turned to remorse when he told her of having met the man she so basely wronged.
