Wandering Willies

 Two aimless wanderers are hungry and broke. They think of a way to trick a restaurant into giving them a free meal, but their scheme results in them being pursued by both the restaurant owner and the police. Soon, however, they discover that the restaurant owner has a secret of his own, and the tables are turned.
