Seagrasses

 Seagrasses in New Hampshire form a little-known but important marine ecosystem. It is estimated that we have lost at least 50% of the original seagrass area along the mainland coastlines of the United States. Worldwide, seagrasses thrive in remote areas but are often impacted or even eliminated by a variety of human activities from shoreline development to aquaculture practices. The complex and productive seagrass habitat, however, is vital to a healthy ocean. Currently, eleven species of seahorse are endangered and seagrass habitat loss is partly responsible. Sea turtles and sea mammals are similarly threatened or endangered. Pollution reduction, a decrease in direct impacts, and establishment of marine protected areas are all actions that can be taken to reverse the global trend of seagrass loss. These potential human interventions will begin to protect these valuable and imperiled ecosystems and ensure that marine species and their habitat endure and thrive. Through this high definition short video, the audience will discover the secret life within seagrasses and be inspired to become their stewards.
