The year is 1995, and you are reporter Carl Denning, for a TV forensic program, "Case Unsolved." Your producer, Robin Morales, has been kidnapped by Henry Stauf mysteriously, and a laptop called the GameBook has been delivered by Stauf, and you drive over to Stauf's mansion to rescue her. You're the only one who can save her. But in order to save her, you need to figure out all of Stauf's brainteaser puzzles and mostly anagrammed riddles.
