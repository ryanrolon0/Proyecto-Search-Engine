The Mummy

 Centuries ago, the evil Emperor Han was cursed by the sorceress Zi Yuan who transformed him and his army into a mummies. In 1946, the explorer Rick O'Connell and his wife Evelyn O'Connell are invited by the British government to take the relic diamond "The Eye of Shangri-La" to China. The ancient stone is capable of resurrecting the Emperor Han and of pointing the way to Shangri-La and the eternal pool of life. When the couple reaches China, they meet their son Alex O'Connell, who has discovered the tomb of Han, and Evelyn's brother Jonathan Carnahan. The O'Connells are betrayed by their friend Prof. Roger Wilson, who is associated with General Yang. Yang wants to serve Emperor Han, so he resurrects the mummy and they head for Shangri-La. The guardian of Han's tomb (and Zi's daughter) Lin tells them that the only ways to destroy Han is to prevent him from reaching Shangri-La or by stabbing his heart with a cursed dagger. It's 1946 and Jack and Evie are now retired. They did a bit of espionage during World War II but have decided it's now the easy life for them. The only problem is that they are now quite bored so they jump at the chance to deliver a precious gem which the UK government is returning to China. Evie's brother Jonathan is now running a nightclub in Shanghai and they are surprised to also find their son Alex who is supposed to be at university but has on an archaeological dig with an old friend, Professor Roger Wilson. They soon find themselves involved in intrigue as a corrupt Chinese General needs the gem to resurrect Emperor Han and his army who have been dead for thousands of years.
