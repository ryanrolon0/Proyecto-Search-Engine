The Colours of Exile

 The Colours of Exile is a half-hour documentary about the life and art of renowned Canadian/Palestinian artist, Amin Shammout. Shammout was 14 years old when he and his family, along with tens of thousands of other Palestinians, were forced from their homes during the 1948 expulsion carried out by the Israelis. He spent 60 years searching for a home and an identity, a lifetime of migration that took him to Egypt, Kuwait, Austria, and Canada. Through Amin's narration, the film excavates his canvases in search of a visceral meaning for exile and homeland; illustrating the role of memory and how artistic production becomes a manifestation of personal and cultural experience.
