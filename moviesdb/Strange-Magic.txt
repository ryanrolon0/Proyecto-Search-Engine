Strange Magic

 Director Michael Raven spins a wicked tale of a young, over-sexed woman whose appetite for lust and decadence drives her to dabble with things best left alone. Gina Ryder stars as a naughty young witch who uses her powers to seduce and control and sexually devour all who cross her path... from the innocent to the decadent to the bizarre, Gina's uncontrollable hunger for wet, hot flesh consumed all who fell under her wicked spell.
