Rhythm Inn

 A bandleader, desperate to get his band's instruments out of hock, promises the pawnshop clerk--an aspiring songwriter--that he'll let the band's female singer do the clerk's songs at a local club if he will let the band "borrow" their instruments at night. The clerk's girlfriend, however, thinks that the band singer is after more than her boyfriend's songs. Band leader Dusty Rhodes and his combo are in trouble with the local constabulary and are forced to put up their musical instruments in a music store as security for a loan to pay a fine. But, in order for the group to fulfill their commitment at the "Rhythm Inn", the band's singer, Carol Denton, prevails upon Eddie Thompson, who works at the store and is an amateur songwriter, to smuggle the instruments to the band each night without his employer's knowledge. Eddie's girlfriend, Betty Parker, misunderstands the relationship between Eddie and Carol, and complications arise.
