Pyaar Ka Saagar

 After the passing of their parents Bombay-based Bishen Chand Gupta takes it upon himself to raise his younger brother, Kishen. He arranges for his education in Ahmedabad. While Kishen is holidaying in Mahabaleshwar, the bus they are traveling in, breaks down due to a storm, and the passengers are stranded. Kishen comes to the assistance of fellow-passenger, Radha, and both eventually and passionately fall in love with each other. As Radha's birthday is on the 20th of that month, Kishen purchases a statuette of Lord Kishan and Goddess Radha, symbolizing their love for each other, as a present for Radha. It is then her Bua tells him that Radha has been married. A shocked and devastated Kishen falls down the stairs, is injured, and loses his vision. He recuperates and goes back to Bombay to live with his brother, who is now married to a woman named Rani. Kishen does not know that Rani is none other than Radha, who is refusing to reveal her real name to Kishen. Watch what happens when Bishen asks her to convince Kishen to undergo eye surgery to restore his vision. Will Radha convince him, and if he regains his sight, how will the two adjust to living under the same roof?
