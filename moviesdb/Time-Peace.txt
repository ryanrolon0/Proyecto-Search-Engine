Time Peace

 Time Peace is an experimental film investigating the application of extreme temporal distortion to a recognizable visceral event. Using stock footage of the Twin Towers, taken on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, this stationary video recording has been slowed down to 6 percent of its normal speed. The original 30 second clip is now extended to over 9 minutes in length. Juxtaposed with an evocative soundtrack, the replaying of the horrific explosion and burning aftermath at a rate of almost one frame per second transforms this shocking incident into a hypnotic viewing experience that attempts to both reinterpret and reinforce the emotional impact of the 9-11 attacks on New York City.
