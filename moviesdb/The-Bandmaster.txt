The Bandmaster

 Andy Panda goes to the circus, and the circus turns into a circus where a girl aerialist is rescued by her own false teeth; the acrobats and jugglers mangle each other; a girl trapeze artist loses her wig as a rope-spinning act goes haywire; and the drunken high-wire walker finds himself surrounded by pink elephants.
