The Seattle Pilots

 This film traces the history of major league baseball's one year team, the Seattle Pilots, who after their lone season of 1969 were moved to Milwaukee and became the Brewers. Through interviews with players, front office staff and Pilots historians we get a glimpse into the close-knit and hysterical world of the Pilots, a team already made famous by Jim Bouton's highly influential and controversial book 'Ball Four'. Mr. Bouton and a dozen other payers give their recollections, share their stories and give us a hint as to why the Pilots are still so beloved after all this time.
