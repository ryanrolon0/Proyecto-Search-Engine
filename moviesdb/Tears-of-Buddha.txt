Tears of Buddha

 In the fall of 1972, director Elliott Hong and cinematographer Russ Kingston traveled for a month throughout South Korea shooting folk art festivals, competitive games (including the Korean National Olympics), religious ceremonies and ancient shrines. The film contrasts modern city life with the traditional values of farms and villages.
