The Deadly Look of Love

 Janet Flanders is swept off her feet when dashing businessman Brett Becker's sports-car nearly runs her over. In no time the dream prince becomes her adored lover, without promising her anything. After Janet's adulterous former lover, Jerry Singleton, discloses that he only asked Brett to get her off his back, Jerry perishes in a fire. Janet follows Brett to Chicago. Shortly after Brett ends their affair announcing his impending wedding to heiress Kathleen Murdock, the newly-wed is viciously slashed in their new home.
