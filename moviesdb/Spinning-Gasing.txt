Spinning Gasing

 Harry Lee returns home to Malaysia from overseas studies. He has failed everything and is kicked out of home by his father, a disgrace. He forms a dance band with Yati, his childhood friend. Harry is Chinese by race and does not believe in god. Yati is a modern Malay and Muslim who believes in her heritage and religion. The five members of this band (Malay, Chinese, Indian and Eurasian) represent the multi-racial nature of Malaysian society, and English is their common language. The band members are forced to flee Kuala Lumpur, the capital city, when the loan sharks demand repayment of a debt. They flee to the picturesque East Coast, where traditions and myths still hold strong amongst the villagers and fishermen. They are in familiar yet disturbing territory, and their hip and modern dance music blends with the magical folk songs of an old culture. Away from the pressures of urban life, Yati and Harry's childhood crush develops into something much stronger, a love that crosses racial and religious boundaries. Harry and Yati are forced to resolve personal issues of love and betrayal, race and religion.
