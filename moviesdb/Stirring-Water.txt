Stirring Water

 According to Jean Marc Bazil, interpreter, tour guide and self-proclaimed Haitian Sensation, the Haitians have a proverb that says, "I stir water to make butter." With that begins a poetic excursion into the heart of the tumult that is life in present-day Haiti. Employing elements of classic newsreel style, silent era inter-titling, and a bold sound-scape of field recordings, director John Kamys assembles a compelling and thoughtful modern travelogue of the poorest country in the western hemisphere.
