Small, Stupid, and Insignificant

 A short film that explores euthanasia and assisted suicide. The narrative centers on Marie, a woman in her thirties who is struggling with the decision to 'pull the plug' on her sister Magda, who has been in a coma for an extended period. Marie is haunted by Magda, who appears to her in various forms and pleads with Marie to give consent to end her life. In contrast, Marie's mother, Giovanna, considers any intervention that would hasten Magda's death to be tantamount to murder. Interspersed with the story is documentary footage of people answering the question, 'What does it mean to be alive?'projected onto our set. Marie ultimately escapes her torment with the help of a mysterious character who helps her choose for herself and her sister.
