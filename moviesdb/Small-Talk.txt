Small Talk

 Eva, a seven year old mute girl, communicates via pre-recorded tapes played on a clunky tape deck which hangs round her neck on a rope. When her crippled father's physiotherapist, Maggie, is set to walk out of their lives forever, it comes down to Eva to get the floundering lovers past the small talk stage before it is too late. A story about communication breakdown told through the imaginative mind of a wily young girl.
