She Will Never Know

 The old adage of "Be sure your sin will find you out," is well exemplified in this drama of the life of Gracia Snow, whose father, in his effort to acquire wealth becomes an incendiary. His crime is detected - he deserts his child and leaves for parts unknown. A guilty conscience gives him no rest and he becomes a knight of the road. In later years he comes back to his old home under adverse circumstances. His identity becomes known, through a misdeed, but only to the lover of his daughter. Pride will not permit him to face the girl he took in her infancy and he continues his aimless wanderings. The news of the father's return was the basis of a surprise for the daughter, but when the lover finds the man has again left he keeps the secret to himself and the already disgraced daughter never knew to what depths her wayward father had fallen.
