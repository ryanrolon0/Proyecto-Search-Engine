Prelude to the Mythos

 The story revolves around two good friends - Adam and Tyler. Adam is having dreams/visions of a redheaded woman that seems very familiar to him, but not in this life. Tyler seems to know more about the dreams than Adam and is convinced he and Adam knew each other billions of years ago before there was an Earth. All the while Adam is dealing with chest pains and his girlfriend is trying to anchor him down to some sense of normality. Adam's visions only grow more intense taking a toll on his sanity, but they start to trigger memories of who and what he used to be...although the question remains area any of these memories true, or just illusions?
