The Bare Necessities

 While "The Full Monthy" was a one-off stunt in the film of that name, here a self-organized group of unemployed miners from the industrial wasteland of northern England make it their profession to tour the country by bus, and perform in Chippendales-style, both individually and together in a grand finale. The physical selection may be less strict and the training more rudimentary, they have enough British stage flair to make their all-female audience go absolutely wild with sexual excitement, most of them especially for Tony, the 'baby' of the bunch. There's also backstage scenes, right into their shower, and the business side of the enterprise.
