The Elephant's Egg

 Joe has a Zippo lighter engraved with a Praying Mantis by Salvador Dali. It was given to him by his recent ex-gal, Leyla. One night, after Joe has a drunken heart-to-heart with his dog, Ptolemy, he discovers that he still loves Leyla and that he wishes to have her back. Coincidentally, he also discovers that the lighter contains a Hippopotamus Genie who is willing to grant his wish. The Hippo of the Zippo tells him that in order to get the girl, he must enter the underworld and break the Elephant's Egg at the Sparkling Sea. So Joe and Ptolemy set off on a journey through a Dali painting to win back the girl.
