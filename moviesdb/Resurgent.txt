Resurgent

 A mentally wounded soldier finds himself out of his realm back in the United States. Driven by guilt and the horrors of combat he begins to recount his experience through audio journaling. This documentation leads him into the search for the power he once knew. The path to rediscovering himself takes a deadly turn as the past rapidly blends with the present.
