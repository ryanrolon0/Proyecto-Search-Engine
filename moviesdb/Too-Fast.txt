Too Fast

 Inspired by 'The Art of War' by Sun Tzu. 'Too Fast' follows a spy (Sean) on the day he decides to resign. Using age old military tactics and philosophies usually saved for large scale warfare, Sean recalls and applies the knowledge to his current predicament. Having nowhere else to turn to, Sean is chased by a relentless agency assassin throughout a barrio in LA. Each turn, movement, and breath could be his last.
