Ripe

 'Ripe' kicks off and for the next 12 minutes we are bouncing inside Sami's brain. Our neurotic, cheeky, fresh-out-of-art-school protagonist keeps herself busy focusing on what she should be doing in order to achieve happiness while her boyfriend Nate seems to float through life with endless ease. With only her over-analytical/ under-stimulated psyche to guide her, 'Ripe' follows Sami on her typical day through the trenches of L.A (the magnetic streets of Echo Park, yuppie coffee houses, Hollywood, bleak NoHo Production Offices, and back again). 'Ripe' documents a life we've all lived at one point or another.
