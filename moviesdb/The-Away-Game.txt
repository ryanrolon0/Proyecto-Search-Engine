The Away Game

 Explores what it's really like to be an Australian footballer playing in the top leagues of Europe. This documentary is an intimate and energetic collection of observations that capture the emotion and personality of Australia's most high-profile footballers, as well as those at clubs you've never heard of, who are simply doing what they love, albeit thousands of kilometers from home, like young South Australian Hayden Doyle, a 17-year-old apprentice at Stoke City who spends his afternoons scrubbing clean Josip Skoko's boots. From an emotional interview with Graham Arnold to having a kick around with Luca, Skoko's son, the The Away Game crew capture our national heroes in intimate and unique settings John Aloisi and his family in Vitoria, Spain, giving Tim Cahill a run for his money on the PlayStation, discussing the wonders of cooking on the run with Harry Kewell and planning an Aussie BBQ in the Tuscan countryside with Vince Grella. Takes viewers inside the dressing rooms, into the back-room offices and player's front doors to bring you the reality of professional football in Europe, told by Australian players. For the first time ever, they will tell us what their lives and loves are really like - in their own words, at their own clubs, in their own homes.
