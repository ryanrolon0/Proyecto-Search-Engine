Pro Wrestling

 Pro Wrestling is a generic wrestling game (i.e. it has no "pro" license such as WCW, WWF, or ECW), featuring a roster of 6 wrestlers, including Starman, The Amazon, and Kin Corn Karn. You wrestle your way through the ranks of the Video Wrestling Alliance, until you win the VWA World title. You then must defend the title enough times to be granted a shot at the World title of another wrestling fed.
