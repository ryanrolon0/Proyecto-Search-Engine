Unconditional

 It's been a year since camera crews were allowed into the home of Michael Foster and Brian Patterson, a homosexual couple celebrating their life together by having a commitment ceremony right in their own back yard. 'Unconditional' explores the lives of these two men and the friends and family they share over the course of two days in Sanford, Florida and sheds light on the one thing no law passed can prevent... unconditional love. Featuring music from top 40 GLBT artist Rachel Sage and alternative folk musician Harold Crisman, this is the first professional documentary release from director/editor Gabriel Haze since his graduation from college in February of 2010. His first two music video releases in 2009, Dagnese's 'Come Over After' and Elizabeth June's 'Freedom', together have won 40+ awards and official selections worldwide.
