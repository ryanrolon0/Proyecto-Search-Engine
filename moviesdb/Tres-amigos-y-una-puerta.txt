Tres amigos y una puerta

 We open up on three men in a dank, mysterious room with a single door. It's dark and we are unsure why they are there. As the three talk about escape, the topic of the men who used to occupy the room comes up. As their conversation progresses we learn the truth about the occupants and the room with the door.
