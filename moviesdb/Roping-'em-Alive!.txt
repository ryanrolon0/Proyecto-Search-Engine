Roping 'em Alive!

 A Vitaphone Variety jungle short with edited footage from a couple of different safaris and animal-hunting expeditions. The first segment is comprised a visit to the Masawi tribe in Africa, where the natives have a passion for wire ornaments, with which they lavishly wear on themselves. The second half is about a party of animal trappers, in the Malay States of southeastern Africa. Since the goal is to bring the animals back alive, for zoos all over the world, the capturing method employed is most often lassos and ropes. The hunter/trappers aren't above setting the forest afire in order to bring the animals and wildlife to a spot where they can be more easily captured.
