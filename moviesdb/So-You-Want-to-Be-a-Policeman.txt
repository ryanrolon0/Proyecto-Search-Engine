So You Want to Be a Policeman

 Joe McDoakes is a shy, rookie motorcycle cop. The first traffic violator he stops is a tough character and intimidates Joe out of giving him a ticket, and the next is a beautiful blonde who has no trouble distracting Joe and avoiding a ticket. Joe decides to be tough on the next one he stops, which turns out to be the police commissioner. Joe is removed from the force, and is caught speeding and given a ticket.
