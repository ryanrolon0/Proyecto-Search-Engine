Substitute

 A stunning stretch of golden sand. The beach is deserted except for an odd looking shape half way up the beach. A beached whale? When Jimmy, a nine-year-old boy trips over it whilst flying a kite, he thinks he's discovered a dead body. But then the mysterious man stirs and a battle of wits begins as the boy must try and save him from the tide. Not easy when the man is twice his size and has gone there to die.  This determined little kid doesn't know it yet but he's just stumbled on his greatest hero. Now all Jimmy's got to do is trick him to his feet. That and give this brutish, has-been of a man a reason to live.
