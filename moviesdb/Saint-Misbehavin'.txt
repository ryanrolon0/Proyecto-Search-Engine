Saint Misbehavin'

 Wavy Gravy is known as the MC of the Woodstock festival, a hippie icon, activist, clown, and even a Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor. In SAINT MISBEHAVIN' we meet a true servant to humanity who carries his message through humor, compassion and a song he wrote called "Basic Human Needs". SAINT MISBEHAVIN' weaves together intimate vEritE footage, reflections from an array of cultural and counter-cultural peers, and a rich collection of never-before-seen archival footage to tell a story that is bigger than the man himself.
