 A young filmmaker falls asleep trying to come up with ideas for his latest film. In his dream, we see two sock puppets who fall in love at first sight. But the evil man will have no part in such happiness and takes the girl away. Now the boy must save her and rid the evil man of their presence all before the filmmaker awakes.
