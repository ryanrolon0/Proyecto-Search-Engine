Untitled Emile Griffith Project

 A dramatization of welterweight boxer Emile Griffith's life-altering match with Benny "Kid" Paret. The two men squared off on March 24, 1962, and Griffith, who was baited by Paret before the bout, went on to batter his opponent unconscious. Paret died of his injuries 10 days later at the age of 25.
