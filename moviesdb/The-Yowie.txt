The Yowie

 Bill Walker, a Blue Mountains shop owner, is in crisis. His wife Marge has died and his artistic son Kevin is immature and dependent. Their tourist cafe is failing. He forces Kevin into a Chewbacca suit and gets him to run across the road in the surrounding national park to fake a Yowie. It works brilliantly, though Kevin is at first very reluctant. Tourists pour into Bill's shop and buy his Yowie gear. but local thugs decide they'll catch or kill the Yowie, and the local Aboriginal Park Ranger, Geraldine, a personal friend, is also getting suspicious. Things go horribly wrong. and with the possibility of real menace lurking in the bushland, will Bill and Kevin find better solutions to their grief than faking..The Yowie??
