 A mix of stand-up comedy and sketches, notable for its mixing of live action and computer animation. The "premise" is that a young boy is watching the show on a strange CD that his mom bought. Sketches include "Glass Booth Guy" in which a gas station clerk mocks people from his bullet-proof glass box and a sketch in which a woman is trying to break up with her weird boyfriend (he's a skeleton). The undisputed highlight is "OEDEBATTLE", a parody of Mortal Kombat-style games. In it, the young boy tries to defeat Steve's muscle-bound character; unfortunately, the characters he gets to choose from are "Accountant," "Sick Old Woman," "Little Girl," "Puppy" and "HerbaPet."
