Tea & Sympathy

 Fred's a man on the edge - quite literally. When his wife ups and leaves him for another, Fred decides to end it all by leaping off a roof. But before he jumps he makes one last cry for help, and calls Brian, a charity worker whose job it is to save lives. But Brian's got problems of his own - an auntie with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a broken toilet, and a plumber who's left him in the lurch. In their own very different ways, these two men are about to reach boiling point. But could Brian's nosy colleague have the answer to all their problems - in the shape of a nice, hot, cup of tea?
