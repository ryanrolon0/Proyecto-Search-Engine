Voice Teacher

 Don Roberts is a construction worker, only he doesn't build buildings, he build's throats. Singers of all stripes regularly attend his studio in Oneonta, NY, but rarely in person. Don teaches over the telephone; a bizarre and controversial approach. Day after day, Don teaches voice to world-renowned cantors and up-and-coming opera singers. But to enter this particular studio, pupils must embrace the psyche behind the training. Don will go to great, sometimes outrageous lengths to enforce the doctrine that voice teaching is a sacred, existential journey and not just a random seesaw of back and forth singing. Voice Teacher is a psychological profile of a man who has dedicated most of his adult life to facilitating the human voice. We explore how his roots in the Synagogue drove him to become both a cantor and rabbi, where he combined artistic singing with religious purpose. Another crucial thread in this exploration is the component of Don's family-life and we are introduced to his wife and children. Ultimately, we are guided through the sometimes rough, yet exhilarating maze of Don Roberts by a diverse group of students; each of whom have gone through the proverbial cauldron. Don is obsessive, neurotic, at times harsh and always engaging. This feature-length documentary catapults you inside his hyperactive existence.
