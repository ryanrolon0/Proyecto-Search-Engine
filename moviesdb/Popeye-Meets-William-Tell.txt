Popeye Meets William Tell

 William fires an arrow, barely missing Popeye; then tells Popeye that he has just lost his son in an unfortunate arrow incident (the picture of his son is 'Groucho Marx' (qv)). Tell then defies the king and is ordered to shoot an apple off his son's head; Popeye stands in for his son. The arrow goes astray, but it hits Popeye's can of spinach.
