Trolley Dances

 Trolley Dances invigorates the built environment with movement, rhythm and emotion - challenging viewers to see the cityscape afresh. Trolley Dances is much more than a record of six original site-specific dance performances. The special energy of this event comes from interaction of artists immersed in the community. The documentary takes a behind the scenes look at the months long process of creation.
