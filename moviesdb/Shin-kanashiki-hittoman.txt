Shin kanashiki hittoman

 Tachibana is a mob hit man, just released from 10 years in prison where he kicked his drug habit. He's dismayed to find that the code of conduct he honors no longer counts, and soon gets into trouble when he defends a call girl, Yuki, from a pimp who is connected to another gang. Running drugs is where all the action is, and Tachibana scorns junkies and pushers. Can Tachibana navigate this new world, protect Yuki and help her quit drugs, counsel his acolyte, stay true to his code, and maybe find a way out of the gang?
