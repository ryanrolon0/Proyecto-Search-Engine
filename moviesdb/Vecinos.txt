Vecinos

 One evening in Buenos Aires, Ari, without shirt or shoes, rings his neighbor's doorbell the phone. His neighbor is Ema, in her 50s, 25 years his senior. She makes coffee and gets a shawl for his shoulders; she asks if he'll wait to use the phone until after she receives an expected call. He eventually realizes that her phone is out of service and asks to borrow coins to make calls from a pay phone. She's lonely, caught between erotic and maternal feelings. She loans him clothes and asks him to pick up some coffee. Outside, he makes several calls. She weeps. Have they made a connection?
