The Virgin of Tijuana

 20,000 are being trafficked into the United States every year. When they get to the States they are for sale. Many girls as young as 14. Zero's sister is one of the girls being sold unless he can find her before it's too late. He must use every connection he has to find her. But the odds are against him and the law can't offer any help. He must take matters into his own hands even if it means killing his friends to find her.
