The Defilers

 Carl Walker Jr, and Jameison Marsh are two wealthy and spoiled young men whom date and degrate women just for their own twisted, misogynist enjoyment. When men spot Jane Collins, a young and naive newcomer to Los Angeles, they kidnap her from her apartment and hold her prisoner in the dark and damp basement of an abandoned warehouse where they take out their carnal desires and rages against this beautiful, blond, defenseless woman.
