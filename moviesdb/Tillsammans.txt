Tillsammans

 Elisabeth tires of her husband Rolf, so she packs her bags, takes the kids and goes to her brother Göran. The year is 1975 and Göran lives in a commune called Together. Living in this leftist commune are people between the ages of 25 and 35, along with their children. It is there where most of the film takes place, and there where things happen that affect not only the extended family members, but a few more... In 1975, in Stockholm, the housewife Elisabeth gets tired of her abusive and drunken husband Rolf, and she moves with her teenager daughter Eva and her young son Stefan to the hippie community where her brother Göran lives. Goran is a good man, who has an open relationship with his mate Lena, but does not feel comfortable with the situation. They are welcomed by the group composed of a new-lesbian Anna, her "almost gay" husband and their children; a gay; and an idealist communist. Eva becomes friend of her neighbor Fredrik, and with the new-arrivals in the commune, lives of the members change. Meanwhile, Rolf misses Elizabeth and his family, stops drinking and tries to approach to Elizabeth again.
