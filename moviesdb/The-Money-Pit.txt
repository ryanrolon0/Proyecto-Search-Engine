The Money Pit

 Walter Fielding and Anna Crowley have to start looking for a new house- but there's not much they can afford! This soon changes when they meet a lonely old con-artist who sells them a beautiful mansion at a ridiculously low price. Only there's a catch. The second Walter and Anna move in to the house it falls apart, starting from the stairway, to the bath falling through the roof to eventually the chimney falling into the house! Finally, they have to renovate the house before the frame collapses but the renovations also prove to be a disaster. Walter and Anna want a home of their own. When Walter's real estate agent friend offers him what looks like the perfect home, Anna and Walter buy it. The house has many problems; structural, plumbing, electrical... These problems only come to light after they've moved in. Hence, the house is a 'money pit'. Also worthy of note are the comical builders and the terrible ex husband, Max, who still chases Anna. A young couple sinks their life savings into a house that is falling apart to the extent that it no longer has a main stairway or water. This creates strains on their relationship. Every home owner will recognize some of the situations they encounter.
