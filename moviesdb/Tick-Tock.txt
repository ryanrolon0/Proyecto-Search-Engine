Tick Tock

 "Tick Tock" is the story about a mysterious antique gypsy pendant watch that warns the wearer when they have only 13 minutes to live. Just enough time to pray, say goodbye to loved ones, repent your sins and save your soul ... or not. Late one night in a quiet New England home, Jane Taylor sits down to watch TV like any other night. Little does she know that she's about to suffer a fatal heart attack. Tick Tock, Tick Tock, the pendant watch ticks the precious minutes away. Will Jane remember the curse of the watch before it's too late? Will she repent her sins or will Evil take her soul? After the funeral, family and friends gather at the TAYLOR home to remember Jane and comfort each other in their grief, but it doesn't take long before dysfunction takes over and the obnoxious sister-in-law Lizzt schemes to get her hands on the gold pendant watch.
