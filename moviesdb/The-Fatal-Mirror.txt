The Fatal Mirror

 Pretty Jessie Brown, living alone with her brother in the mountains, knew no luxuries; so when Bob brought a mirror from town, her joy knew no bounds. Nor was her grief the less when it was broken. Bob posted a sign directed against sheepmen that day and was shot. Jessie, in revenge, shot his murderer, not seeing an outlaw in the bushes close by. When the posse came to get her the woods echoed with two shots. The posse captured the outlaw, who, when asked if he killed the catteman, nodded and smiled.
