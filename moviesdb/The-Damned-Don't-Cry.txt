The Damned Don't Cry

 The Joan Crawford crime thriller, _The Damned Don't Cry (1950)_ (qv), is the topic of discussion for various interviewees, which include the film's director, Vincent Sherman. The film's story was loosely based on Bugsy Siegel's real-life gun moll, Virginia Hill. The producer, Jerry Wald, who came out of journalism, was naturally attracted to the script's sensationalism. The interviewees discuss the brisk pace and snappy dialogue, a common feature of Warner Bros. pictures during the Golden Age. They explain why Joan Crawford's character was a mirror image of the actress's own life and why the character uses sex to get what she wants. And they explain why they aren't talking about a film with Joan Crawford; they're talking about a Joan Crawford film.
