The Night of the Moon Has Many Hours

 The film tells the story of a young man, living in the country side, whose nightly ritual consists in recovering bodies from a river and returning them to their mourners. We see him sailing away on his boat and picking his catch along a moonlit path. As he ventures outdoors nature's presence is sensed in a heightened manner and an impenetrable darkness overtake the viewer's aural and visual fields. All these natural elements work together increasing the sense of awe and mystery surrounding this young man's ritual.
