Viola

 Stumbling on slippery moss at the 4 o'clock bus stop, seven-year-old Viola steps outside her own world to reach out for an adventure. She feels like a giant, a tiny lumbering giant. Teetering on too small shoes. Isolated. A thousand people on paths that never touch. Until she meets another giant.
