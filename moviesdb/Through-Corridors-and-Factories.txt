Through Corridors and Factories

 Through Corridors and Factories explores abandoned sites around a small town on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. As seen through the curious eyes of a 10 year-old girl, the derelict landscape of domesticity, luxury, and industry not only presents an opportunity to explore, it also raises questions about an outsider's ability to truly understand the history of another place.
