Roamer

 In the future, after a biological weapon has left the human population ravaged and infected, 072, a mercenary and father, patrols the outskirts of the boarders between the remains of civilization and the region that surrounds them. His objective is the elimination of the infected. One morning, he follows an infected 'roamer' into his hideout and discovers something that will change his life, and the only possible way to save whatever humanity is left.
