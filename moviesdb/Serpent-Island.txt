Serpent Island

 An office secretary from Scranton, Pennsylvania (Rosalind Hayes) sets out to find her great-grandfather's hidden treasure. She enlists the aid of a former Marine Engineer turned harbor bum (Sonny Tufts) and the greedy Captain (Tom Monroe) of the sea ship "Constellation". They find the gold hidden on an island near Haite, but it's guarded by a voodoo cult and a boa constrictor.
