Soar

 Simon, an actor whose new show has just opened, is taking a quick plane trip for an audition for a sit com. The man sitting next to him on the plane recognizes him, having seen Simon's new show. The man is talkative, effusive, and, during the flight, insinuates himself into Simon's well-being. How will Simon respond to this change in cabin pressure?
