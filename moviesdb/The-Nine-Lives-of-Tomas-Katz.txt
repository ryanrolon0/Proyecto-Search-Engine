The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz

 The last day of creation. A stranger arrives in London. No one knows who he is or where he has come from. By the time he leaves, the entire universe will have been erased. A black comedy about the Apocalypse, 'The Nine Lives...' presents a unique brand of left-field humour, spiritual beauty and spectral horror.
