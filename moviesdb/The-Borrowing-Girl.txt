The Borrowing Girl

 The action takes place in front of a set constructed of canvas painted to resemble the boudoir of a young woman. As the first scene begins, a young lady is sitting on the edge of a bed, while another is at a sewing machine. The door opens and another young lady in pajamas comes in. She borrows something in a bottle and walks out. As soon as she is off camera, the two young girls take a toilet water bottle from a dressing table, fill it full of ink and put it back. The door of set opens and the same pajama-clad girl returns, picks up the bottle of toilet water to shake on herself. The ink comes out all over her pajama front. The scene ends as she leaves in anger.
