The Moviemakers

 The creative team behind the movie _Wild Rovers (1971)_ (qv) try to recreate the true substance of what it means to be a cowboy in the American west in the late 19th century. The movie stars 'William Holden (I)' (qv) and 'Ryan O'Neal' (qv) as two cowboys at different stages of their lives, but who come to the same realization about being a cowboy based on the older of the two's experience. Director 'Blake Edwards (I)' (qv) changes the nature of a scene based on what Mother Nature has provided him. It is a physical and taxing shoot, even for the younger O'Neal, but the filmmakers have at their disposal modern technological conveniences, such as helicopters, their use juxtaposed against the rugged scenery which evokes older times. Different moods are created depending on where they are filming, the different locations including a recreated western town, interiors in a saloon for an intentionally claustrophobic feeling poker game, the wide open desert and the magnificence of Monument Valley. Holden discusses working with Edwards, who appears to be lackadaisical, a facade in Holden's mind to make the actors more at ease and feel more involved in the film-making process. This is a short promotional film for the feature film _Wild Rovers (1971)_ (qv). It highlights the location shooting of two outdoor scenes filmed in Utah's Monument Valley, and a bank robbery scene. Director 'Blake Edwards' (qv) and star 'William Holden (I)' (qv) comment on the production.
