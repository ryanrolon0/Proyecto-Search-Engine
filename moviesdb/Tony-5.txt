Tony 5

 Set in the "Cock & Bull" British Pub and along the streets of Santa Monica, California, we follow Londoner Tony Churchill carving out his slice of "The American Dream" as he starts to build his empire around "Churchill's Multipurpose Cleaning Product." However, his nightmare from the past, Maguire, discovers his whereabouts and the dread of meeting him again is only a matter of days away.
