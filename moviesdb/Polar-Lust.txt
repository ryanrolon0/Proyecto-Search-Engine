Polar Lust

 This animated short asks and answers a mysterious question vast, chilly Arctic, of what does a sleeping polar bear dream? It turns out that this bear, the coolest of the cool, dreams of playing the baritone saxophone, fronting a jazz quartet at a club called the Cool Note. As they play "Polar Lust in F Major," the bear spins and pirouettes weightlessly through an ethereal cityscape before waking on the frozen white bedsheet of his Arctic home.
