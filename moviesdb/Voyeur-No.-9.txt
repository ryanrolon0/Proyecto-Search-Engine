Voyeur No. 9

 Voyeur No. 9 is a slide show experiment initiated by the camera lens and the participants of the test. Each slide shows a brief glimpse of a person's world. The subject matter is out of focus but exposed nonetheless. It is a test of endurance in the human need for sensation stimulation and satisfaction of the retina. What will the eye make out in the sea of celluloid? In the end, the story behind the slide show is the fact that we are all voyeurs.
