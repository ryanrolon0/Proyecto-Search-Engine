Team O'Hara

 Acclaimed L.A. based sketch comedy group, "The Printers' Daughters", brings you their most recent foray into sublime wackiness. Told in mockumentary style, "Team O' Hara" focuses on Deb and Carla and the characters they come into contact with as they comb L.A. in search of their idol, Catherine O'Hara.
