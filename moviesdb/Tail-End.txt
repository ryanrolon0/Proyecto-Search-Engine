Tail End

 A story of the outcast dogs NYC's East Side. They live in the dog slums, and are trying to get some of the bones the fat bulldog has piled up in his yard, but the bulldog is too watchful. Along comes Clarence the lap dog, a snooty little aristocrat, who wants to pal with them. They give him a cold shoulder until he shows them the trick of getting the bones from the bulldog. In fact, he gets all the bones from the bulldog. Then the two outcasts recognize the fact that Clarence is a genius and a born leader an accept him as such.
