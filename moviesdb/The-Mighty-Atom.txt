The Mighty Atom

 Boy cadet fetches help when British regiment is under siege on the North West Frontier. Jim pleads to be allowed to join his father's regiment, who are embarking for duty overseas, but he must stay behind with his weeping mother. He absconds and stows away on board the ship. During the voyage, he is discovered and brought before the colonel, who summons the boy's father, Sergeant Clary, and tells him to let his son enlist. Once on duty, the regiment is besieged in a fort by hostile hill tribes. Sergeant Clary is wounded, and his son, the drummer boy, is sent to summon help. Hotly pursued over rough country by some tribesmen, whom he shoots, he reaches a British camp, despite being wounded. A relief contingent sets off and puts the tribesmen to flight with cannon fire.
