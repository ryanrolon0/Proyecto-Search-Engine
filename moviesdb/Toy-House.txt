Toy House

 A young boy is inspecting an abandoned carnival one night when it is suddenly lured through the gates by an entrancing pixie. It leads the boy through the dark and mysterious carnival grounds and eventually the boy finds a massive playhouse. Once inside, curiosity overtakes caution and the boy climbs into the main attraction. It is a huge Ferris-wheel with a kind face. And after rotating slowly and lulling the boy to sleep, the Ferris-wheel opens its hungry eyes and reveals a dark side to the carnival.
