Roswell

 The 50th Anniversary celebration of the well-documented UFO crash and government cover-up is the setting of this entertaining documentary about America's collective reaction to our planet's encounter with extraterrestrial beings. Without pandering to the fear-based "freak show" style highlighted by the tabloid media, this program turns to the serious aspects -- the evidence, personal testimonies, latest visual proofs and expert analysis on this ever- evolving worldwide phenomenon. With new revelations from ex-military personnel, researchers, experiencers, scientists and ordinary citizens we learn firsthand of the beliefs and remarkable events shaping our reality as we approach the millennium. Although the program briefly details the history of the flying saucer crash of 1947, it quickly moves on to where we stand today in our knowledge both of that infamous event and the more recent sightings and occurrences like the Phoenix lights and video of secret aircraft smuggled out of Area 51 in Nevada. Top researchers report on leaks from military sources and credible contactees provide insights as to what we can expect in the coming years. Ex-Pentagon Colonel Philip Corso and his best-selling "Day After Roswell" are examined as is the announcement of newly-tested metal debris fragments allegedly from the Roswell crash.
