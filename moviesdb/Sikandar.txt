Sikandar

 14 - year - old Sikandar Raza has been living with his uncle and aunt in Kashmir, ever since his parents were killed by militants 10 years ago. The young boy, who dreams of a better life for his family by realizing his football talent, is a bit of a loner at school and an easy target for the school bullies. One day on his way home from a school football match, Sikandar finds a gun lying on the path. Despite being warned against it by his new friend Nasreen, Sikandar picks up the gun believing it to be the answer to his problems. When playing with the gun alone in the woods, Sikandar meets a young man who teaches him how to be a great shot, but the young man is not who he seems and Sikandar innocently becomes caught up in political warfare. Although the quiet Nasreen acts as Sikandar's conscience, Sikandar gets further embroiled in situations beyond his control, and innocent people get killed. As the story unfolds we see that Sikandar is an innocent victim in a game being played out between the militants, the army, the peace-bartering Politians and religious heads of the little Kashmiri town. After his parents are killed by Jihaadis, Sikandar Raza, goes to live with his Kupwara-based paternal uncle, Arshad, and aunt, Rukshana, a region where people live in fear from both Jihaadis and the Indian Army. He studies and plays football in the nearby school where he is often bullied by three male students. One day while returning home, he finds a gun, and decides to keep it to protect himself from school bullies. A few days later, he promises his aunt that he will get her a washing machine, and gets recruited by Zehgeer Quadir, the Jihaadi leader of Kashmir Azad Force so that he can fulfill his promise. Sikander will soon find out that the price he has to pay for the washing machine is to assassinate a peace-loving politician, Mukhtar Masoodi, from Kashmir Peace Front.
