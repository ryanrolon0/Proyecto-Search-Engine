 This subject is in three scenes, showing beautiful dissolving effects. Scene 1. Shows Admiral Schley upon the bridge of the Brooklyn commanding the American fleet in Santiago Harbor. The Spanish fleet is seen to emerge from Santiago Harbor. Simultaneously ships and forts open fire on the American fleet. Scene 2. The Man Behind the Gun. The gun crews are seen manipulating a 13-inch gun repeatedly with terror to Cervera's fleet; one of Cervera's fleet is seen to sink directly from the results of the Brooklyn's firing. A shell is seen to burst among the crew, wounding one of its members.
