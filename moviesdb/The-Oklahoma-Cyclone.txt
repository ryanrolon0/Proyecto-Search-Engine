The Oklahoma Cyclone

 Jimmy Henderson is looking for his missing father. Suspecting McKim, he joins his gang posing as the outlaw the Oklahoma Cyclone. The gang members take a dislike to him except for Slim who becomes his friend, a friend he will need when the showdown begins. In 1936, director/writer John P. McCarthy would recycle this film again in Tex Ritter's first starring western "Song of the Gringo." Here, feigning flight from the law,Jimmy Henderson ('Bob Steele (I)' (qv)), posing as outlaw Jim Smith (the Oklahoma Cyclone) maneuvers his way into the gang of ranch foreman McKim ('Charles King (II)' (qv))), aka Black Diablo, and Jim is immediately attracted to Carmelita Carlos ('Rita Rey (I)' (qv))), daughter of ranch owner Dan Pablo Carlos ('Hector Sarno' (qv)), who is unaware of the outlaw activities of his foreman and most of the ranch hands. The gang robs a bank and goes across the border, where McKim is keeping prisoner Sheriff Henderson ('Fred Burns (I)' (qv)),Jim's father and the discovery of whose whereabouts was Jim's reason for joining the gang.
