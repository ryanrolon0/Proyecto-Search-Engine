Shakha Proshakha

 An aged patriarch (Ajit Bannerjee), popular for his scrupulous honesty, has a heart attack in the middle of a town gathering in his honour. The event brings togehter his four sons, of which the second Proshanto (Soumitra) has been in reclusive insanity for several years after a shock incident years ago. Waiting for closure on the father's health situation, the four reminisce and relive ideological differences.
