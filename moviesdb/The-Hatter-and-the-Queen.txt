The Hatter and the Queen

 Alice has grown older and as a result her imagination has been all but abandoned. The effects on Wonderland, her dream world, have been dire. The Queen of hearts is missing and the Mad Hatter has seized control over her kingdom. After a horrible nightmare in which Alice witnesses the Hatter butcher his old friend the March Hare, she plummets down the rabbit hole once again to a place in which the line between dreams and reality begin to blur. The Hatter and The Queen is loosely based on the novels, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking- Glass by Lewis Carroll.
