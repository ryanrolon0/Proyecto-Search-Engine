The Nose Collectors

 Meet Johnny Dublab and Maxwell Bibbs, two psychologically-addled serial killers with the shared hobby of collecting other people's noses. While Maxwell kills for the pure pleasure of violence, Johnny creates stop-motion animated shorts with these severed noses. When they embark on creating a feature film, disaster ensues.
