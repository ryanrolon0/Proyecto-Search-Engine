The Mechanik

 Spetnaz (Special Ops) veteran Nick Cherenko leaves Russia after his son and wife are killed in a gunfight by drug lord Aleksandr 'Sasha' Popov's mob men. He's threatened with exposure as illegal car mechanic in L.A. by a fellow ex-pat tycoon who offers him $500,000 to liberate her kidnapped daughter. He only takes the job when told the capturers are Sasha's goons again. The mission's long path to find the girl and escape over the Finnish border, where his team is to be paid, is littered with blood and corpses. Nick Cherenko used to be a Spetznaz (Russian Special Forces), but now he lives peaceful with his wife and child, far from violence and war. When his wife and his children die in the cross-fire of a gang war, Nick seeks vengeance, waking up the soldier inside himself in order to settle the score. Dolph Lundgren (Rocky IV, Universal Soldier) stars as Nick Cherenko, a retired Russian Special Forces hitman in this fast-paced, action packed film. When his wife and young son are killed by a group of Russian mobsters, Cherenko leaves the country and starts a new life in the U.S. as a mechanic. He leads a rather peaceful life until, one day, a elderly Russian woman appears and offers Cherenko a large sum of money to rescue her kidnapped daughter. Initially reluctant to take on the job, Cherenko changes his mind when he discovers the identity of the kidnappers - the men who killed his wife and son.
