The Women of Spring Break

 Anne is feeling trapped by her life as housewife. She convinces Denise and Claire to take off for spring break at Paradise Beach, just like they did twenty years before. Claire, who works for Euro Tropic suntan lotion, tries to avoid falling in love with Jean-Luc, the new product spokesman. Denise rekindles her old relationship with Mark, the perennial lifeguard. And Anne is approached by George, the young desk manager at the hotel.
