The Prophet of Lake Erie

 Slowhand Jack is a guitar player, with dreams of fame and greatness. But he's thrust awake by a strong earthquake, finding himself on the Lake Erie shore. He looks around, but seems to be the only one feeling the rumbling. He talks to a man named Skip, who claims to work in the salt mines beneath Lake Erie. Skip tells Jack of a wild tale of underground mining far greater than public knowledge, that is threatening to collapse Lake Erie. Though everyone else thinks Jack is crazy, he sets out to save his city from total destruction.
