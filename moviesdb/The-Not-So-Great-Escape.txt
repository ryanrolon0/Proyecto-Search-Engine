The Not-So-Great Escape

 Jennifer, a would-be escape artist, becomes the butt of her roommate Cleo's jibes when she can't escape from the easiest tricks in the mail-order lessons. Soon the tables are turned when Cleo becomes curious and tries to escape from the same ropes that bound her roomie and fails. When a thief leaves the buxom ladies tied and gagged, they race to see who can escape from their bondage first.
