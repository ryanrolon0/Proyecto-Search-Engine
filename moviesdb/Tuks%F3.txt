 All her life, Mayette believed that sex should only happen within marriage. However, try as she might, she never succeeded in pushing it out of her mind. Especially since when she looks around, everyone seems to be doing 'it' - her friends, her colleagues, and even her juvenile students. Everyone, except her. When a recent spate of teenage pregnancies alarms the principal of the public high school where Mayette teaches biology, she is tasked to incorporate sex education into her lesson. The problem is, at 32, Mayette is still a virgin. How on earth can she teach her students about sex when she herself has never been with a man?
