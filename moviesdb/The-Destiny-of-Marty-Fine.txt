The Destiny of Marty Fine

 Marty has plans inner-city kids from LA. He's also got a problem murder, so a local boss wants to ensure that Marty doesn't talk. The boss's plan is Marty's destiny. But Marty, like the boxer he used to be, wants to fight back against fate. He goes to Lena, his girlfriend, but she's had it with his unreliability; his sister, a dancer at a strip club, is done lending him money. He still talks a great game, but his Utah plans may be the pipe dream of a punch-drunk guy on his way out. He seeks out Lena for a last shot. Is there any way the sweet but simple Marty can avoid his destiny?
