The Winter of Her

 Twenty years ago, Alicia Hunter's father took his own life. She was seven years old. Now grown to adulthood, Alicia still lives in the same decaying home, in the same sleepy mountain town. Bearing years of bitter family conflicts from the past, Alicia has struggled with the memory of her father's deterioration. Now, in the dead of winter, she is lost in a blur of the past and present, pushing herself to the verge of insanity or needed change.
