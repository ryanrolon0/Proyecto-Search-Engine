Venere creola

 Two villages are situated on a little island in the Caribbean Sea and Cienfuegos. Every year there is a challenge between the two villages, a challenge between the best fighting-cocks the two villages can get. This year Cienfuegos's cock is the favourite. It is Melchiorre's cock. So the personage of Santana make a spell and a dog kills Melchiorre's cock. Melchiorre, after running the risk of being lynched, must leave in search of a new cock to win the challenge.
