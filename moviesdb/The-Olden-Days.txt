The Olden Days

 The Australian goldfields period drama _"Rush" (1974)_ (qv) was given The Late Show treatment with a slick re-editing and re-voicing which produced absurd plotlines, strange characters and 'Stupid Hat Day' on the goldfields. 'The Olden Days' originally appeared as 20 three-minute stand-alone short segments in _"Late Show, The" (1992)_ (qv), and were later strung together and released on video.
