The Stories

 As in a Sufi tale, The Stories conjures a profound situation and then undercuts it with an understand efficiency that jolts us into a moment of altered awareness. Urgently desiring an intimate connection with his dying parent, the son begs his father to talk, and in his desire to have an intimate moment with him, persists and enters into an exchange that results in an ironic encounter with reality.
