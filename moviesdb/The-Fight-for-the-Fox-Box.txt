The Fight for the Fox Box

 In this special, a myterious evildoer is fed up with the bad guys losing to the good guys all the time. He steals the broadcast codes of the Fox Box and breaks it before giving each piece to the likes of "Kirby at Ya's" King Dedede, DMP member Dialbolic from "Ultimate Muscle," "Cubix's" Dr. K, Dr. Eggman from "Sonic X," and The Shredder from "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." The Funky Cops overhear this plot and set out to stop them. The Turtle see a preview of "The Shaman King" before setting out to find parts of the code. They are joined by Cubix, Kid Muscle, Kirby, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Can the good guys along with 1,000,000 viewers watching this special stop the bad guys and save their Saturday Morning block? Or will the villains be victorious for once? Well, how much do you want to bet on any side?
