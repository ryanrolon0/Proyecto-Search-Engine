The film is an in depth discussion about expectations, relationships and risk taking between she and her life long friend Tom as they hide together between the trees. Tom, the guy next door, the guy who's secretly been in love with Knell his whole life, and who has a secret agenda for organizing this specific game. There are some flowers, some lens flare, some kissing, a little crying, and a secret scheme in the works.
