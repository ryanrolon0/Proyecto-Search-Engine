Red Dead Revolver

 In the savage, rough and tumble days of the American West, a hard working, homestead family is attacked by desperados, robbed of their possessions, and left for dead. One lone survivor, a boy named Red, is taken in by an Indian man, given a home and taught the ways of survival. Years later, a mysterious gunfighter appears in town and the lawless begin to fear for their lives. The old West will never be the same as Red fights with honor, seeking vengeance on the savage outlaws of the frontier.
