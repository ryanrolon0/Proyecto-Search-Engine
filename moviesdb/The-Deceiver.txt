The Deceiver

 Actor Reginald Thorpe is found dead in his dressing room, stabbed in the back. Suspects abound. John Wayne's only contribution was as a stand-in for the corpse. Broadway matinee idol, Shakespearean actor Reginald Thorpe, is found dead in his dressing room on the eve of his departure for Hollywood. Thorpe's understudy, Tony Hill, is suspected, particularly in light of his skill with knives. Thorpe, however, was a lady's man who seems to have been involved in blackmailing one of his lovers.
