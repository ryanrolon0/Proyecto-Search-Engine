Robbers' Roost

 Jim "Tex" Wall ('George Montgomery (I)' (qv)), searching for the last of the three men who raped and killed his wife, joins a gang of cattle rustlers led by Hank Hays ('Richard Boone (I)' (qv)). Both Hays' outlaws and a rival gang headed by Heesman ('Peter Graves (I)' (qv)), have been hired as ranch hands by "Bull" Herrick ('Bruce Bennett (I)' (qv)), a cripple who owns a large cattle ranch and wants to get his large herd to market. He theorizes that the two gangs will be kept busy watching each other and neither will rustle his cattle. Helen ('Sylvia Findley' (qv)) has little faith in her brother's contrived plan, and hates and distrusts both groups. She begins to soften toward Jim, but abruptly changes when she sees a reward poster which says he has killed two men. A rancher having 6000 head of cattle to get to market hires two gangs that hate each other. He figures each gang will not let the other rustle the cattle. Tex arrives looking for the man that killed his wife and took his horses. Finding his horses he joins the gang that are now riding them. Caught in the battle between the gangs when one double-crosses the other, he now finds the man he is looking for.
