The Tale of the Bunny Picnic

 Bean Bunny is too small to be useful (says his brother) to help prepare for the Bunny Picnic, so he wanders off and sees a legendary persecutor of all rabbits them he's seen the dog, until the dog breaks up the picnic. And it's up to Bean to come up with a plan to defeat the farmer's dog and discover the one thing the dog fears.
