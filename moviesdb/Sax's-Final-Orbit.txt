Sax's Final Orbit

 "Sax's Final Orbit" is an artistic portrayal of an unusual love story between two very different artists, a young woman, Max, who's a classical painter and Sax, a Flatlander, a sport that derives its name from intricate acrobatic movements performed on BMX bikes on flat terrain. Sax, who wants to elevate his street performance to an art form, must ultimately choose between his art and his life to achieve greatness. Flatlanding (or BMX Freestyling) is an X-Game sport where the cyclist manipulates a customized BMX bike into an acrobatic and ballet-like routine on flat terrain.
