Sights and Sounds of the Mysterious Side of Myself

 British born documentary filmmaker who was raised in the United States, travels to Belarus to connect with his Polish roots. "As you have probably noticed... my name is not English. It is Polish. And it has forever connected me to this nation. But as I've grown older my name has come to symbolize a side of me that I struggle to understand... So I'm search this nation that is so intimately connected to me, but is so mysterious as well."
