Vulcano

 While awaiting Production Code seal approval in the USA this Italian-made production went through three American distributors in three years; first Motion Picture Sales Corporation that passed it off to Eagle Lion and finally to United Artits when they acquired Eagle Lion properties. Anna Magnani, a prostitute, is banished from Naples and returns to her home, a volcanic island off of southern Italy. There, she is accepted only by her younger sister and younger brother, and takes whatever job she can to get by. Rossano Brazzi, a diver by trade but a procuer for a prostitution ring---the white slave trade in those days---sets his cap for Anna's beautiful sister who has fallen in love with him. Anna sleeps with Brazzi to convince the sister he is bad news but the sister thinks otherwise. Later, on Brazzi's boat, Anna is pumping air to him while he is on an underwater dive and she resorts to the only course she has left to save her sister. She stops pumping. Feeling guilt and remorse she then climbs the island volcano as it begins erupting.
