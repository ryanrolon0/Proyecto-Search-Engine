The Shepherd's Children

 Alison, a loving mother and caring wife details her life about her and her family's afflictions with heroin addiction and the destruction it causes. A series of events involving pleas from her Mother to go clean, an altercation between her husband Ian and their dealer 'The Shepherd', the alienation of her son Ben from the family, eventual overdoses and a life of petty theft provide the catalysts for her to go 'cold turkey'. Will Alison clean up for the sake of her own life and family or will it be destroyed through the eye of a needle?
