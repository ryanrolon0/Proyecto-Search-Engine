The Songs They Sang

 The untold true story of the amazing musical and artistic performances that took place at the Vilna Ghetto, Lithuania, during WW11, in the midst of the very darkest of persecutions. These performances brought hope and life to those in the Ghetto during the horrific attempted genocide of the Jewish people. As part of this feature length documentary, these songs and the music are reprised and performed once again by professional musicians, survivors, family members of composers who wrote works, and even a Cantor in New York.
