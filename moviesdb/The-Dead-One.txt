The Dead One

 Trapped in a purgatory between this world and the next, 21-year-old Diego wanders the streets of L.A. in search of a human sacrifice for the vicious Aztec gods that control his soul. But the sacrifice they want is Maria, his own girlfriend. The Dead One is the story of Diego's fight against the dark gods for his soul...and for the soul of the woman he loves. Diego de la Muerte is a 21-year-old Latino-American living in East L.A. where the Día de los Muertos, Day of the Dead, celebration is right around the corner. Diego dresses up as a zombie mariachi before going to a party, in the process tattooing an Aztech death symbol onto himself. On the way to the party, his car crashes and he is killed. He is sent to Mictlan, the Land of the Dead, where he is sacrificed to Mictlantecuhtli, the God of Death, who rips Diego's heart out and seals it in a clay pot, giving him total control over his soul. Diego is then returned to Earth, imprisoned inside of a his dead body, his make-up permanently etched onto his face. Now, endowed with the dark power to restore life or to take it, he must battle against the dark god Mictlantecuhtli for his soul, and for the souls of those he loves.
