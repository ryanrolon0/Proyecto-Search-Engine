 What is the best way to commemorate those who have lost their lives in war? In 1999, a group of individuals from Massachusetts decided to create a granite memorial commemorating the civilian casualties of war and pull it to the Arlington National Cemetery outside of Washington D.C. The memorial wasn't overtly political. It was dedicated to all civilians killed in war, regardless of who they were or what war they died in. It took two months for thirty or forty people to pull the two-thousand pound memorial five hundred miles. The film documents the trials that the team endured on the journey, the people that they met on route and the response they received when they reached Washington itself. The film emphasizes that civilian noncombatants suffer the greatest losses in contemporary wars and illustrates the power of the individual to contribute to social change.
