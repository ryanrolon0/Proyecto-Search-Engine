Taliya.Date.Com

 The story of Taliya's quest for finding love in the estranged world of Internet dating, based on a mouse, a keyboard and Photoshop tricks. In this comic-tragic voyage with the guidance of her flat-mate (extravagantly & cynically gay), she wanders from hope to humiliation.She drinks 45 cups of coffee (mostly soy latte) and gets involved with a few men & Husky puppy. This movie portrays the aspects that are well known to every single who plays the romantic internet game in order to snatch the ultimate prize True Love. The movie contains a feminist message and uses an unusual combination of methods such as documentation, poetry and acting; as may be expected of a film that describes the modern, yet chaotic, world of Internet dating.
