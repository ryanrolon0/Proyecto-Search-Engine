Sien lui yau wan III

 Basically a retread of the first movie, in which the evil Tree Spirit is back with yet another ghost played by Joey Wong. The Swordsman Yen and Leslie Cheung characters are replaced by a Buddhist Abbot and disciple (Tony Leung). Jacky Cheung also pops up again, this time as a money-grabbing swordsman with a neat bag of tricks.
