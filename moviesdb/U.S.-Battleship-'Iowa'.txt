U.S. Battleship 'Iowa'

 "Shows the U.S. Battle Ship 'Iowa' at anchor at the rendezvous near the Dry Tortugas. The camera was placed on a small yacht, which approaches and passes the battle ship, thus giving a complete view of one side of this mammoth war machine. The picture was taken on the sailors' wash day, and on the line stretches along the fore part of the vessel is hung their apparel. The picture is exceedingly sharp and the cannon are plainly shown as they project from the different turrets and portholes. The American flag is flying from the mast and waves in the breeze. Some distance from the stern of the vessel are two targets, and a number of sailors are seen rowing in small boats. This is a most excellent picture of the vessel and is exceptionally good from a photgraphic standpoint."
