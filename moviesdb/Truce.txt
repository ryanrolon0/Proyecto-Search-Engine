Truce

 When teenage Morgan gets on her mother's last nerve, Mom trots them off to therapy. From the Freudian to the 'Fraidy Cat, the shrinks are a strange bunch, offering no more wisdom than your garden-variety self-help book. The last one they see together, Dr. Feely, at least gets them to agree on one thing uneasy truce, leading to a tender, if short-lived, reconciliation.
