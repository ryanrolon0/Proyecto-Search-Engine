The Mountain Within

 What happens when a multi-ability team of climbers decides to take on one of the world's most feared and revered mountains, Kilimanjaro? Strong friendships evolve quickly, the bonds deepening with every step. Seemingly insurmountable obstacles defeat some but leave others yet more determined to continue. Powerful emotions are unleashed as tensions run high, but laughter is never far behind the tears. The many stories that unfold provide a powerful insight into the climbers' emotional and physical journeys as they struggle with the challenge of a lifetime. Emmy award winning cinematographer, Gordon Brown, directed by Kyle Portbury and supported by Gregory Rinaldi (producer) and Kate Coggins (editor), climb as part of the team, creating a feel that is up close and personal as well as epic. Renowned composer, Michael Price, draws inspiration for the score from the developing narrative and extraordinary backdrop. And by the time the summit comes into view, it is clear that there is nothing to differentiate the climbers with disabilities from the other team members. This amazing journey of the spirit shows us that it is often our hearts and minds rather than our bodies that limit all of us. The Mountain Within is a testament to the incredible generosity of numerous organizations and individuals who donated their funds, resources and time. It is also a testament to Enham, the UK charity that organised the climb, who give those with disabilities opportunities to make real choices in life.
