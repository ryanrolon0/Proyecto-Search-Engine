Rainbow Riders

 Jerry Hixon's ranch is being besieged by raiders so Ben sends for his friend Bud. When Bud arrives and finds that the outlaw Texarkana Pete has been captured, he buys Pete's clothes and posing as Pete joins the outlaw gang. But he is quickly in trouble when his masquerade is exposed. Haley Davis wants the ranch owned by Jerry Hickson, and has hired gunmen to shoot at and run off her cowhands, so Jerry has turned the ranch into a Sanitarium caring for invalid and ailing patients. Foreman Ben Brown sends for his friend Bud Regan to come help. In town Bud sees that wanted outlaw Texarkana Pete, aka as The Candy Kid has been captured by a deputy, and learns that Davis has sent for Pete to join his gang. Since Davis has never seen Pete, Bud takes his clothes and letter and joins the Davis gang posing as Pete.
