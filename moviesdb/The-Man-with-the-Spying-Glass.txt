The Man with the Spying Glass

 Placit lives in a dreamless society where people have to take pills to stop dreaming and thinking. Almost everyone wears helmets, which gives global government access to human thoughts. Placit's deepest dream is to be a puppeteer. However, he is afraid to go against the system which was created by his father, and strongly defended by Placit's cynical self.
