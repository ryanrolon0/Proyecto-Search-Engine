Take Me Home Tonight

 It's the late 1980s, when Wall Street is riding high, and it seems as if the entire country is cashing in on the bumper profits. Disgusted with the materialism that surrounds him, Matt Franklin, a brilliant young MIT graduate, has walked out on his well-paid position at a local lab and taken a low-level job as a video clerk, much to his father Bill's consternation. And the crises keep piling up in Matt's life. His best buddy Barry has just gotten fired from his job, his brainy sister Wendy is getting hitched to her vapid boyfriend Kyle, and the gorgeous Tori Frederking, long-time object of Matt's unattainable adoration, is suddenly back in the picture. Now, on one wild, woolly and irresponsible evening, everything is coming to a head, with explosive results. Summer is winding down in the San Fernando Valley, and so are the '80s. But on one final night during Labor Day weekend 1988, five friends' lives will intersect at an all-night party as they declare-for the last time before turning a corner into adulthood. MIT alum Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) was poised to make the most of the Me Decade. He should be in a corner office, starting his upward climb to full-fledged yuppie-hood. Instead, the directionless 22-year-old has taken a part-time job behind the counter of a Suncoast video at the local mall. But when Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer)-the most popular girl from Matt's high school-walks into the store, he decides to take one last swing at greatness. With his twin sister, Wendy (Anna Faris), and their best friend, Barry (Dan Fogler), he rolls out for an epic end-of-summer party. We follow the trio as they say goodbye to the teenage friends and personalities that defined them. As the night wears on, Matt fakes an identity to impress Tori... Wendy faces a proposal from her high school sweetheart, Kyle (Chris Pratt) ... and Barry, having just been fired from his dream job of selling luxury cars, takes a walk on the wild side.
