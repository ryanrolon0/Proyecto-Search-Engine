 THE REPAIRMAN is a hilarious black comedy in which a government agent (disguised as a telephone repairman) is assigned to observe a blacklisted writer, but ends up ingeniously blackmailing him to write the reports about himself. Also to have an audience, at last - someone who is truly familiar with his censored books and plays - the writer agrees but soon discovers that now even the reports he writes on himself are considered to be too dark and harsh so even these are censored again
