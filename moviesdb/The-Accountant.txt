The Accountant

 Daniel Bennett gets more than he bargained for after a night in the cells leads to a meeting with a man known to most as The Accountant. Forced in to a situation with looming debts and a unsupporting wife, Daniel soon finds that he cannot stand being in a position where his working life poses a threat to actually living. After plotting an audacious plan to take a large amount of money from his dirty employer Daniel soon realises that in order to steal from these people he'll have to act like them - and run faster than them.
