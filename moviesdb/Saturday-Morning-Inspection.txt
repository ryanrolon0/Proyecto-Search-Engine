Saturday Morning Inspection

 SATURDAY MORNING INSPECTION is a short film made by two cadets currently studying at the United States Air Force Academy. Using the model of a military member making a bed, the film attempts to challenge the viewer through symbolism whether the nation has been affected by the nationally-publicized misconduct of cadets at the Air Force Academy and whether a tradition of sacrifice continues in the military today.
