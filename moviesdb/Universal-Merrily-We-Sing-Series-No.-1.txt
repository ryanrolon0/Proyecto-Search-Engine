Universal Merrily We Sing Series No. 1

 Universal decided to start a series of audience-participation (follow the bouncing ball) shorts about the time the other studios were halting production on such. The first entry starred radio-and-record star Jane Pickens thinking of her overseas dream soldier while singing "I'll Be Walking With My Honey," "I Never Knew" and "I'll See You in My Dreams." Most audiences, as usual, declined to sing along.
