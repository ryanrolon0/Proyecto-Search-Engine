The Life Ballet

 The Life Ballet is written from the perspective of a woman who made the choice of abortion. The story is told through dance, artistry and original songs how destinies were lost through abortion including two unborn children, Seraphina and Simon, and their mother. The audience sees how abortion alters the dances of our mother, whose name is Sarah, as she moves through innocence, deception, seduction, decision and death. The aftermath of abortion leaves her in a dance of a new kind, one tormented by the silence of shame. Watch as she grieves and mourns the loss of her unborn children, then watch as she discovers healing. The show is dedicated to all the children who never had the chance to dance.
