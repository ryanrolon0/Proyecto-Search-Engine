The Devil's Matchmaker

 Alexander is a matchmaker like any other most of the time, but as a side hobby he sets up dates with people whose last names make hilarious combinations, like Peters-Rising or Small-Johnson. He hopes with every such date that one day the couple will marry, providing the world with some humor and Alexander with his trophy, making him the Devil's Matchmaker.
