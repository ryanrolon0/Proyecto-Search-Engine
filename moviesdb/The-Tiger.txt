The Tiger

 Takes place on the Siberian plain, where human development is encroaching on the tigers' habitat and one tiger turns on the intruders. With townspeople being tracked and hunted with an almost supernatural power, a conservationist game warden must face down the tiger. It is a fight that only one of them can win.
