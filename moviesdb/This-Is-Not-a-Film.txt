This Is Not a Film

 New Yorker Michael Connor attempts to find the woman who left him by making a film about her, hoping that someone (maybe you?) will recognize his ex and convince her to get back together with him. To help the viewer understand who he is and why his girlfriend left, Michael opts to re-enact his failed relationship for the camera. He hires an actress to portray his ex-girlfriend, and during the process of filming she quickly and mercilessly points out all of his mistakes, blunders and inadequacies as a boyfriend. "This Is Not a Film" is a romantic comedy about making mistakes and recognizing them in the most painful way possible--by making them over and over again.
