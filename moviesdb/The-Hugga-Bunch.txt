The Hugga Bunch

 A young girl named Bridget Severson lives with her parents, brother, and grandmother. Her aunt Ruth comes by regularly too. Everyone but her grandmother, is too busy for hugging or showing affection. She soon finds out that they've talked her grandmother into going to a nursing home. Bridget, being so upset by this, follows a little creature named Huggins through her closet mirror to HuggaLand in search of a way to make her grandmother young again. In HuggaLand, she learns that eating the fruit of the young berry tree can give instant youth. Unfortunately, the only young berry tree grows in the Country/Land of Shrugs. She'll have to cross the sea of broken glass, pass the hairy behemoth, and venture into the evil Queen Admira's castle. Will Bridget succeed?
