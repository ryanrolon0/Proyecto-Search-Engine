Up North

 Our environment and culture have been linked to our evolution since the dawn of civilization. In the summer of 2007, three adventurers set out on a journey across the north into the Arctic Circle, in exploration of the impact change has on the landscape and people's lives. Through conversations with First Nations Chiefs, Elders, comedians, artists, dancers and mountaineers, Up North takes you on a journey of discovery and inquiry. Set against the stunning beauty of North America's last wilderness, it accesses an alternate history of Canada's north, told through the wisdom of experience and the reflection of our culture in the landscape.
