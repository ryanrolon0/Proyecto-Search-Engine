Riders in the Sky

 When asked about the Ghost Riders song he sings, Gene Autry ('Gene Autry (I)' (qv)) tells this legend investigator for the county attorney and go into the cattle business with his pal Chuckawalla Jones ('Pat Buttram (I)' (qv)) but decides instead to help Anne Lawson ('Gloria Henry' (qv)) clear her father, rancher Ralph Lawson (Steve Darrell' (qv)), of a false murder charge. He looks for the three witnesses who can testify that Lawson shot only in self defense in killing a gambler, but the witnesses are terrorized by another gambler, town boss Rock McCleary ('Robert Livingston (I)' (qv)), who shoots witness Pop Roberts ('Tom London' (qv))Morgan. Fatally wounded, Pop gives Gene the information needed to clear Lawson, then dies crying the "Ghost Riders" are coming for him. Gene then heads for a showdown with McCleary. In a town virtually owned by Rock McCleary, Ralph Lawson is in jail, framed for murder. Autry arrives to save his friend and win his friend's daughter Ann. Ralph Lawson kills a man in self defense but Old Man Roberts, the only witness not working for McCleary, will not testify to that having been scared by McLeary. When McCleary's men injure Roberts in a wagon accident, he confesses to Gene before he dies. Gene then buys a ranch from McCleary. When McCleary learns the water rights he thought were still his and that he needs for his big deal went with the ranch, he and has men head out to kill Gene.
