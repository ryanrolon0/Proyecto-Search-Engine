 Joy and Richard are falling in love. Only Joy is hiding the fact that she is a call girl and Richard is hiding the fact that he is married to someone else. Jake and Maggie have just had a down-syndrome baby, and Jake, a recovering crystal meth addict, is beginning to escape reality one last time. Diane, a black woman who wants to be white, is in love with Kevin, a white man who, bored with his life and rebelling against his wealthy and manipulative parents, wants to try something new. The consequences of this interracial relationship could be disinheritance for him. And to tie it all together, an auditor, Daniel, is coming to town to layoff an entire building full of accountants, including Maggie, Richard, Diane, and Kevin, because the firm squandered too much money on an unrelated and risky investment scheme and must drastically cut their overhead.
