Two-Minute Heist

 Slacker Dino Rado, and his uptight partner, Steven Scheere made a bad investment. They borrowed money to fund a "B" movie that flopped big time and now the Jamaican Mob wants it's money back. As a last resort they steal and idea from a screenplay to cast unsuspecting actors to pull off a real heist. Their plan is flawless, until they put it into action. Dino and Steven didn't plan on getting shot at, beat up, and even worse, falling in love.
