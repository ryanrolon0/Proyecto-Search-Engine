Punch-Drunk Love

 Barry Egan is a small business owner with seven sisters whose abuse has kept him alone and unable to fall in love. When a harmonium and a mysterious woman enter his life, his romantic journey begins. Barry Egan runs his own company, is continually hounded by his seven sisters, and every now and then gets a tiny bit violent. One odd morning a harmonium first appears in the street then a striking young lady asks for his help with her car. She re-appears a few days later and there seems to be a spark between them, but can they possibly cut through his seemingly over-complicated life and his somewhat unusual interpersonal skills? Barry Egan is a wreck, driven to breakdown by the henpecking of his seven sisters. He steals his heart and manhood away from the curbside. Slowly he learns how to direct them toward love, for the sake of and with the help of another troubled soul.
