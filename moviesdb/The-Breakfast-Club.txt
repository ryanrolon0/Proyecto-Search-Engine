The Breakfast Club

 They were five students with nothing in common, faced with spending a Saturday detention together in their high school library. At 7 a.m., they had nothing to say, but by 4 p.m., they had bared their souls to each other and become good friends. To the outside world they were simply the Jock, the Brain, the Criminal, the Princess and the Kook, but to each other, they would always be the Breakfast Club. When five high school students, Andrew, John, Allison, Brian, and Claire, meet in detention one day. The principal wants them to write an essay, and they think they are in for a boring 8 hours of doing nothing. At first, they argue and hate each other, but after smoking some marijuana, they pour their hearts out to each other, and tell about their fears, secrets, and their deepest emotions, and problems.
