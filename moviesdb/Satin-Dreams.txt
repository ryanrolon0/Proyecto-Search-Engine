Satin Dreams

 Life isn't working out for Ryan Duncan. Jobless, loveless, and homeless, he's offered a place to stay by his friend Kim, who is shocked to learn about his unusual past. She gently pushes him into a solution to all his troubles - a solution that involves skirts and make-up! Suddenly, Ryan (as Rachel) finds himself getting everything he's longed for, including a job and an intimate relationship with Kim. But there's trouble on the horizon, in the form of Kim's old flame. And then things really heat up. Can "Rachel" truly find happiness?
