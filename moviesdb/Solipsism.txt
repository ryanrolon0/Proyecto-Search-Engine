Solipsism

 Musically and visually stunning, ugly mus-tard never put on the same show twice. You just never knew what to expect but a fantastic and unique experience every single time. Loaded with live performances, this movie captures the different faces of ugly mus-tard on and off stage. On the verge of being signed with a major record label and their third album in the works, the band called it quits. This documentary is the only official movie ever made.
