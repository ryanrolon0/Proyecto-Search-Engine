The Loser

 Log line the exploits of a gentleman just trying to get to his favorite singer's concert one evening. Everything that you could possibly imagine going wrong for our gentlemen loser, does go wrong for him. Shot in the style of a silent film but taking place in contemporary times, 'The Loser' shows us all, what it is like to have a really bad day.
