Thembi's Diary

 Thembi's Diary is an animation created from an original audio documentary from NPR Radio Diaries. Thembi was 17 when Radio Diaries producer Joe Richman gave her a tape recorder to document her life. Living in a South African township with aids, Thembi had all the reasons to give up and hate the world. However she woke up every morning and talked to her aids with a strong determined voice. 'As long as you don't hurt me I won't hurt you'
