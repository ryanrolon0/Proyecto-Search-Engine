Romeo & Julia und die neue Weltordnung

 Accompanied by his loving family, the American President is on a state visit in Berlin, Old Europe. While he is meeting the German Chancellor, the president's bored daughter Julia escapes from her security guards and strolls through Berlin. Driven by fate, she runs into the rose-seller Romeo and falls in love with the guy, who turns out to be a son of Osama bin Laden. The two young lovers decide to stick to their love and, despite the hatred between their families. But while Romeo and Juliet plan their soon marriage, the public misinterprets the sudden disappearance of the President's daughter. Particularly the US-channel "WAR News" with embedded journalist Tybalt Tybaltovic finds out scandalous news about the hijacking of poor Juliet. Experts say that Al Quaida is eligible. And the America President threatens Germany with serious consequences, if the former ally continues supporting terrorism. And we all know what that means in these tough times!
