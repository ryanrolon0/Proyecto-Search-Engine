Tales from the Hood

 Four short, moralistic horror vignettes (a la EC Comics) that deal with mostly black characters. The framing story introduces three youths out to pick up a drug shipment at a funeral parlor from the strange director, Mr. Simms. As the three punks wind their way through the parlor, Mr. Simms tells them the last stories of some of his more interesting clients. When three drug dealers ('Samuel Monroe Jr.' (qv), 'Joe Torry' (qv), and 'De'aundre Bonds' (qv)) are called to a funeral parlor to collect a stash of drugs, they are greeted by the creepy, eccentric Mr. Simms ('Clarence Williams III' (qv)), who proceeds to tell them four moralistic tales of terror regarding the deceased who lie in his parlor. The first tale concerns a man murdered by crooked police officers ('Tom Wright (I)' (qv)) and the officer who begins hearing his voice from beyond the grave ('Anthony Griffith' (qv)) to avenge his death. The second story deals with a boy named Walter ('Brandon Hammond (I)' (qv)), the monster who torments him ('David Alan Grier' (qv)), and the teacher who realizes that something is wrong ('Rusty Cundieff' (qv)). The third story deals with a white supremacist running for governor ('Corbin Bernsen' (qv)) who lives in an old house with a history of racial violence and who refuses to heed the warnings of the supernatural presence that occupies it. Finally, the fourth story deals with a career criminal ('Lamont Bentley' (qv)) who agrees to undergo a horrific behavioral modification program overseen by a government-employed scientist ('Rosalind Cash' (qv)). The stories each become gradually scarier as Mr. Simms go on and as the drug dealers begin to lose their patience, until they are ultimately given what they have come for - and find that there is something much more evil to the funeral home than they ever realized.
