Project Reject

 Chilly Willy's life was very quiet and peaceful, until a military installation appeared next to his igloo. Smedley is constantly sent out by his superior, Admiral Attlepate, to investigate unidentified flying objects, and the flames from his jet plane's exhaust keep melting Chilly's igloo. A frustrated Chilly decides to take action, with an anchor and an RC airplane as his weapons. Will Chilly drive the intruders out?
