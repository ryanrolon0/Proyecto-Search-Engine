Steven Spielberg's Movie

 A young film director named Milo Jacobson is awaiting word from his girlfriend's uncle (a sleazy movie producer named Donald Columbus) as to whether or not he will finance Milo's screenplay to make a film. What Milo doesn't realize is that Don hates his script. When Don informs Milo that the only way he'd finance his film is if Milo were to tell him that Steven Spielberg is directing it, Milo does the only thing he can do; he legally changes his name to Steven Spielberg. Don takes a liking to this "angle". Milo just wants to get his film made, while Don Columbus wants to use Milo's new name to dupe the public and make a profit. This is where the absurdity begins!
