Roger & Sheryl

 In 1998 Roger married Sheryl, who was ten years his senior and just a few months removed from an abusive marriage, without ever having seen her. This is because Roger has Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a condition that has left him blind for seventeen years. Every time he blinks, his eyelashes scratch his dry cornea. This creates deep grooves that have almost obliterated his vision. His left eye was removed at the age of 12 and the cornea of his right eye is so damaged many doctors have declared it "beyond recovery". However, thanks to a radical new treatment, Roger will lay eyes on his wife for the first time and the implications of him regaining his vision are quite complex. Roger is outspoken and emotional about his desire to provide for his wife and children, and do "what a man's supposed to do". Outwardly Sheryl is supportive and excited, but privately she is anxiously bracing for what Roger seeing her for the first time could mean.
