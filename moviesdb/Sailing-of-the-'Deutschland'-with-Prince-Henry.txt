Sailing of the 'Deutschland' with Prince Henry

 Here our camera was stationed on the roof of the pier shed of the Hamburg American Line at Hoboken, N. J., and shows the Deutschland, the finest Ocean Greyhound afloat, backing away from her pier, carrying the Royal visitor, Prince Henry. As the steamer leaves the wharf a great crowd of people congregates on the promenade deck and bow of the steamer, and they are seen to be waving farewell to the great crowd on the wharf assembled to bid Prince Henry a God-speed. As the steamer backs out into the stream, she presents a most perfect and stirring marine view, with dense clouds of smoke pouring from her four funnels. Numerous tugs are also seen puffing and pulling at the hausers in their endeavor to place the big steamer in position to begin her run to Europe.
