The Photo

 The Photo is the story of Tarun, 11, and Sheena, 9, who live in a small Indian village. Sheena's hobby is to collect wedding pictures from popular magazines. One day, Tarun suggests that the two of them go to a local studio to take a "wedding" picture. Shy and scared, Sheena resists, but is finally persuaded by Tarun's arguments. Ignorant of the cost of taking a photo, the children arrive at a studio with just a few coins. The events take an unexpected turn, which changes their lives forever.
