Trash Town

 Fresh out of prison Tiger Swallowtail and the Man rumble their way through the shadows of a nasty little town to find Tiger's children. The biker's offspring have run away from their less-than-Christian ministers and have become entangled in a knot of drugs and violence. Strong characters and improvisational acting plunge us into a non-stop action short located in a place that can only be called Trash Town.
