The Electric Valley

 This documentary tells the story of the Tennessee Valley Authority through the use of archival footage and modern interviews. Created by FDR's New Deal, the TVA brought cheap electricity and modernization to the 7-state Tennessee River Valley, but it also brought unwanted competition to local power providers, as well as controversial dams, nuclear plants, pollution, strip mining, and federal bureaucracy to a region suspicious of government meddling.
