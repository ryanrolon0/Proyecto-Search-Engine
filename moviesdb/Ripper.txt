Ripper

 You play reporter Jake Quinlan in this modern interpretation of the Ripper legend. Three acts and the possibility of four different endings lead up to an explosive climax in cyber space. Jack's back. In 2040, a vicious serial killer stalks the mean streets of New York, eviscerating his victims and vanishing without a trace, leaving no clues to his, or her, identity. Only you, as crime reporter Jake Quinlan, can crack the case. There are three suspects; Detective Magnota, lead investigator of the case; Dr. Burton, the doctor with the mysterious past; Falconetti, master hacker; and your own girlfriend and fellow reporter Catherine, whose mother may have been the Ripper's first victim. It's up to you, uncover the clues and catch the killer, or else you may be next.
