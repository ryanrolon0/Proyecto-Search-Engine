Throughout the weekend, Charles will contend with his place in this small town, his fear of leaving it, and the girl that got away because of his responsible nature. Annie will confront the very reasons she left this small town, her fear of coming back to it, and the men upon whom she has relied to avoid responsibility for her own life. As both Charles and Annie begin to see how the traits of the other would have better served them in making major life choices, they develop a mutual respect, and realize that it is never too late to make things right or to turn your life around.
