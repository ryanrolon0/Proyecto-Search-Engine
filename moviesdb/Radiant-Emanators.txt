Radiant Emanators

 A holy scripture appears floating in outer space. It is covered with text, copiously illustrated, and refers to a wide range of fanciful incidents, including Walt Whitman's trip down the Long Island Expressway, the trials of a pregnant teenager, and ballerinas who stuff their toe shoes with newspaper, among many other things. An illuminated manuscript, based on a fully improvised performance, Radiant Emanators mediates on the effect of uneven sources of light on written texts, and on the way our uneven readings of our own cultural texts determine our views on genocide, sexual freedom, and our general consciousness.
