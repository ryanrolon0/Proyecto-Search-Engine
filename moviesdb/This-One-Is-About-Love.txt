This One Is About Love

 A writer meets his muse and falls in love with her in a wartime shelter. Amidst gunfire, bombs, and with desperation mounting, the writer tells a love story to a group of frightened children. In his magical tale a heart-broken King grieves his Queen. Ultimately, the surreal world of the Kingdom and the dark reality of war become one and the same, making the children realize that, in the end, all is simply about love!
