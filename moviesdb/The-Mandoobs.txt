The Mandoobs

 Two best friends, Ahmed and Mohammed have just recently been fired from their jobs as "Mandoobs". They decide to ask for their jobs back in an attempt to get revenge on their former boss by ruining his business. While the two are going about their plan, one of them gets promoted and ends up in a tough situation, whether to help his life-long best friend or to follow his dream of having a successful career and betray him.
