The Mystic Wreath

 The conjurer appears and hangs up an extraordinary wreath made of evergreens. The wreath is apparently suspended in the air with nothing whatever visible to hold it up. The conjurer then waves his baton and causes many images to appear in the wreath including a picture of Mephisto, followed by the bust of a beautiful young lady, and then the conjurer's own image, talking, smiling and bowing. The changes are made by one figure fading away and then being replaced by another. This is a most mystifying picture and entirely amusing.
