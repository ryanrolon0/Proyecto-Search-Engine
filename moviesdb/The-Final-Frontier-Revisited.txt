The Final Frontier Revisited

 The Crew of the USS St. Paul has encountered a subspace wormhole and finds itself transported back to 1873 Hastings, Minnesota. Join co-Captain's Paul Elsworth and Jim Saxford as they battle the life and times of the pioneer Midwest. The evil town Marhsall Zacarius Hudson wants nothing to do with "these men from the moon." It is the classic battle of good verses evil as the brave Federation crew, led by the stoic large Vulcan Mr. Sakk and the heroic Irishman Engineer Agnus O'Malley adapt to the crude technology of the 19th century. To complicate matters, it turns out that Marshall Hudson is also Captain Elsworth's great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather. Did we mention the Klingons have just landed in Iowa! Full speed ahead Mr. O'Malley!
