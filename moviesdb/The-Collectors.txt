The Collectors

 Fifty percent of us collect something. In this film we meet some of the UK's most eccentric collectors. From collecting adjustable spanners to Commodore cassettes; from Bakelite to china dogs and from valuable old Irish photographs to bric-a-brac, which takes over the house, it seems there are a countless number of ways to collect. Do we do it for nostalgic reasons and the longing for holding on to yesterday, or is it for some kind of recognition of status within a sub-culture. This documentary throws us into the world of collecting where we seek the answers to these questions. We look into how collecting began and how it has changed over time and ask the all important question - 'why do we collect?'
