Toshka i Toshko

 "Toshka and Toshko" is an incredible story filmed in the style of black and white silent movies. Two wretches, pickpockets, who after their extraordinary meeting get involved into burglary, robbery, beating, police chase and finally... a kiss. The pickpockets are not the only once responsible for the Different happy end. A rotten apple and a piece of an old film also play a major role in the story.
