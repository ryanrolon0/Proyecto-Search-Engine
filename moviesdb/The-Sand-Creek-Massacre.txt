The Sand Creek Massacre

 A documentary film in progress, The Sand Creek Massacre, will be an hour-long examination of an open wound in the souls of the Cheyenne people as told from their perspective. On November 29, 1864, members of the United States Army savagely slaughtered 150 peace-seeking Cheyenne and Arapaho children, women and men under its protection. Simmering tensions have been activated as expansion again encroaches upon Cheyenne land and this sacred burial site. This film chronicles that horrific 19th century event and its affect on the 21st century struggle for respectful coexistence between white and Native American plains cultures.
