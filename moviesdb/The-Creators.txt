The Creators

 What happens when a nation, ravaged by government-enforced oppression, breaks loose from its shackles and takes hold of its own destiny? The Creators steps into the lives of artists sculpting South Africa's future from the fragments of a tumultuous past. Weaving through the lives of Faith47 (street art), Warongx (afro-blues), Emile (hip hop), Sweat.X (glam rap), Blaq Pearl (spoken word) and Mthetho (opera), the film culminates in an intertwined story. Born in separate areas of the formerly-segregated country, the artists separately recraft history -- and the impacts of apartheid -- in their own artistic languages. The lens explores the artists' individual eccentricities, revealing the connections among strangers' lives -- and the creative expression that can traverse the divide.
