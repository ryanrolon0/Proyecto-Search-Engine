The Volunteer

 After a masterful performance as Othello in a London theater 'Ralph Richardson' (qv) is asked for an autograph by Fred, his dresser. A short while later, Fred has joined the Fleet Air Arm (Fly Navy) and has become a hero, rescuing a pilot from his burning plane. When Fred goes to Buckingham Palace it's Ralph's turn to ask for an autograph.
