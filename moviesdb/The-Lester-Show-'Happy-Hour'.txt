The Lester Show 'Happy Hour'

 Lester, a skinny kid lives with his rat in an abandoned car underneath the freeway overpass. On this epic journey he makes friends with dead fish, chases Waldo around a Spaghetti O's can, finds guidance in the gutter and meets our country-fried president. His hallucinations, dreams and fragmented half-truths go full circle when he returns home to his Starsky & Hutch styled 71 Ford Torino.
