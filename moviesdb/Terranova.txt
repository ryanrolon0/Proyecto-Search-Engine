Terranova

 Based on the novel "La mar es mala mujer" (Raúl Guerra Garrido, 1987), "Newfoundland" tells the gauge of a man who faces his fate. Antxón Elizalde, an experienced skipper of a fishing boat, clashes a young captain, Jose Antonio Errandonea, who is also disputing the love of his partner in land, Ainara. The sea and women seem to be the same. Antxón will have to work hard to retrieve his job, his love and his status for the others and for himself. Icebergs going adrift, ice and gigantic sea waves form the landscape of this story loaded with epics and legend. Newfoundland means struggling against the sea and the elements, against accidents on board. Against love and death.
