Skinned

 In this bone chilling tale of terror we plummet into the world of Yolanda Alvarez, a twenty-one year old self-centered vixen with the beauty of a goddess who will stop at nothing to attain first place at the annual "Miss Latina Beauty Pageant". But when several of Yolanda's top rivals are found savagely murdered the competition is abruptly cancelled sending Yolanda on a rampage and the police scrambling for clues to who is butchering young attractive females. But Yolanda soon finds out that the pageant is the least of her worries. Unbeknownst to her, she has just been entered into a different type of competition. One where the judge is a psychopath using an unconventional method of murder and mutilation, and hell-bent on proving the phrase "True beauty lies within". In this vicious battle for survival the only rules to the contest are loose and you die! And the only quality she'll need to survive is something that she might not possess; A HEART!
