That's Amore!

 Danny Aiello hosts a look at the themes of the pop music of the 1950s and 60s that had an Italian flavor. His emphasis is on the ways the music was part of family life, reflecting family values. We watch Perry Como, Julius LaRosa, Connie Francis, Rosie Clooney, and others perform one or two songs. Some are in black and white from the 1950s, others are in color at a recent "My Music" concert. We see LaRosa young and old, Frankie Laine and Tony Martin in their 90s, and a vintage appearance by Dominic Modugno on Ed Sullivan's "Toast of the Town." The program includes fund-raising breaks for PBS and Keely Smith looking bored while Louis Prima goes over the top.
