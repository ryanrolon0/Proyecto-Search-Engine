Shin chôjin densetsu Urotsukidôji

 In this sequel to Urotsukidoji sexual violence of the Overfiend and his cohorts from Hell continues to wreak havoc on the earth. Who can stop this relentless onslaught? Using the now famous Nazi Death-Rape machine, Dr Munhihausen Sr. is calling forth the Overfiend, but the experiment goes wildly wrong. Now taking over for his father, Munhihausen Jr. is poised to try again. Using a new stronger machine, alloys & improved engines... Will he succeed in killing the Overfiend, then taking control over Earth....?!? Before Amano and Megumi Jyaku began their search for the Overfiend, The Nazis attempted to summon The it's natural enemy, The Lord of Chaos, using a perverse sex machine designed to rape women and steal their lives. When the experiment fails, Nazi project leader Munhi Hausen is slain by Hitler, but the scientist's son continues his father's research and befriends Kohoki, a prisoner from the Machi, imprisoned for having an affair with Megumi. Munhi Hausen the Second and Kohoki have begun a series of capturing young women in order to re-enact the failed Nazi experiment and destroy the Overfiend. To lure Nagumo into their trap, Kohoki and Munhi Hausen use Nagumo's cousin Takyaki as their key. Nearing death from a plane crash, Nagumo donates his blood to save Takyaki's life. But, Takyaki receives some of Nagumo's powers and has become a puppet for Munhi Hausen to manipulate. To complicate things, Megumi has fallen for Takyaki, and Nagumo is now faced with stopping Takyaki from destroying himself. Amano is caught in the middle, especially after learning about the prophecy of The Lord of Chaos, which predates The Legend of The Overfiend. Megumi and Nagumo must now fight Takyaki, against their will, to help him before it's to late.
