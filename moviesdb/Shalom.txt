Shalom

 Shalom is a story about the granddaughter of a Nazi SS officer who attempts to return a piece of jewelry to the family of a Jewish man who was executed at Auschwitz. The symbolic necklace, a hamsa, was taken, as a bribe, in order to save the man's 7 year old daughter from going with him to the gas chamber.
