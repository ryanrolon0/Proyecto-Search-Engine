Something for Stevie

 Stevie, a young man with Down syndrome trying to make it in the work-a-day world. He finds rejection at every turn until he finally lands a job in a Truck Stop Diner as a busboy. As the employees, truckers, and customers experience his open, friendly and non-judgmental ways, he eventually wins everybody over, but not be before being the brunt of taunts, tricks, and even being beat-up and robbed. He discovers love along the way, but must face even his parents' nonacceptance, and blocks by the Church and the State.
