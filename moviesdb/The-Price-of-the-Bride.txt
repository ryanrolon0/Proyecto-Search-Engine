The Price of the Bride

 After a KGB agent defects to the US, the CIA has the job of not only taking from him his dowry of information (ie. the price of the bride), but also making sure he isn't a 'plant' to uncover secrets from us. All of this is complicated when it is suspected that another man is the real agent, and the defector but a decoy.
