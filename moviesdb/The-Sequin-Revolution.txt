The Sequin Revolution

 Joyous, colourful and energetic, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is one of the most spectacular events of its kind in the world. Few people know that the festival has a dark and disturbing origin. Through the eyes of those who were there, The Sequin Revolution brings you back to the heart of that eventful night in June 1978. Original 78ers who were part of the marching crowd of some 3,000 pioneers speak frankly about the night that changed their lives. What was meant to be a peaceful demonstration to commemorate the Stonewall incident spiralled into a long night of confrontation, brutality and solidarity. Over a hundred men and women were arrested when police closed off streets and swooped down on the parade, pulling hair, dragging limbs and punching faces. It was a time of fear, confusion and violence. But it also ignited camaraderie, passion and courage. The interviews and archival footage reconstruct a turning point in Australia's history of gay politics and ongoing crusade for equality.
