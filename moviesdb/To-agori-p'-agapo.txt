To agori p' agapo

 Liza, a coquettish and cunning girl who works in a bookstore, is a big fan of a master heart-breaker and star of the cinema. On a whim, she invades his life and messes it up, as she evokes the justified jealously of his wife. Two years later, the little monster becomes a woman, and when she meets him again, she literally drives him crazy. He asks her to marry him - having obtained a divorce from his wife. A charming lightweight comedy with musical touches.
