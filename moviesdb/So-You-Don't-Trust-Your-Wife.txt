So You Don't Trust Your Wife

 When his wife Alice questions Joe as to whether his insurance policy is paid up, he begins to see a plot to murder him in everything she does. He shakes and sweats when he hears Alice discussing how to use an axe with the handyman; when she orders a gun for his birthday; when he finds a box of rat poison and even when she offers to rub his neck. Soon, Joe has been committed to a sanitarium for hallucinations.
