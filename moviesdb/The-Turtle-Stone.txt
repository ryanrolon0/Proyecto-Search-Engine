The Turtle Stone

 This historical drama takes us to the Abbott Farm site on the Delaware River in New Jersey. It starts out as just another class trip for Alex (accompanied by his Dad), and his friends, but we learn through "meeting" Charles Abbott, Dorothy Cross, Ernest Volk, and exploring the 10,000 year old Lenape archaeological dig, that Alex' Dad (George), discovers as much about himself, as he does about Native Americans who inhabited New Jersey.
