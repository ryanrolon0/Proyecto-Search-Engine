The Bumblebee Man

 The Bumblebee Man is the English Prince of a court known as the Apiary. He is in the throws of woe since the death of his Mother... until a stranger wanders to the Apiary gates. And so begins an epic tragedy of war, true love, deceit, heroin, and the struggle to maintain royal lineage.
