Wavelengths

 Wavelengths is a short dramatic film about the time honoured quest for love and human intimacy. This stylish, witty and warm movie set in gay bars, in dreams, in adverts and cyberspace delights in the gloss of the world it depicts as it explores one womans foray into cybersex looking for emotionally safer sex.
