The Silent Realm

 A test of will and power. A mark of manhood. For hundreds of years stones have been a measure of strength. Special stones called Clach Cuid Firs, Gaelic for Manhood Stones, are part of an ancient tradition in which a young man would test his strength and resolve by attempting to lift one off the ground. Young men and seasoned athletes still journey to isolated valleys and remote villages to lift Scotland's famous stones of strength, partaking of this centuries-old ritual. This ancient tradition is explained by Peter Martin, who has devoted his life to the research and lifting of Scotland's Manhood Stones.
