 It's Tuesday and Maggie is on the prowl for single-use sex partner at her local hunting ground, the video store. Hapless video nerd Ted tries, as always, to curry favor with Maggie, but she needs more intrigue. She needs more of a man. Enter Nick. Maggie courts Nick, while they browse the Tinto Brass collection. They go to Maggie's to watch Salon Kitty and make love on the couch. The morning after, Maggie wakes with out the usual sense of dread that comes with a hangover and making small talk with a stranger whom you've had mediocre sex. Maggie, uncharacteristically, wants to see Nick again. Nick invites Maggie to dinner at his house. When Maggie arrives, Nick has something to show...something that takes Maggie completely by surprise.
