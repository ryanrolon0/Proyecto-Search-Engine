Razan

 A woman whose face is covered by a burqa addresses a video camera with her martyr speech as she prepares for a suicide mission. A male colleague wires a bomb around her waist. He reminds her that martyrs go to heaven and that soon she will be reunited with her sister. She says she is not afraid. She takes off the burqa, applies lipstick and puts on a bulky sweater. She is Razan. She practices smiling. Wearing a black watch cap and a jacket, she enters a busy subway station in New York City. Will she go through with it?
