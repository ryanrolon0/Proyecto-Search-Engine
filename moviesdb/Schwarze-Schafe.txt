Schwarze Schafe

 "Black Sheep" is about urban Berlin Lifestyle. About a bunch of hopeless losers, who are trying, to get the big money with the strangest plans. There is a Ex-Handmodel for Rolex, who wants to seduce a yuppie girl and cheat his insurance company. There is a East-German woman and her drunken artist boyfriend playing Lotto. Some satanists, who are planing a ritual with there grandmother. Two young anarchists, who are testing a new kind of Ego-economy. And last, but not least, three horny Turkish boys, who are stealing cash, to meet a prostitute. A lighthearted, stylish comedy in a electric Berlin, full of surreal moments. About material illusions and true love.
