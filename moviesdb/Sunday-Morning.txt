Sunday Morning

 Four friends getting together for a high school reunion in Las Vegas, taking advantage of the party town, and coincidentally staying in the wrong hotel. The hotel owner/manager and his wife, Charlie, run scams on unassuming guests to earn lavish money that the bankrupt hotel fails to collect. The hotel owner plants a seemingly dead stripper (Charlie) in the crew's hotel room, which forces the friends to come up with a ridiculous scheme of robbing a bank to cover the huge amount of hush money in two weeks. Samantha develops a gambling addiction and is forced into Gamblers Anonymous. Failing to meet their deadline, a two-week extension is granted so long as they pay the vigorish (vig). This debt accumulation keeps the friends intertwined as, in each new episode, they contrive new outrageous schemes to make money fast.
