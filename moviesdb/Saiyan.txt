 An unusual, tragic saga of star-crossed lovers and a family caught in the calamitous backwash of a forsaken romance. An orphaned village girl is given shelter in a respected home and wooed by the two sons of the family. This, combined with the headstrong, impulsive nature of the younger son, leads to a uniquely disastrous three-way relationship that ruins and ultimately destroys the family.
