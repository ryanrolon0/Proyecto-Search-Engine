Tom Thumb in the Land of the Giants

 A bizarre and prophetic adventure in which a young boy is chased by a masked phantom holding a severed arm in a graveyard. Images of twin towers in which the boy enters and falls surrounded by incandescent panels of light and debris seem to prophesy the World Trade Center disaster. An man with one arm appears and is handed the severed arm by the phantom. Then a giant woman appears enveloping the boy. An unsettling and delerious apocalyptic atmosphere pervades the movie, designed as a trailer for a "film of the future."
