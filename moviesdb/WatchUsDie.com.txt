WatchUsDie.com

 If you saw what you thought was a murder on the Internet, what would you do? Who would you call? That's the premise behind the new movie "www.WatchUsDie.Com,". Set in a voyeur site called WatchUsDorm, the movie watches the lives (and deaths) of the eight women living in the house. These girls are live, 24 hours a day, seven days a week--until they begin to die. The first "live" Internet death occurs around midnight, when Pia takes a gainer down the main stairs of the WatchUsDorm mansion. Was it an accident, or a deliberate murder? No one knows, but more people than ever are watching, and the next day, T-shirts are being sold memorializing Pia's life and death. Soon, another girl dies. This time Sara in the hot tub. A banner remembering Pia and Sara appears on the site. The members are devastated, but the show must go on. Life continues as normal, or as normal as it can be when 45 cameras are watching your every move. Another resident turns up missing, and then another dies in the shower, her head smashed to pieces against the tiles of the shower stall. A killer is on the loose at WatchUsDorm.com, and suddenly the name of the site switches to WatchUsDie.com. Who do you call? What do you do? You don't know where the house is, or even if what you are watching is real, or a new millennium version of "War of the Worlds."...
