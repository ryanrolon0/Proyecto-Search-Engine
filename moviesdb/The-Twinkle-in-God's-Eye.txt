The Twinkle in God's Eye

 Reverend Macklin is headed for Lodestone where his father was killed 25 years before when the Indians burnt down the church. He plans to rebuild the church and minister to the people, but all he seems to do is stop the gambling at the Silver Palace Saloon. Marty wants him to build on the other side of town and will finance the new church if Macklin moves, but he will not. When Marty is robbed by a gang of outlaws one of them hides the money in the church altar. Macklin finds that he has been ordered to San Diego due to his lack of accomplishment, and it might take a miracle for him to stay.
