The Muse

 This short story is about personal transformation and the creative process. There is one person, but a couple of different personalities; one who reminds, one who wishes she could ignore. Late at night, when attention is elsewhere, the Reminder slips in. Her message has been heard before, too many times. What is a Wishful Thinker to do? Make something else out of it. Drawing on hidden resources, the Wishful Thinker moves into high speed to create ...something. Perhaps not perfect, not ideal, but... pleasing.
