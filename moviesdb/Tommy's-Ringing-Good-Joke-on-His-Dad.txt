Tommy's Ringing Good Joke on His Dad

 "One of the big comedy hits of the Biograph. Scene lady washing and old gentleman dozing by the fire. While his mother is out doors hanging up the clothes, Tommy ties a cord to the back of his father's chair, and attaches the other end to a towel in the washtub. His mother returns, puts the towel in the wringer, and as the cord tightens it pulls the old man's chair over, and as he falls with a crash he pulls the tub of water over and upon him. The scene is full of action and very amusing."
