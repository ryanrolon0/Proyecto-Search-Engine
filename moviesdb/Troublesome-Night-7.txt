Troublesome Night 7

 A film crew travels to the Hong Kong countryside to make an 'MTV' show. During their stay at the village, the crew hears eerie and horrific voices during the night and witnesses a phantom roaming around the premises. In addition, some feel that their feet were being tickled while in the water performing. The villagers attest that their territory does not have supernatural beings but when a mysterious tramp and an old lady, familiar with the village's history, intercede, standpoints are changed.
