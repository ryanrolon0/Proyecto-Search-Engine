The Road to Margaritaville

 Written and shot over the course of a year, 'The Road to Margaritaville' is a meditation, by definition, of a story that director Jason Underhill was told nearly a decade ago about a friend from high school who misread the television footage of the September 11 attacks as scenes from a movie - the film continues and reflects on that original thought. 'Reflection' is being read as a Lacanian device, entirely divorced from contemplation or understanding; as a way of witnessing the distortions of reality and misrecognizing them as complete; as a description of everything beyond our scope of vision; as a frame. In 'The Road to Margaritaville', the camera occupies this position, redirecting the satire into a more analytic engagement with irony.
