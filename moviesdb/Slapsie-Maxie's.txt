Slapsie Maxie's

 When a waiter accidentally KOs boxing champ Tiger Dorsey in Slapsie Maxie's nightclub, Rosenbloom arranges a boxing match between the reluctant waiter and the champ. Because of his ease-of-footwork and skillful manipulation of the serving trays as a waiter, "Scat" the waiter catches the attention of night-club owner Maxie Rosenbloom. That very night, Rosenbloom makes quick work of his opponent in the fight-ring and returns to his club. As he enters, he is knocked out by "Scat" who has carelessly wielded a tray right into Maxie's chin. Onlookers believe the knock-out was the result of a legit fist-punch, and 'Scat" is forced into a bout with the champ in a roped-off section of the club.
