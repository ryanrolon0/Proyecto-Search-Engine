So You Want to Be a Handy Man

 Joe MacDoakes' next-door neighbor, Marvin, comes over to help him fix his lawn-sprinkling system, but they get the pipes crossed with the gas-line and almost asphyxiate themselves. They then decide to paint the living-room table, and end-up painting the whole house trying to cover their mistakes. Marvin accidentally gets Joe caught in the washing machine, thinks he is seeing him on a television set, goes home and leaves Joe to tumble-and-rinse.
