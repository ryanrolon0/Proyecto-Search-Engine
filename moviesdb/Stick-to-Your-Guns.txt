Stick to Your Guns

 The Bar 20 boys are after Nevada and his gang of cattle rustlers. Hoppy and California join Nevada's gang under assumed names. Johnny and the rest of Bar 20 get directions from Winters and head out looking for Hoppy's signal. But Winters wanders on ahead and gets spotted. This lets Nevada trap them in a canyon and to make matters worse, Hoppy's masquerade has been exposed. All the Bar-20 cowhands gather to aid one of the former Bar-20 riders who is systematically being rustled of his cattle herd by a gang of rustlers operating out of the Black Buttes. "Hopalong" Cassidys plan is for him and grizzled "California" Carlson to work their way into the gang, while their young sidekick, Johnny Nelson---sorry, "Lucky" isn't in this 'un---assembles the others at the ranch and awaits a smoke signal from Cassidy to attack the bandit stronghold. A former Bar 20 cowhand is now a cattle rancher and having trouble with rustlers. Hoppy and the Bar 20 gang ride in and surround the the bad guys. June Winters joins the posse and serves as the romantic partner for posse co-leader Lucky.
