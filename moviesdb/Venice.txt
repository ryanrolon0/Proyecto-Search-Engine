Venice

 A decaying urban canal system. A crooked scheme to turn the waterways into the next Venice. A small-time hood named Chick who disappears with a bag full of bribe money... Stalked by a bizarre pair of killers, Chick soon discovers that the only thing more dangerous than no getaway plan is one that's too clever lot like Chick into unwittingly taking the fall for them. Or at least, that's the plan...
