The Cowboy Star

 Movie cowboy star Spencer Yorke, tired of the Hollywood life, refuses to sign the new contract offered him by producer Jack Kingswell, and he and his pal Buckshot go to Arizona in search of a ranch to buy. The cowtown of Taylorsville is so dull that Sheriff Clem Baker bemoans the lack of criminal activity, and his daughter Mary, a real estate agent, finds the town equally boring. Her kid brother Jimmy, a big fan of Spencer Yorke, tries to persuade his father to let him visit "Ghost Town," nearby and deserted. Upon his arrival, Jimmy recognizes Spencer, but he insists his name is George Weston. Mary discovers his true identity when she sells him a ranch, but she gives him a pledge of secrecy. Three big-city gangsters, Johnny Sampson, Pretty-Boy Hogan and "Midget", fleeing their latest crime, are hiding out in the closed saloon in "Ghost Town." Jimmy, disobeying his father, rides into the town and is taken prisoner by the criminals as they believe he has been sent to spy on them. They plan to ambush and kill the Sheriff and Yorke, whom they think is a G-man, when they come looking for the boy.
