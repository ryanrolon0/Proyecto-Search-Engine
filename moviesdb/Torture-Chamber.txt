Torture Chamber

 A Catholic priest, devoted to saving his family, tries to cure his deranged younger brother -- but 13-year-old Jimmy Morgan is possessed by an evil too powerful to be exorcised by any religion. After escaping from a mental institution, Jimmy is back with a vengeance -- and an army of horribly burned children who follow his every murderous desire. The New England town trembles in fear as Jimmy and his deadly young followers attack and abduct its residents -- innocent and guilty alike -- dragging their victims to an abandoned castle and subjecting them to grisly torments deep within its underground tunnels. Those who discover the terrible secret behind the disappearances and deaths don't live long enough to tell it. The teacher, the doctor, even Jimmy's own brother and mother, will all confront their fates in the Torture Chamber.
