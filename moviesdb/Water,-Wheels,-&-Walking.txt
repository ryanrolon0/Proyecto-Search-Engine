Water, Wheels, & Walking

 A satirical narrative following David Guida as he travels from his house on Staten Island to the Bronx High School of Science. This grueling journey is done every day, and this short takes the viewer along for the ride. By using busses, subways, lots of walking, and a ferryboat(!) he finally gets to school. Along the way comparisions are made to, Abraham Lincoln, walking to school "500 miles a day, with no shoes, up hill both ways, with his brother on his back" and never missing a day.
