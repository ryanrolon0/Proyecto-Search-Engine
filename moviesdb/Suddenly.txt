Suddenly

 The tranquility of a small town is marred only by sheriff Tod Shaw's unsuccessful courtship of widow Ellen Benson, a pacifist who can't abide guns and those who use them. But violence descends on Ellen's household willy-nilly when the U.S. President passes through town... and slightly psycho hired assassin John Baron finds the Benson home ideal for an ambush. The President of the United States will be arriving by train in the town of Suddenly where he plans to then be driven to a nearby lodge. The Sheriff, Tod Shaw, has everything under control and with the assistance of the State Police, has set up a reasonable security plan. Soon however, Shaw is taken prisoner by John Baron in the home of Pop Benson. Baron and his henchmen gained access to Benson's home by posing as FBI agents. The house provides perfect line of sight to the train station and Baron is there for only one reason simply a killer for hire but it's left to the Sheriff, Benson and Benson's daughter-in-law Ellen to stop him.
