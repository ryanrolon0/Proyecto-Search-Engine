Twilight Zone

 Four directors collaborated to remake four episodes of the popular television series 'The Twilight Zone' for this movie. The episodes are updated slightly and in color (the television show was in black-and-white), but very true to the originals, where eerie and disturbing situations gradually spin out of control. Four horror/science-fiction segments directed by four of Hollywood's famous directors based on TV's most popular anthology series, bookened by a funny and scary prologue and epilogue. In the first story (a vague remake of the Twilight Zone episode "A Quality of Mercy"), a loud-mouthed bigoted businessman with an intense hatred for Jews, blacks, and Asians, gets the tables turned on him when he walks out a bar and is inexplicably transported back in time to being pursued by Nazis in 1940's France, then as an African-American at a KKK rally in the 1950s Deep South, and as a Vietnamese in 1960s Vietnam. In the second story (a remake of 'Kick the Can'), an old man arrives at a retirement home and makes the wishes of the residents come true when he magically transforms them into youthful incarnations of their days gone by. In the third story (a remake of 'It's a Good Life'), a young woman on the road gives a ride to a mysterious 10-year-old boy to his house and ends up trapped with other people in an alternate reality created by the boy's imagination. The fourth story (a remake of 'Nightmare at 20,000 Feet) features a passenger on an airline whom sees, but cannot convince anyone, a mysterious creature on the outside wing of the airplane trying to sabotage the aircraft.
