Sour Apple Freeze Pop

 Struggling to finish an original stage play and living under the conditional financial support of his father, 23 year old Darrell Schicker is at the crossroads of change. His best friends, Francis and John from Guam- both clinging to adolescence- have become like a ball and chain, keeping Darrell mired in the past. Francis's mother Brenda, happy to usher her son's friends through sexual rites of passage, is an ever-present distraction. Things seem to brighten when Darrell falls in love with Victoria, but she ultimately rejects him at a time when he simultaneously loses his job and his father's financial support. This luckless sequence of events works on Darrell like a time bomb.
