The Plumber's Picnic

 Newbride refuses to allow his hired girl to go to the plumbers' picnic with Mr. Fitter, a plumber. A pipe bursts in Newbride's home and Fitter won't fix it until Newbride says he will let the hired girl go to the picnic; but there are some lively happenings before this situation comes to hand.
