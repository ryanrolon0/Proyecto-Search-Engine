Preet Ki Dori

 Govind lives a wealthy lifestyle in Pritampur. When his father was dying, he made Govind promise that he would always obey his mother. Years later, Govind has completed his studies and returns home. While hunting, Radha, who comes from a poor family, rescues him from a snake, and both fall in love with each other. When Radha's widower father, Madhav Chaudhary, comes to know, he approaches Govind's mother, but she rejects Radha and humiliates Madhav. Govind and his mother then re-locate to the city where she plans to get him married to wealthy Reeta, the only daughter of Dayal Singh, while a heartbroken Radha must now ready herself to be married to money-lender, Banke Bihari.
