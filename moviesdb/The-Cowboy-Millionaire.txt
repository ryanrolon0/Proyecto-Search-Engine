The Cowboy Millionaire

 Bob and Persimmon's job on a dude ranch is to fake a stage holdup for new arrivals. When the trio of Pamela, Henrietta, and Hadley arrive from England, Bob takes an interest in Pamela while Hadley makes plans to con Bob and Persimmon out of their gold mine. Bob Walker ('George O'Brien' (qv)), cowboy and guide at El Reposo Dude Ranch, is about to leave with his pal "Persimmon" Bates ('Edgar Kennedy' (qv)), to work a mining claim they own jointly. On their last assignment, they use a stagecoach and fake a holdup to thrill the arriving guests; Pamela Barclay ('Evalyn Bostock' (qv)), pampered English heiress; her Aunt Henrietta ('Maude Allen (I)' (qv)) and Pamela's fiancEe Hadley Thornton ('Alden 'Stephen' Chase' (qv)). Pamela expresses indignation but inwardly admires Bob. Thornton,a cad from the word go whose only interest in Pamela is concentrated on her money. He learns of the mine and plans to acquire it at a low price. Bob receives word, as part of Hadley's plan, that he is needed at the mine. While he is gone, cadley Hadley persuades "Persimmon" to sell the mine, and the entire party sails for England, where the deal is to be closed. Bob returns, and is incensed and packs to follow them, hoping to arrive in time to prevent "Persimmon" from selling the, now valuable, mine. Meanwhile, Pamela has become aware of Hadley's non-Cricket deal and Hadley imprisons her before she can get to "Persimmon."
