S

 Filmmaker Ronen Amar (''My Family's Pizza'') documents two protagonists whose only common denominator is the sleepy southern town they come from. Amar follows his cousin Eyal, a successful architect-contractor who decides to run for mayor and kick up dust. He also follows his friend Koko, a stoner on an eternal soul search. With local elections raging in the background, Amar's protagonists stand at critical junctures in their lives. How will their s[elections] shape the director's future as well?
