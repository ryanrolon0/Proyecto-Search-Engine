The Price of Air

 In the idyllic suburban distopia of Orange, the affable but clueless Paul agrees to be a drug courier for Mr. Ball who's about to take delivery of a drug rumored to be "more addictive than air." Against the better judgment of his best friend D., Paul does the deal for quick cash, but the supplier turns on him and murders D. in the ensuing shootout. Paul goes on the lam with the cash and the stash, but only after promising his dying friend that he'll flush it before Ball puts them in the street. Now, on the run, Paul meets the lonely, beautiful Anne with whom he indulges in the drug. They discover its curious effects, each becoming leery of the other even as they are falling in love. The fallout from the binge and the arrival of one of Ball's vengeful colleagues ultimately forces the couple to confront their demons. Take a trip to the Real Los Angeles, a place where the shimmering exterior conceals a drug culture hungrily awaiting the next new thing. Also starring Michelle Phillips and Dick Van Patten.
