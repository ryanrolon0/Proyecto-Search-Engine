The Third Wheel

 At what point does loyalty go too far? In this look at the lives of two boyhood friends, the line between loyalty and codependency becomes blurred. Joe has been Howard's best friend since grade school and always been there for Howard, bailing him out of trouble on many occasions. Joe becomes concerned with the life Howard leads with girlfriend, Gwen. She does not take her relationship with Howard as seriously as Joe takes his. As tension between Gwen and Joe grow, Howard sees a life with Gwen, and consequently without Joe, as a breath of fresh air. Joe, determined not to lose the friend that has become his family, embarks on a path to ensure Howard's loyalty. No matter the cost.
