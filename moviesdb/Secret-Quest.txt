Secret Quest

 For the first time ever the Gnostics tell their own story. This series goes beyond an historical account of Gnosticism and delves into the mysteries of Gnosis itself. It is the first of its kind where Gnostics themselves make known the esoteric practices used to attain Gnosis, walk the hidden path, and reach wisdom, inner peace and enlightenment.
