Profetia

 "Profetia" is a metaphysical Multi-plot epic about love, life and death in the harsh North West parts of Copenhagen. A woman stands by a fire, burning the stories about love she has written down over the course of a lifetime. One by one her stories seem to come true and converge around her. People, bound by love & blood, will meet and confront each other over the course of one single day. Can they change what seems to be written?
