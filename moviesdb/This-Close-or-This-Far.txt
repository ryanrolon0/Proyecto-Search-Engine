This Close or This Far

 'This Close or This Far' is boxing love story that takes place in the streets of San Francisco and the abandoned docks of Oakland. It follows the melancholy boxer Momo and his attempt to win back the heart of a former student, the beautiful, troubled Alice. He reminisces the rise and fall of his fling with the then-grieving Alice, which unfolds like a boxing montage, or a Woody Allen montage. Stars Steve 'Zumbi' Gaines of the popular underground hip-hop duo 'Zion I'.
