Tears of a King

 In the last days of the life of Elvis Presley, he struggles to overcome the effects on his body and soul of prescription drug abuse and personal mistakes in his lifestyle. In flashback sequences similar to Dickens's "A Christmas Carol", Elvis is guided by a "Mysterious Man" to re-examine turning points in the life he has led. These reflections lead to recognition, realization, repentance, and ultimately ... redemption. -- based on true events
