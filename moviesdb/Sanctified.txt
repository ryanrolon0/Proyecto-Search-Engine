Sanctified

 In a sadomasochistic world, driven by the devil, spiritual warfare is an everyday occurrence. Angelo (Eddie Bolero), a suicidal young fighter plummeting through living hell, dives head first into doom and demise. The beautiful and spiritually tormented Marie (Tania Aleman), communicates bitterly with her sin-ridden lover. Domestic disputes abound. Angels and demons clash in the home of a relationship gone sour, a love/hate triangle manifests, with lust and violence in the center. Angelo is powerless as religion, the relentless beauty of woman, and his own desire for demise blast him from every angle.
