The Son of Tarzan

 The scenario follows the book closely. Tarzan's son Jack (Korak to the apes) is kidnapped from England by Tarzan's old enemy Paulovich. He escapes into the African jungle with the help of Paulovich's trained ape Akut. There he meets Meriem, a white girl held by Arabs. He frees her and falls in love. Meriem (who is really an heiress) is sought by Paulovich. Tarzan arrives with Jane at his African estate and intervenes.
