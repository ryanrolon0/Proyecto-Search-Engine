The Corrections

 A student adaptation of a small section from Jonathan Franzen's 'The Corrections', the film follows a college professor after he spends several wild nights with one of his undergraduate students. Associate Professor Chip Lambert was about to attain the culmination of all his academic efforts things at the university begin to go wrong, however, he succumbs to his own weaknesses and the manipulations of Melissa Paquette, a young, entitled and supercilious undergrad. Awakening in a Chicago motel room on Thanksgiving morning with the realization that the life he has worked so hard to create is about to take a dark turn, Chip is forced to acknowledge what he has been avoiding for quite some time.
