Raw Nerve

 Jimmy Clayton is a race car driver who has visions of the murders that have been happening locally. The police do not believe him and he is not aware of what is happening to him. When he has a vision of his sister Gina being murdered, he needs to make an investigation of his own. With the help of local reporter Gloria Freedman, Jimmy tries to determine who the murderer is and analyse his visions. Nobody believes that Jimmy Clayton is innocent after he reveals intricate details about two unsolved murders--things only the killer could know. Although he claims he saw the killings in strange, disjointed visions, the police begin to stack a case against him...until Jimmy reveals that his own sister is the serial killer's next target. As the cops rush to protect her, the race is on to identify a killer who lies very, very close...and who is ready to strike even closer.
