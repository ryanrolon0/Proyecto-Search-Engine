Side by Side

 In the arresting rural environs of the western part of Danish Jutland, a feud has been raging between two neighbors who have not spoken in 15 years. Two giant hedges separate their properties. Mr. Frost, a senior, lives on one side with his handicapped wife. On the other side lives Mr. Jepsen, a middle aged man and father of three. The director, one of Jepsen's sons, sets out to uncover the source of the animosity between the two warring men.
