The Tutor - Sensei

 THE TUTOR tells the story of a man escaping his life in America, teaching English in Tokyo, who becomes emotionally involved in the lives of his Japanese students. In each of them he sees a part of the man he has always been and from each of them he learns about the man he wants to become. His students are a businessman struggling with the emptiness of his life, a college student struggling to fit in, a high school student searching for a meaningful relationship, a young boy terrified of life and a young woman determined to break free, who dreams of escaping to a life in America and with whom the American falls in love. For the two of them to be together, he must follow her to the country he is trying to forget and to a life he is trying to leave behind.
