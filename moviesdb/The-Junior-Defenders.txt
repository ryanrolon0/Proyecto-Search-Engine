The Junior Defenders

 THE JUNIOR DEFENDERS is a fast-paced, quirky, cult-style comedy about the cast of a fictional 1970s hit television show. With a fan base that rivals Star Trek's, "The Junior Defenders" is one of the top TV hits of the late 1970s. Every kid in America dreams of being one of the show's crime-fighting kid superheroes. Twenty-five years after the show's sudden cancellation, a crazed fan named Norman Nields is still obsessed with the show. In his mania, Norman goes on a mission to travel across the country in a stolen Winnebago, kidnapping the four washed-up former child stars from his beloved childhood program. The kidnappings spark a national media frenzy. Once in Hollywood, Norman takes over a soundstage and forces the cast at gunpoint to act in his brand-new episode of "The Junior Defenders".
