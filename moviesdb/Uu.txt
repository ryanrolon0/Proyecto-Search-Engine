Uu

 Uu explores Whitehorse s namesake, the once-existent rapids of Miles Canyon. Like many other cities, Whitehorse is named after a land form that has since disappeared. Local tourism narratives compensate for this loss by praising how the Hydro-Electric Dam tamed the mighty waters. Uu adopts this fictitious narrative, demonstrating how Gold miners might need a dam to save them.
