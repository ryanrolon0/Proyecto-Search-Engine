 Jarito is a young boy living all alone in a dusty junkyard. His only link to the past is a strange golden disk. Then one day a mysterious piece of junk falls from the sky bearing similar markings to that of his disk. But before Jarito can examine the junk further, he gets interrupted by another strange machine that has come from up above. This story is only part one of a three part mini trilogy expected to be released over several months apart.
