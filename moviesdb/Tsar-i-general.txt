Tsar i general

 The film focuses on the conflict between General Vladimir Zaimov, a fervent patriot and Slavophile, and the Bulgarian tsar Boris III. This is essentially a political and ideological conflict in which are also involved personal motives, affinities and antagonism. Zaimov is opposed to the official policy of the Palace, which intends to drag Bulgaria into the war against the Soviet Union. Though unofficially this step is being postponed, Zaimov - who has secretly been in contact with the Russians - is detained, charged with treason and sentenced to death by a firing squad.
