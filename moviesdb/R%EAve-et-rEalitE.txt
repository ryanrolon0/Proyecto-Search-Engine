Rêve et rEalitE

 A well-dressed man pours a glass of Champagne for a young woman who is sitting with him at a dining table. She's costumed, wearing a mask and cape. He removes the mask and cape, revealing a smiling beauty. He takes her in his arms to kiss her; she cooperates. The dream ends, and reality intrudes in the form of an old couple in bed, he kissing her, she enthusiastically willing. He realizes he's back in reality. Is the kiss at an end?
