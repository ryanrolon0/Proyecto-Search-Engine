Super Bowl XXXV

 The New York Giants of the NFC faced the AFC champion Baltimore Ravens in the 35th renewal of professional football's AFC-NFC World Championship Game. The Giants were heavy favorites based on their two previous Superbowl titles, but Baltimore, returning to the Superbowl for the first time since 1971 when the Colts made the city home, had a team whose defense was considered among the strongest ever seen.
