Tough Assignment

 Don Reilly, a Los Angeles newspaper reporter in 1949, recently married to Margie, a photographer employed by the same newspaper, stumbles upon the fact that gangsters are forcing butcher shops to sell their unlicensed beef, and he persuades his managing editor to allow him to follow up on the story. His bride goes with him on an investigation that leads him to the ranch hideout of the gang, who are rustling cattle using fast, refrigeration trucks.
