Sailor Mouse

 A little mouse runs away from home and goes to sea. Aboard the ship, a rat starts to educate the mouse on the ways of sea-farin' mice by sending him to the galley to steal cheese from the Captain's table. But the Captain's parrot, a sea-goin' snitch, spots the thievery and squawks loud and long about it. That brings the whole crew down after the mouse, who gets away and learns that there is no place like home.
