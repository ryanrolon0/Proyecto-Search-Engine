Shankar Dada

 Dreaded gangster Babubhai is involved in all possible criminal activities. Of late his activities are being sabotaged by a fellow criminal named Shankar Dada. Babubhai entraps him with the help of beautiful Bindiya, and gets him on his side with a 50-50 partnership, to which Shankar agrees. Babubhai comes to know that Shankar has a look-alike brother named Ram, who is a police inspector, and has been assigned to this area to put a stop to all criminal activities. Babubhai asks Shankar to copy Ram's mannerisms, and replace him at the police station, which will make Babubhai's criminal syndicate virtually unstoppable, to which Shankar agrees. Ram is abducted and held by Babubhai, while Shankar replaces him at the police station, not realizing that these actions are going to change their lives forever.
