Twenty Ten

 Howard likes Grace, Grace likes Felix, Felix likes Samantha. At least he did until she got all serious. But mostly Felix just wants to help his hapless friend Howard pluck up the courage to talk to the girl of his dreams. When she mistakes Howard for a DJ, the perfect plan is hatched. Or perfectly inept, as it turns out. The new Australian comedy Twenty Ten tracks these four misbegotten twenty-somethings as they bicker, snicker and search for a life beyond each other and the deadbeat suburban Sydney street where they all work. A life somewhere cool. Somewhere like Twenty Ten...
