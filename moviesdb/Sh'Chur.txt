Sh'Chur

 This movie portrays the colourful and passionate culture of the Moroccan community in Israel. It tells the story of 13-year-old Rachel, a thoroughly Westernized Sabra teenager who struggles to make sense of and come to terms with the white magic (Sh'Chur) practiced regularly by members of her family. This mystical world of spirits and demons takes on a physical presence in the shape of her elder sister Pnina, whose supernatural powers fill Rachel with fear.
