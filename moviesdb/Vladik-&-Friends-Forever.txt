Vladik & Friends Forever

 This is the conclusion in the series of Azov Films featuring Vladik. Here he and his friends go camping in the woods. As he did in a previous film, Vladik explores some more caves with his friends. The day is topped off with a visit to the sauna -- featured also in previous films. Finally, we see Vlad performing some music.
