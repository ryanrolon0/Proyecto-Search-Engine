SciFi Summer Girl's Off Day

 An independent Science Fiction-action-comedy short film about a heroine and her pet-sidekick mutant anole lizard, who try to take a day off in a park. Unfortunately, it becomes an 'off day' instead, when an alien mercenary team appears, and tries to collect some human 'samples', forcing the heroes to respond. SciFi Summer Girl and Amadeus swing into action against the alien invaders, getting stunned but recovering in the process. In the end, SFS Girl and Amadeus defeat the alien mercenaries, at about which time the police arrive on the scene. The story was based on a comic strip story written by the producer for Sci Fi Summer Con Atlanta, then adapted to screenplay and script by the director, Adrian Havens. The characters, SFS Girl and Amadeus, in the original comic strip and film, were based on the original mascot characters of and for Sci Fi Summer Con Atlanta.
