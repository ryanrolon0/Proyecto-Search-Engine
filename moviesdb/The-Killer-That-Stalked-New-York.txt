The Killer That Stalked New York

 Sheila Bennett returns to New York from Cuba, carrying $40,000 worth of smuggled diamonds...and smallpox, which could start a devastating epidemic in the unprotected city. Treasury agent Johnson loses her but keeps doggedly on the trail; while Public Health doctor Wood searches in vain for the unknown person spreading the deadly disease far and wide. Meanwhile, the increasingly ill Sheila is only concerned with her faithless husband Matt, who plans to abscond with the diamonds... Sheila Bennett smuggles some diamonds, from Cuba, through the port of New York City but is unaware she is also bringing in a smallpox virus. Doctor can not diagnose the spreading disease quickly enough so by the time they discover what they are looking for, Sheila is free-spreading the virus through the city. While both the police department and the city-health department are looking for her, as a smuggler and virus-carrier, she is looking for her double-crossing husband.
