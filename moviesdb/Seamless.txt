 In this youth culture drama, J.B. is something of a Gen-X renaissance man. He's a club DJ, promotes raves, runs a pirate radio station, and manages a small but successful cutting-edge fashion boutique. Zink, J.B.'s partner in the boutique, claims to be his best friend, but deep inside he resents J.B. for his easy success in so many fields and the way others look up to him. Looking to gain a greater name for himself within the raver subculture, Zink begins selling what he claims is a naturally occurring psychotropic substance. When his friends learn the truth about Zink's product, it leads to an angry splintering among their circle. Meanwhile, J.B. becomes romantically involved with Nicole, which comes as quite a blow to Gigi, a mutual friend who had become infatuated with J.B.
