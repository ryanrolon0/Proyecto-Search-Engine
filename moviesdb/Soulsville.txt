Soulsville

 SOULSVILLE is an exuberant celebration of the soul, R&B, gospel, pop, rock, and funk music explosion that came barreling out of Memphis, TN, in the late '50s, '60s, and '70s. Standing in contrast to Motown's smooth cosmopolitan approach to melody, Stax Records epitomized the gritty, raw, stripped down sound experienced "the minute you crossed the Mason Dixon line." Stax's incredible roster of recording artists helped create and define "soul music." Such greats as Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Booker T. and the MG's, The Staple Singers, Carla and Rufus Thomas, and Black Moses himself, Isaac Hayes, were all launched at the studio on College and McLemore in Memphis. Originally produced as a documentary film for the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, SOULSVILLE contains rarely seen performance footage and interviews, and explores the roots of American soul music while relating the volatile history of Stax records. This film will have you out of your seat grooving to every soul record you ever loved.
