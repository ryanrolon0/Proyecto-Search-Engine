The Elephant's Bath

 This is a hit picture, one that will make good on any programme. It was taken in the Berlin Zoölogical Gardens, and shows one of the big elephants taking a bath. The huge animal rolls about in the pool with a tremendous splashing of water, and then walks out directly toward the camera. From a photographic point of view this film is beyond criticism.
