Stairway to Light

 Part of MGM's Passing Parade series, the focus is on Dr. Phillippe Pinel, head of an asylum during the time of the French Revolution. Pinel couldn't believe what he found on his first inspection of the facility. Several of the inmates had been there for 30 years or more and lived in horrible conditions, a prison rather than a hospital. He believed that the mentally could be cured and within two years of over a hundred inmates were released. His work was not popular and he was beaten on the street only to be rescued by one of the inmates he had released years before. This Passing Parade series entry tells the story of Dr. Phillipe Pinel (1745-1826), a French physician. When he was assigned to a government institution for the mentally ill, he was appalled at the conditions he found. People were treated like animals, chained in dark basement cells for decades. Dr. Pinel treated the patients with kindness and understanding. His then-unorthodox methods became the model for treating those with mental illness.
