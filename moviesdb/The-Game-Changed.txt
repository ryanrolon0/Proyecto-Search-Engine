The Game Changed

 A presentation of sexism and the exploitation of women from the 1940s and the 1950s. Film clips from this time period are used to provide a real reference that today may seem comical. The contrast between our lives and these clips can show us how our understanding of equality has advanced. Comparisons between this film and our experiences can show us how these injustices have changed.
