The Dancer

 14,000 miles. 100 degree heat. 4 day shoot. 2 man crew. 1 man cast. Shot on location in Dowlaiswaram, India, The Dancer shows life through the eyes of an 11-year-old orphan, Satish Kumar, a non-actor portraying himself and giving us unrestricted access into his world. The film was produced to raise awareness about homeless and abandoned children in India's remote Andhra Pradesh region. Satish and his friends live at Grace Children's Home and speak only Telugu. All dialogue was based solely on interviews with Satish, and direction was through a translator. Despite the communication barrier, a connection was made during production that transcends language and inspired all involved in this whirlwind project. Shot over a 4-day period by Seth Stark and Joshua Jouppi in 2010.
