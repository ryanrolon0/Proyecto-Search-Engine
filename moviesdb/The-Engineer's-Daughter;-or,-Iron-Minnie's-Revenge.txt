The Engineer's Daughter; or, Iron Minnie's Revenge

 A deliberately campy send-up of old rustic melodramas in which the villainous Lawyer Stebbins plots to gain control of land belonging to the cider-making Widow James. When he fails in his plot to marry his son Elmer to the widow's daughter, "Cinders," he kidnaps her fiancE, the heroic "Bill Brawney," and ties him to the railroad tracks. But Cinders used to help her father on the railroad, so she fires up the "Iron Minnie" and races to the rescue.
