The Half Life of Mason Lake

 How well do we handle tragedy and how well do we really know the people we love? The distance between better and worse is great, but if the one we love changes - is it also acceptable for our feelings and actions for and towards them to do the same? New Years Eve, 1999. Home from college for holiday break, Sarah Rosen and Mason Lake meet at a party and form an instant bond that turns quickly to love. They are soon married and prepared to begin a new and promising life together. When Mason suffers a severe brain injury, life is turned inside-out. He is left with a child's capacity, and his family is left holding the broken pieces of their former happiness. Sarah, now more caretaker than wife, must become an adult.
