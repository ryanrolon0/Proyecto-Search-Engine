Rock and Roll Fuck'n'Lovely

 The film is a dark and fantastical touring tale with a little rock n' roll on the side just for good measure. This is a road movie. this is a rock and roll drama, a tale that exposes the rumors surrounding a mythical festival tour (or is it just the drugs?). The cinematography is stunning, the drug taking shocking and the horror horrific, not for the faint hearted. It's a unique film capturing the true essence of the festival spirit, unlike any British film to date. This movie is the essence of a rock and roll nightmare. It's a must see for anyone who's been on the road.. and if you've not gone on tour before... after this you never will.
