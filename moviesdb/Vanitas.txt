Vanitas

 A fork and a knife fall in lust and, spurred by an accidental blunder, embark on a cooperative venture to remodel their world. All goes well, until the knife accidentally remodels its partner, the fork. The ensuing quarrel turns into an all-out warfare bringing their universe to its ultimate demise. A still-life comes to motion to turn the world of objects upside down. Vanitas means vanity. It is also the name of a Northern Renaissance painterly genre depicting the grace of affluence and the transience of earthly delights.
