The Trouble with Perpetual Deja-Vu

 Cape Cod is a lonely place in the winter. The tourists are gone, the cottages are shuttered. Danielle, a Cape Cod native, lives there with her husband Vince, who sells real estate. They are a young couple, but Danielle has a need to go astray. She finds an old boyfriend Joe, and proceeds to act out sexually but it's all right under Vince's nose. Is this marriage tenable?
