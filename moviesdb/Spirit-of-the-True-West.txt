Spirit of the True West

 Montague County, Texas-where Native Americans traded and raided, Chisholm Trail drovers crossed the Red River, and Daddy Joe Justin invented the cowboy boot--is, ultimately, where farmers, ranchers and oilmen tamed a place of big spirit and big stories. This short documentary chronicles county history as an introduction for visitors of the Tales 'N' Trails Museum in Nocona, Texas. Re-enactments and historical photos capture the essence of the museum's five cultural themes--Native American, Western Heritage, Leather Industry, Agriculture and Petroleum. The project uses local resources for narration, musical score, re-enactments, historical photo archives and production assistance. The project was conceived as a template of how a little town can make an effective, high-production-value historical documentary to tell the story of its own people.
