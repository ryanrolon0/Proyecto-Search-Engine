The French Line

 Texas heiress Mary 'Mame' Carson strikes oil twice in one day, and her wealth scares away her fiance; so she decides to take a boat trip incognito to Paris and snare a husband using only her own abundant natural charms. To this end, she switches identities with model Myrtle Brown, and sets sail with her bosom pal Annie...and French revue star Pierre DuQuesne, who has been hired to keep a watchful eye on "Mary Carson" a perfect setup for Musical Comedy Misunderstandings.
