Small Little Thing

 Set in a bright, catalog-perfect world, "Small Little Thing" follows one trying day in the life of unassuming and meticulous homemaker Jenny, whose life is about to be turned upside-down with the discovery of several small clues which seem to indicate that her husband James is having an affair. Consulting with her drama-obsessed best friend Mary, who insists on relating the suspicious evidence with the overblown plot of her favorite soap opera, does nothing to quell Jenny's growing doubts about her husband. Not one to let her imagination get the better of her, Jenny remains reasonably skeptical. This skepticism soon fades as she finds further clues that Mary might just be right. It is the first in a chain of events that chronicle Jenny's growing paranoia, culminating in a startling revelation that Jenny's little world is far from perfect... in even more ways than it might seem.
