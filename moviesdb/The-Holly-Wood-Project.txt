The Holly Wood Project

 The Holly Wood Project is a bizarre journey through four of the finest movies of 1999. Film student, Holly Wood, enlists the help of legendary film critic Pauline Kael to do battle with Roger Ebert over his inexplicable 'Thumbs Up' review of "The Blair Witch Project." The evil Ebert then seduces Ms. Kael and Holly must rely on the wisdom of Gene Siskel's ghost who helps her secure his old job at the Chicago Tribune. There she finds an old refrigerator that allows her access to Ebert's brain and the opportunity to thwart an inevitable sequel.
