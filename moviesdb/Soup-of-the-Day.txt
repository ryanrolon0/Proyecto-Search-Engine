Soup of the Day

 Brandon Craig is a regular guy who loves split pea soup and happens to be in monogamous relationships with three amazing women editor boss; Wendy, an undercover cop; and Franki, host of the popular Internet show Missleblast. Brandon knows he must eventually choose between them, but when all three women wind up in the same place at the same time to sample Brandon's favorite soup, his love life boils over. Even though there are lots of flavors to choose from - you just can't have 'em all!
