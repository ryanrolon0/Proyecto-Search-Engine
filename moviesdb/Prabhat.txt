Prabhat

 Village belle Sarita falls in love with young and dashing Ramesh, gets married to him, and re-locates to the city. Once in the city, Ramesh takes her to a brothel, and asks her to wait for him for a few days. Unknown to her, Ramesh has sold her to brothel madame, Champabai, for a hefty fee. But Sarita feels that since she is married, she should not engage in any prostitution, and this enrages Champabai and her men, who beat her up severely. Sarita hopes that Ramesh will mend his ways, and come and rescue her and treat her as his lawful wife. But how long will Champabai continue wait for Sarita to come to terms to her situation, before she takes ruthless steps.
