Undocumented, Unafraid

 What happens if you've been brought to the United States as a child, then worked all your life to get good grades, try to get into college and get a good job -- only to be told it's not possible because you're not a citizen? Not only that, if you protest for your right to learn and work, you risk being deported. This is exactly the predicament of three young Chicago Latinos, caught between their dreams for higher education and the crackdown of local government deportations. In the shadow of Arizona's anti-immigrant law SB 1070, UNDOCUMENTED, UNAFRAID follows their fight for equal rights in a city divided over how to treat undocumented immigrants.
