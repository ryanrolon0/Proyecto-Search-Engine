The Price She Paid

 Twelve years ago, Lacey was raped and had a son as a result. Now her rapist is out on parole, and since he's the father of the child and has shown signs of rehabilitation, he's been granted visitation rights by a judge. Slowly but predictably, Lacey realizes things just aren't right with him, but thanks to her rapists manipulation, everybody she knows, from her boss to her friends, dismisses her feelings and thinks she's crazy. Meanwhile, her attacker is primed to finish what he started 12 years ago.
