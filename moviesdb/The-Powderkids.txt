The Powderkids

 Lucas, who dreams of becoming a writer, loses his scholarship after three years of college for poor grades. Lucas begs his English professor for an extra credit assignment to bring his GPA up and to re-instate his scholarship. Lucas is granted an extra credit assignment and decides he must return home during a school break to complete his assignment. It's Lucas' return that reunites him with high-school friends, his strained and somewhat distant relationship with his mother and the story and inspiration that he's been searching for. Lucas is quickly embraced by those he knew best in high school and is invited into their lifestyle of girls, cars, clubs and drugs. After his initial run in with his friends, Lucas realizes that it won't be easy to write the tale without living the life. With twists & turns, love & drama, the writings become an experience and the experience becomes the story of the Powderkids.
