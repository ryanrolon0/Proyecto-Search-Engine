The Monster Man

 It's the year 2210 and the world has been wiped out by a virus let loose on mankind by an alien race that wants to take over. Before they can do so, they find that two humans have survived the virus, a man and a woman. The gluttonous leader Lord Gideon dispatches his army of inept alien ninjas to finish them off so they can claim earth all for their own.
