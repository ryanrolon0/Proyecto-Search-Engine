Vijeta

 Advocate Durga Prasad was to have received a file from Chote Thakur with regard to a case pending in a Court in Bangalore, India. However, Chote gets killed, he does not receive the file and the Court's decision goes against him. Then he is approached by a former Government Employee, an Inquiry Officer, who claims that he was wrongly dismissed and framed by corrupt Government Officials. Durga Prasad, along with his juniors, Ashok, Ravi and one other, decide to handle his case, however, before even the case could be filed, the Inquiry Officer is killed. An angered Durga is determined to take this matter to Court, but before that could happen, he and his wife, Laxmi, are killed in broad daylight right outside the Courthouse. His Junior, Ashok, promises to avenge their killings and sets about to locate their killers. He finds out that all of them work for Vidhya Sagar, and he goes about killing them one by one. Then the DIG of Police, Jagdish Chaudhary, assigns Police Inspector Vijayalaxmi to apprehend Ashok, not knowing that Vijaya and Ashok are in love with each other. She questions Ashok, but he provides her an alibi for each and every occurrence. But when the Mayor of Bangalore is killed, she catches Ashok red-handed, leaving open the question whether Ashok will be ready to provide an alibi for this death or merely claim that he did not do it. The question remains, if Ashok did not kill the Mayor, then who did?
