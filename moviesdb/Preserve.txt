Preserve

 A young undertaker works on bodies to make them visually acceptable for open casket funerals. From his basement work shop he can see the feet of the young lady (Barbara) who is secretly loves. She runs a local barber shop where he gets a shave. When Barbara's lover drowns his body comes to the undertaker where the undertaker can see her image embedded in his eye ball as he died. He wants her to look at him like she looked at her drowned partner and sets out to get his love returned forever.
