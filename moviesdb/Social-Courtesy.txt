Social Courtesy

 Bill Brett has been invited to a costume party at Martha's house, to which he will be taking Carol. But Bill doesn't seem too happy about any of it because he doesn't know how to act properly around people. The off screen narrator acts as Bill's guide through this evening, giving him tips on the way he should act and why. Bill is given multiple opportunities to get each situation right, these situations which include picking Carol up at her house, greeting Martha's mother, and meeting strangers at the party. Bill learns that when he acts courteously in these social situations, people in turn will act courteously to him which results in him and them being happier. Teenagers Bill and Carol are invited to a party. Bill, who is being his usual rude and obnoxious self, is suddenly "transported" out of the party and shown by the narrator that it is much more productive for him to be friendly and courteous to people than it is to be bad-tempered, nasty creep he usually is.
