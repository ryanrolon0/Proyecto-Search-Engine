The Evil Dead

 Five friends (Ash, Cheryl, Scotty, Shelly and Linda) All decide to spend a nice, quiet weekend at a cabin out in the woods. When they get there, they discover a book made out of flesh and inked in blood. They also find a tape recorder, with a strange man's voice on it. When they play the tape, it begins with the man translating what is written in the strange book. The translation awakens evil demons which have been resting in the woods, and now, they are ready to attack the people that have awakened them from their slumber.
