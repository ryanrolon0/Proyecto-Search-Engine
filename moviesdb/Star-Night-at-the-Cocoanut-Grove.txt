Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove

 Hollywood's famous Cocoanut Grove nightclub stages a Star Night-only musical revue in which many Hollywood actors attend. Staged is the operative word. Entertainers include Ted Fio Roit and his orchestra, Eduardo Durant's Tango Band, and the Fancho & Marco Sunkist Beauties. Leo Carrillo acted as the Master of Ceremonies, and introduces a galaxy of stars from their tables. Those higher on the 1935 pecking order, Mary Pickford, Jack Oakie, Arline Judge, Bing Crosby and Gary Cooper, come to the microphone and do a bit...mostly chit-chatting bits.
