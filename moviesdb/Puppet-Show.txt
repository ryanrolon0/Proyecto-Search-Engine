Puppet Show

 The Netherlands is a civilized country. Differences are settled in a civilized manner. Crime is battled with integrity by an independent, competent police force in an incorruptable justice system. Right? Forget it! Puppet Show introduces the ugly truth extortion acceptable; prejudiced, incompetent police officials who lead investigations they do not understand; a prosecutor who manipulates the US Justice department into kidnapping. lies to to and about Canadian officials, withholds evidence, and falsifies extradition requests; and judges who give it all their blessing. Welcome to justice Netherlands style!
