The Depression of Detective Downs

 Detective Rolando Downs is having one of the toughest weeks of his life. His partner is in the hospital, his car is close to breaking down, and he has to solve a kidnapping case so a little girl can live to see her next birthday. All of this wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't also struggling with a bad case of depression.
