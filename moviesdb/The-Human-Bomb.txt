The Human Bomb

 A cameraman is covering police court when a burly, wild-eyed man demands to see the Chief and tells the latter that he demands $200,000 from the president of a street-car company. The demand is backed by the stranger carrying an intricate wired-box charged with dynamite which will explode when the fingers of the demanding stranger release a button, in which event that section of the town will be blown to bits. The Chief devise many intricate plans to divert the disaster, but all are impractical. But the cameraman also has a plan.
