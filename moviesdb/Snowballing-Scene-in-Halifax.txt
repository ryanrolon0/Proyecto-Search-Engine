Snowballing Scene in Halifax

 Shows about 300 small boys in front of the armory engaged in a lively snowball fight. A teamster passes down the road. The boys immediately turn their attention to him and pelt him with snowballs, knock off his hat and disable him generally. This is a very humorous picture.
