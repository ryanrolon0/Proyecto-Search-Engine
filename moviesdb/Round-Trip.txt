Round Trip

 Yusuke arrives in Miami from Tokyo to search for his missing sister Michiko, who came to visit a friend but overstayed her visa to start a new life in a city of exiles. With the help of a private eye he learns of his sister's Miami life, the Tokyo disillusionment that drove her from home. Yusuke never really knew Michiko, just as she never really knew herself. Did Michiko determine her own fate? Can he determine his own?
