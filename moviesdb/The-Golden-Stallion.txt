The Golden Stallion

 Diamonds are being smuggled across the border from Mexico in a specially made shoe of a palomino mare. One of the smugglers is killed when the mare runs off. The sheriff blames Trigger for the death. To keep his horse from being destroyed, Roy confesses and goes to jail. The smugglers buy Trigger and put him to work smuggling diamonds. The mare, who had earlier heard a trist with Trigger, foals Trigger, Jr. who Roy, finally out of jail, uses to help capture the smugglers. Horse dealer Roy Rogers has a contact to supply horses for a rodeo company. He has his eye on a herd of wild horses, led by a golden stallion, that he can capture and train. But a diamond-smuggling gang has a special-made shoe, on a tame horse that runs with the herd, and hide the diamonds in that shoe as the herd can cross the Mexican border with no problems. When they hear that Roy plans to capture the herd, they scheme to get rid of him. For personal reasons, Roy confesses to a crime he did not commit and is sentenced to a road gang.
