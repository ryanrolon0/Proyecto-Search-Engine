Raja Jani

 Rajmata's grand-daughter, Ratna, has been missing since the age of 12. Ten years later she still has her people looking for her, and celebrates her birthday every year. Rajkumar Singh and Diwan Gajendra Singh conspire to hoodwink the Rajmata by getting a street dancer, Shanoo, to take her place - with considerable success. Rajmata is delighted to have her darling back with her, and prepares to hand over the crown as well as the keys to a vast treasure to her. She does not know that she is trusting an impostor, who will soon be turning her newly acquired treasure over to Rajkumar and the Diwan, and at the same time marry Rajmata's nephew, Pratap Bahadur.
