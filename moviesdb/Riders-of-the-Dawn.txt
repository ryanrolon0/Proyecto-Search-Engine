Riders of the Dawn

 Jimmy Wakely and Dusty, traveling with the medicine show owned by "Lasses" White, stop at the Ferguson ranch and find the rancher and his wife killed. They take the Ferguson baby to their camp, where outlaws Joe, Slick and Pete attempt to kidnap the baby, while Dusty is reporting the murders to Sheriff Beasley and town mayor Melinda Pringle. Wakely and his singers hide the baby from its legal guardian, Doc Judd Thomas, as they suspect him of being connected with the Ferguson murders. When Melinda and her niece, Penny, discover where the baby is, Jimmy enlists their aid. The sheriff discovers that Melinda has the baby and jails her, Jimmy and Dusty. Using his medicine show troupe as a diversion, "Lasses" breaks them out of jail. They search the doctor's office and find that he had the family killed after he discovered oil on their property, and is waiting to get custody of the baby so he can sign valuable contracts with an oil company.
