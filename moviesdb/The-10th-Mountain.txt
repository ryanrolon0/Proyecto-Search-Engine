The 10th Mountain

 At the peak of World War II, an elite squad from the 10th Mountain division receives a new squad leader, a Filipino. The squad's mixed views on their new Captain are tested as new orders have them infiltrating a German base in Northern Italy. Rising tempers and dissension in the ranks bring the squad to the brink of mutiny until a battle breaks out and every man's resolve is put to the test.
