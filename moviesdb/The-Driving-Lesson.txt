The Driving Lesson

 This is a story about two Korean guys in different generations in the U.S. Forced to bear each others company as a driving teacher and student, they find it difficult to understand each other at first. An extended road trip, however, gives them a chance to get a glimpse at their mutual loneliness and make unexpected connections.
