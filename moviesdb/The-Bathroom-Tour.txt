The Bathroom Tour

 On May 1st, 2006, Noah, Alex, and Jen officially revived The Best Thing Ever moniker before embarking on The Bathroom Tour. For twelve straight days, The Best Thing Ever invaded bathrooms across New England to perform their music for unsuspecting audiences. Though the band was often met with resistance, the tour was meant to be enjoyable for the audience, and was considered a great success.
