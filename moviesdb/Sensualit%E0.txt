Sensualità

 The shortned USA running time for "Sensualita", (which, by the way, was not financed nor produced by Paramount Pictures, although some source seems to think so) is because most of the sweating-in-the-stables and toil-in-the-soil love-making is largely missing from the film but retained in the ads and posters. Refugee Franca Gabre (Eleanora Rossi Drago)comes to the Po Valley with intent to use her obvious attributes and man-swaying talents to gain some security. A gals gotta do what a gal's gotta do. She targets farm-owning brothers Riccardo (Amedo Nazzari) and Carlo Sartori (Marcello Mastroiani)and uses the latter in an attempt to reach Riccardo, the older brother. He resists all of her seductive ways---including her walk copied from Marilyn Monroe---and she runs off with Carlo. Riccardo follows and finds out they are married. Now, he gets interested. Somebody has to die.
