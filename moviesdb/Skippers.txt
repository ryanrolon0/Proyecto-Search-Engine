Skippers

 After a particularly horrible start to Reggie's morning where everything that can go wrong does go wrong....he finds it only gets worse once he's at school. So Reggie and his best friend Renton decide to skip classes that day and hang out at the mall. From there it's a madcap series of mishaps involving life, love, and masturbation.
