Sûpâ Mario korekushon

 Four of the greatest Super Mario Bros. games of all time come together in this one cartridge for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Super Mario 1, Lost Levels, Super Mario 2, and Super Mario 3. Lost Levels was originally Super Mario 2 and released in Japan only because Japanese game players like challenging games. So it is now available in America for the first time ever. All the graphics and characters have been redone, some given new moves and new looks and different colors like the white squid that attacks you under the water in Mario 1 is now pink, and in Mario 1 when reaching the end of the castle, instead of one Mushroom man waiting for you, the same number of the level is the same number of Mushroom people waiting for you. There's more surprises awaiting you in the other games as well.
