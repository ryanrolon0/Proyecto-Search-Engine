Red Dawn

 It is the mid-1980s. From out of the sky, Soviet & Cuban troops begin landing on the football field of a Colorado high school. In seconds, the paratroops have attacked the school & sent a group of teenagers fleeing into the mountains. Armed only with hunting rifles, pistols & bows and arrows, the teens struggles to survive the bitter winter & Soviet KGB patrols hunting for them. Eventually trouble arises when they kill a group of Soviet soldiers on patrol in the highlands. Soon, they will wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops....under the banner of 'Wolverines'! At the outbreak of World War III, midwestern high school students turned refugees slowly organized themself into an effective guerilla force to turn back the tide of Soviet invaders. A film depicting the invasion of the United States from the north and south by communist forces from Cuba and Russia in the beginning of WWIII and the efforts of partisans from a small mid-western town to turn back the invasion. This film is one of the basis of the beliefs of the citizens militias and patriot groups about the possiblity of a U.N. takeover of the U.S. The movie and the theory of the New World Order proposed by the militias are similar, invasion by a foreign force, a big gun grab, arrest of gun owners, military equipment being moved on railroads, enemy helicopters re-education facilities (concentration camps), and a citizen force that strikes back. A group of high school students become guerrilla fighters when their town is invaded by Central American and eventually Soviet soldiers at the beginning of WWIII in this apocalyptic fantasy. The pressures of their desperate existence begin to wear away at the "Wolverine's" unity as the Soviet bloc forces hunt them down.
