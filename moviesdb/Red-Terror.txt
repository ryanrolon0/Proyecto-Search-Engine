Red Terror

 Red Terror tells the story of an Ethiopian family in the 1975 revolution. During the time of the Red Terror the Ethiopian army forced every first born male to join the battle against the rebellious liberation front. Scared of the ruthless dictatorship Mahari sends his son Alemu away to hide from the military forces. But when the army arrives and finds the son gone, they take Mahari instead; leaving behind his wife and his younger son Tatek. Knowing his father would be tortured and unable to bear this burden, Alemu trades himself for his father and joins the army while Mahari escapes reunites with his family. In a twist of fate the army returns to the village presenting the dead body of Alemu to the villagers, to make clear how they handle disobedience. This leaves Mahari with a tough decision to make.
