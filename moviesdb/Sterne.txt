Sterne

 Stationed in a Bulgarian village in 1943, Walter, an artist and corporal in the Wehrmacht, lives an almost idyllic life far away from the war. Then, a transit camp is set up for Jews arriving from Greece and awaiting transport to Auschwitz. A detachment of Nazi soldiers escorting Greek Jews to the Auschwitz death camp stops at a small Bulgarian town in 1943. Walter, the non-commissioned officer from the Nazi army, a skeptical and disillusioned intellectual, falls most unexpectedly (even for himself) in love with the Jewish girl Ruth. This new feeling gradually makes him stop and reflect on the events taking place around him and comes face to face with the inhuman nature of fascism. He is tortured by anxious thought about the part he is called to play in the eternal struggle between evil and good. Helped by Bulgarian resistance fighters, Walter organizes Ruth's escape. When the time arrives he realizes that he has been deceived about the exact departure hour of the prisoners.
