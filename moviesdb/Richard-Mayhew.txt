Richard Mayhew

 Richard Mayhew paints landscapes. These images have taken root within the the artist's inner spirit and are expressed through oil paint on canvas and watercolor on paper. The landscapes never depict a specific place, but capture a poetic feeling about the land. Are they abstracts? Are they impressions? Are they expressions? Are they landscapes? Only you the viewer, in concert with the artist, can say for sure.
