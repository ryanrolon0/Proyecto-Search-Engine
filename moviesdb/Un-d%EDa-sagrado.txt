Un día sagrado

 Having a discussion after a night of revelry, "Moustache" Flores, a corrupt loan shark, accidentally kills Sanhueza, his partner and friend. In despair, he turns to "Gypsy", a lout who carries out dirty works, who in turn asks "Tomb" Gonzalez to help him to erase all of the evidence and make the body disappear. Things get complicated and all of them come up against more than one surprise.
