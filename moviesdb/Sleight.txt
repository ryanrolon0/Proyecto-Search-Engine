Sleight

 After being inspired and challenged by a magician's illusion, a con-artist decides to implement the very same elusive principles of prestidigitator's hand in order to pull and create one of the most elaborate and seamless heist of his life. Ina game of chess with people as the pieces, this intense game of 'who's who' leads up to an unraveling mystery of persons, trust and mistaken identity, all while culminating into a high paced chase toward its final monumental, and surprisingly revealing end.
