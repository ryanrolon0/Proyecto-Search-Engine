Voodoo

 Some marriages are cursed from the start - a fact Mr. Decker knows all too well. When his wife returns from her travels abroad and provokes yet another fight, the couple turn to an unusual solution. 'Voodoo' is narrated by Colm Feore and stars David Nykl and Camille Sullivan. Set in 1944 and shot on black and white film, this dark and witty clash of the unhappily married Deckers captures a style and humor reminiscent of the very era it is set in.
