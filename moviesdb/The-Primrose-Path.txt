The Primrose Path

 A sweet young Miss, from a proper upbringing that did not include any parental discussions on the ways of the birds-and-bees, is swept off her feet by the school's football hero, and they spend some time parked in his jalopy at Lover's Lane. The football player is scoring touchdowns on a different playing field (with no goal lines), while Miss Sweet is soon missing important calendar dates.
