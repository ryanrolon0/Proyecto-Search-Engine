The Day Mary Pickford Fell off the Screen

 Mary Pickford has just fallen off the screen and, dumbfounded wanders through the streets of a major city. Everything is so different from her time. The city is too loud. The people are too busy. She only needs someone to show her the way back to the movies, the silent ones. Terrified in this unknown reality, Mary Pickford finds comfort in an isolated park. Wait a minute, she's not alone anymore, somebody else has also fallen off the screen.
