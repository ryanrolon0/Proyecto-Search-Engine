Roseland

 Helen is a taxi dancer at Roseland, a Manhattan club. That night she plans to enter a singing contest Roseland is hosting on the radio. Her dad, a servant at a household where her boyfriend is the chauffeur, has been ill, so she stops by to see him where he works. While there, she sits with her beau in the back seat of the town car and drops her Roseland ID card, which Donn Cook, the heir to the family fortune, finds on his way to town for the evening. He goes slumming at the Roseland to return the ID. He likes Helen at first sight, setting up a choice Helen may have to make between the wealthy Cook and the chauffeur. With that choice on her mind, she enters the contest.
