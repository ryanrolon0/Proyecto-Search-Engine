Swing High

 The Codonas are a family of trapeze artists on their fourth generation in the business. 'Lalo Codona' (qv) is the catcher, 'Alfredo Codona' (qv) and 'Vera Codona' (qv) being those that fly through the air. The Codonas are seen performing and practicing under the watchful eye of their father, 'Edward Codona' (qv), once a trapeze artist himself. Trapeze is a skill that requires strength, agility and good timing. The Codonas possess all three. Alfredo's most crowd pleasing tricks include a double somersault while blindfolded, and a triple somersault, he being the only person alive that now masters the latter.
