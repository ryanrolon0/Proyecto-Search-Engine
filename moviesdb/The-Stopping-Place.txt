The Stopping Place

 A newly retired man and his wife move to a small Texas town to head a ministry for displaced community residents called THE STOPPING PLACE. What starts out as one man's calling to help others, turns into a disaster; testing his marriage and faith until he acknowledges God sometimes works outside in for His purpose to be known.
