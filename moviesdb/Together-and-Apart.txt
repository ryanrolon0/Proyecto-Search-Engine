Together and Apart

 Tom comes to Toronto for a reading of his poetry. Tom's ex-lover Michael lives in Toronto but is now married. At Micheal's home, over dinner, surrounded by Michael's wife and dinner guests, the two men sing their secret thoughts to one another while the others continue to eat unawares.
