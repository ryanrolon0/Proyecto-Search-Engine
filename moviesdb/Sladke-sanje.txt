Sladke sanje

 Egon Vittori (Janko Mandic) is thirteen years old and does not have a record player. It is the beginning of the seventies and Yugoslavia seems to be the land of prosperity. Goods are being imported from the West, and these include American music, films and fashion. Everybody but Egon owns a record player. Finding his path among his family members, hippie owners of music records, schoolmates, teachers, communists and dissidents. Egon gets his record player in the end. And grows up somewhere along the way.
