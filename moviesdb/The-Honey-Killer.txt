The Honey Killer

 THE HONEY KILLER is about 24 hours in the life of Hedge-fund manager, Darryl Maddock, who suddenly wakes up to the fact that his stunning and beautiful fiancE is a serial gold-digger with an extravagant penchant for violence. An original British, black comedy that is unlike any other film to come out of the UK this year.
