Soldiers in White

 A young intern is drafted and placed in the Army Medical Corps as a buck private and is none too happy about it. Injured he is placed in the hospital and a Major comes by and explains how army doctors make important advances in medical science. The private is inspired and promises to make a good soldier. He is even more inspired when a nurse becomes his superior officer.
