Tifanfaya

 Scrawny, awkward, unlucky Tifanfaya gets a queer start to her life as a orphan. Uncle Brutus and aunt Mathilde agree to look after her, but for devious reasons for her very own. But clumsy Tifanfaya becomes Queen of the Mountain Bandits and with her gang she rebels against her wicked stepmother and wins back her castle and her country.
