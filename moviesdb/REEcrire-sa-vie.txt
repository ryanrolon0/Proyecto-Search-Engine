REEcrire sa vie

 With no education, what kind of life will you have? Will you be able to understand all the government paperwork? Will you be able to hide the fact that you can't write or read? Will you be able to do the job that you want? The solution is maybe closer then you think... Seven (7) people give us the reasons they dropped out originally and what brought them back to school after all those years. Seven (7) people with different life styles and backgrounds, seven (7) people who found out that the only way to touch their dreams is by Rewriting their life ("REEcrire sa vie").
