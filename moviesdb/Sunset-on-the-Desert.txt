Sunset on the Desert

 Roy is mistaken for a bad guy expected by the local outlaw gang. He goes undercover to pin the goods on the bad guys. Just as he is about to do so, the real bad guy shows up. Songs include "Remember Me," "Yip Pe Yi Your Troubles Away," "Faithful Pal of Mine," and "Don Juan." Judge Kirby is being blackmailed and forced to let outlaws go free. He was once the partner of Roy's father and when Roy reads in the paper that he is in trouble he heads out to help him. Arriving, Roy quickly realizes he has been mistaken for one of the outlaws and is not wanted in town. However he stays, and now posing as that outlaw, hopes to learn who is causing all the problems.
