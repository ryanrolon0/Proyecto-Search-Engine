The Investigation

 This TV drama tells the true story of a bungled and obstructed police manhunt for a serial killer who could and should have been imprisoned after his first crime. Two young RCMP officers, each seperately investigating a rape and murder, cuptured the culprit, but because of legal red tape, jurisdictional chaos and incompetence, the suspect was allowed to continue his rampage until he was finally arrested and imprisoned - several murders later. Local RCMP (Mounties) cop Darryll Kettles (Fraser Valley) realizes in May 1981 that Olden, the rapist suspect he accidentally arrested had probably gotten away with both serial rape and a series of murders all over the Canadian province of British Columbia. Darryll is forced, by the brass, to leave to matter to the Serious Crimes unit and forbidden to participate actively later. At HQ corporal Les Forsythe proves he's both dedicated and able at working the brass for resources, but the case still gets bogged up in internal budget and jurisdictional absurdities for years. When Superintendent Bruce Northorp finally forms a top priority task force, he takes charge while Forsythe faces accusations of fatal procedural errors and Kettles's frustration has become unbearable. Olsen thrives, and even now gets an absurd opportunity.
