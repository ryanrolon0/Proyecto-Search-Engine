There's No Fish Food in Heaven

 Black comedy about an obsessive street graffiti artist, who falls obsessively in love with a frustrated artist he meets. Unfortunately, rather than trying to meet with her in a conventional way, he decides to mail himself to her with the help of a pet shop owner. Unfortunately, when he arrives, she is with another man, who immediately makes love to her against the box. Then when they decide to open the box, they stab scissors into the box, killing the man. The action then follows that the spirit of the graffiti artist can now communicate only with the artist and, fearfully, she decides she has to get rid of the body.
