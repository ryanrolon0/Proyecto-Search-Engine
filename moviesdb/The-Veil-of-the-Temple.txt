The Veil of the Temple

 Sir John Tavener's magnum opus "The Veil of the Temple" and the setting of the Temple Church, London combines Western music with the insights and intensity of the Orthodox East. Sir John has written this gothic masterpiece for those of any faith or those of none. He says,"It is a journey towards God, and if you see God as the centre, as you must, then it is a journey from the periphery to God". Divided into eight cycles, each ascending in pitch, cycles one through seven draw from the versus of St. John's Gospel at the centre, and concluding with the eighth cycle, belonging to the day of eternity, which is finially 'paradisal'- a musical image of the celestial Temple within.
