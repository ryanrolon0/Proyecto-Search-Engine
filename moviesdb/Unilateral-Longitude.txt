Unilateral Longitude

 Gina, Sue, Denise and Kate are four wine loving, man hungry, tobacco devouring women of the world. Only thing is, they never get further than the local wine bar in their beloved Nottingham. Every week they drink, get drunk and talk about sex, men, sex and men. This particular night however, they start to use a few home truths to snap each other out of the reverie and a game of truth or dare becomes a night long expose of the brittle bond they all share.
