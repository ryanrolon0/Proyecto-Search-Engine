The Sin Unatoned

 Bob, a professional gambler, quits that profession when he gets married. One night a man comes to his house, and Bob recognizes the man as an acquaintance from back in his gambling days. Bob gives him some money so the man won't tell his wife. The man agrees, but when he gets a look at the beautiful girl that Bob has married, he gets other ideas.
