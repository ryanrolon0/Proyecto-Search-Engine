The Screwdriver

 Woody Woodpecker is driving through the countryside and is, shall we say, not a stickler for the rules. He's practically asking for trouble when he confronts a traffic cop who explains he is looking for speeders. Woody reveals himself to be a speeder by driving to Alaska and back in less than a minute. The cop tries to arrest him but Woody states, "I bet ya wouldn't be so tough without that uniform." The officer undresses but Woody attacks him with a boxing glove camera. Woody also gets his goat by dressing as a farmer on horse-and-buggy and as a Chinaboy with rickshaw. Finally, the cop flips out and is sent to a mental hospital with Woody as his caretaker. Woody Woodpecker is exactly the kind of guy you don't want on the road, not anywhere within miles of you. He's not ashamed of his bad driving. In fact, he sings a song bragging that he's the bane of coppers. He soon proves to be the bane of one particular copper motorcycle cop, who will quickly go mad trying to chase down Woody, who has the wherewithal to disguise himself as an old buggy driver, a rickshaw driver, a cute little baby and even, at last, the poor cop's doctor in the "jerk ward."
