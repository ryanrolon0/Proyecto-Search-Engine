Trouble in High Timber Country

 The Yeagers own a mining and timber company. Now they are careful not to overdue it, so that the business can continue for a long time. And officially their company has no union cause they believe that they are fair to their workers, but a few of their people don't see it that way. When a corporation, whose intention is to strip the business and leave hundreds of workers out of work, makes an offer to buy their business, Carroll Yeager the patriarch rejects the offer. So they instruct a union rep to organize one and institute a strike. Which happens, the Yeagers are left all alone to try and fill their orders, cause they have a mortgage that's due, and they are unwilling to concede.
