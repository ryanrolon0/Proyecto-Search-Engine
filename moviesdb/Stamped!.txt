Stamped!

 Stamped! is a hilarious and dramatic story set in modern-day high school. As students make-up a Saturday state mandated test, teenage misfit Mitchell psychoanalyzes and takes apart Tori, a haughty socialite, Cody, a blockhead jock, DeShawn, a smart homeboy, and Vanessa, a quiet Latina. After torturing them about their roles in life, Mitchell introduces them to his world. They escape from the testing library, find out each other's deep dark secrets, and play practical jokes on a nerdy administrator Mr. Kimmer. During this time, they break down the social barriers and stereotypes that high school has "stamped" them with.
