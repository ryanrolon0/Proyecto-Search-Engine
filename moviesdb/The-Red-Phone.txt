The Red Phone

 When the red phone rings, the AT 2000 goes into action. Covertly created and financed by an international consortium of governments and wide-ranging private interests, AT 2000 represents the last line of defense against worldwide terrorism. A secured hi-tech computer line, the red phone accesses only terrorist activity already investigated and verified by - but beyond the grasp of - any one of a number of international police, special security, and military agencies, so its urgent signal raises the alarm on a clear and present danger - an explosive situation that only AT 2000 can defuse. Headed by Quentin Forbes, the group is assembled from special units throughout the entire commonwealth of nations - the men and woman of AT 2000 are the very best in their respective specialities. But they are also renegades, marching to a different drumbeat of justice, one above and beyond the call of "regular duty". Forming what is, essentially, the first truly international police force, they employ wide ranging (although officially hidden) powers springing from a simple mandate - to track down, combat and defeat terrorism in all its ugly faces. The heart of this new dramatic series lies in the life or death cases of AT 2000, most of them taken from actual case files. Its soul lives in its colorful and disparate characters - their public and private triumphs, failures, heartbreaks, joys and everything inbetween.
