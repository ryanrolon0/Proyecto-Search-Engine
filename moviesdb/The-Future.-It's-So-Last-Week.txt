The Future. It's So Last Week

 Set in the near future, amid global climate devastation, this film tells the story of the Outlanders. They are a female group of AWOL soldiers and outlaw civilians who form an uneasy alliance to determine the fate of earth's remaining humans. Having resisted relocation to bio-spheres they live illegally in the wastelands of the old cities where life is harsh and all but unlivable. Insubordination, exhaustion, lust, boredom and distrust color and drive their relationships. The Outlanders have two options, stop the relocation of humans to another planet or send a message back time warning the past to save the future.
