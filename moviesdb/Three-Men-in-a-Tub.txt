Three Men in a Tub

 When Darla shows up with a new beau, Alfalfa is bereft. Unable to compete with Waldo's wealth, he decides to compete with skill. Waldo has a miniature speedboat. Alfalfa and the gang build their own "speedboat," powered by ducks, and challenge Waldo to a race for the hand of Darla.
