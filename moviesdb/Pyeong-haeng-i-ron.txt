Pyeong-haeng-i-ron

 KIM Suk-hyun is Korea's youngest appointed criminal court head judge, very famous for his rational rulings. It is before his court that the case of distinguished mathematics professor SOHN Ki-chul's murder of his wife is presented. While examining SOHN's file, Suk-hyun finds SOHN's life unbelievably parallels Kurt Gödel's. But KIM believes fate is what one makes of it, and just regards SOHN as a crazy old professor who killed his wife. One day, Suk-hyun gets a strange phone call threatening the lives of his wife, Yoon-kyung, and his young daughter. Before long, Yoon-kyung turns up dead, and SOHN dies of starvation-just like Gödel.
