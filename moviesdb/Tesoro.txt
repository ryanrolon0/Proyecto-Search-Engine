Tesoro

 Ana Ramirez is a child barren poor woman living in Mexico. Desperate to secure money for her father's life-saving operation, she agrees to accompany Ciro across the US border to deliver a "package." At a Texas motel, Ana meets Michael, a lonely orphaned Black boy hungry for her attention. Spiraling into desperation to return to her sick father, all of Ana's attempts to return are foiled by the boy Michael, who steals her resources in an effort to survive, leaving her at odds with the boy. Despite an English-Spanish language barrier, it is only when Ana and Michael join forces do they realize how much they need each other. The stakes are then raised when Ciro, Ana and Michael find themselves in the deadly path of Domingo and his dangerous drug cartel's search for the stolen TESORO diamond. Will Ana make it back to Mexico alive?
