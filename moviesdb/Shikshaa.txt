Shikshaa

 Vijay Gupta lives a wealthy lifestyle in Bombay along with his businessman dad, Dwarkadas, and housewife mom, Laxmi. He is used to a comfortable, irresponsible and extravagant lifestyle much to his dad's displeasure. When Vijay gets their family car in an accident, his dad forbids him to drive again, but his mom buys him another car. Vijay accepts a challenge from his friend, Harishchandra, and both race their respective vehicles from Bombay to Lonavla. On the way back, Vijay runs over two men, Raghunath and his brother, Kishen, fails to stop, and returns home. Raghunath passes away, Kishen loses his vision due to a retinal detachment, and subsequently the Police arrive at the Gupta residence to arrest Vijay, but their servant, Kundan, accepts responsibility, is arrested, tried in Court, and imprisoned. Dwarkadas is very upset, arguments ensue, Vijay leaves the house, but his mother locates him and gives him her Cheque book. They had planned their son's marriage with Madhu, who lives a wealthy lifestyle on a farm in Khandala along with her dad, Kamal, but now must inform Kamal that Vijay has run away, and may never return home. The question remains where is Vijay and what lesson has he learned from his past experiences?
