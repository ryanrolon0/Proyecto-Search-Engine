Scene of the Crime

 Homicide detective Mike Conovan investigates the shooting of fellow detective Monigan...who apparrently was moonlighting as guard for a bookie. He finds that all the bookies in town are being robbed, most upsetting to the racket bosses who can't get normal police protection. Mike encounters blind alleys and double crosses, and is distracted by his wife's growing disenchantment. Lots of police slang. Police Detective Mike Conovan, for personal and professional reasons, sets out to solve the murder of a fellow-detective, in whose pockets are found thousand-dollar bills. He has only two slim clues but those lead to a fixer and a bookmaker, and the striptease-dancer girlfriend of the bookmaker. The latter, along with Conovan's wife, who wants him off the case as she fears for his safety, cause Conovan some trials and tribulations while he is trying to find the killer.
