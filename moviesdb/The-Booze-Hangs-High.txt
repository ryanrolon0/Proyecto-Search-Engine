The Booze Hangs High

 Bosko is having a grand time on the farm. He dances with a cow and laughs when the cow's "pants" fall down, revealing polka-dotted underwear. He plays a horse's tail like a violin. The horse enjoys the music and dances to it eccentrically, even making like an ice skater at one point. Three ducklings and their mother enjoy the music, too, and dance along. Bosko feeds his pigs by dumping a trash can into their trough. The two baby pigs find a bottle of booze in the trough. They and their father all get drunk on it. The father accidentally flings the bottle away from himself, and it breaks against Bosko's head. Bosko, soaked in booze, is now drunk, too.
