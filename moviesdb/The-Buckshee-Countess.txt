The Buckshee Countess

 A bankrupt Countess, broods amid the isolation of her decaying Estate, her only companion, a mute butler. She is consumed with an obsession for her former glories and the servants she can no longer afford. Her deranged power fixation compels her to abduct her visitors, starting with Beth, a consultant for an employment agency and including a pizza delivery lady, a charity worker and a policeman. They're all set to work at domestic chores, beaten, locked in a cell and fed stale porridge, all overseen by the Butler who gradually falls for Beth. Ordered to murder and bury Beth, The Butler has to make a dangerous choice.
