The Pet

 The story follows a young woman who, in an emotional and financial crisis, succumbs to the charm of an aristocratic benefactor. Their relationship develops from her desire to be loved and cared for and his desire to overcome the loss of his beloved setter, a loyal and devoted pet. She agrees for a considerable sum of money to become his human pet, to sleep in a cage, never wear clothes, and to be led on a leash for a period of six-months. His desire to showcase his beautiful new pet and to have her market value appraised prompts him to place her on the GSM [Global Slave Market]. His arrogance and wealth together are no match for the power and ruthlessness of 21st century slave traders. This exploration of power, trust and captivity were inspired by the prevalence of more-or-less consensual slave/master related lifestyles as well as the existence of global systemic servitude that allows for cheap labor, sex slaves, organ sales etc. There are 11 companies in the US and the UK that makes human pet cages, human auctions where the purchaser can completes the transaction through "Pay Pal", can be found throughout the Internet and slave marking listings such as branding, piercing, tagging and what insiders refer to as TPE [Total Power Exchange] for consensual slaves number in the thousands on the Internet. The GSM is modeled upon and functions much the same way as the NYSE or NASDAQ but without the pretense of regulation and with humans as commodities.
