Telling Amy's Story

 'Somebody call 911. I just shot Amy' - Amy's husband Vince, just after he stepped out his front door. Words he said calmly to Amy's parents and young children as they sat in the driveway waiting. The police arrived, finding Amy in the living room, a bag containing bottles, diapers and onesies lying beside her dead body. Lost of people knew - but only small bits and pieces. Her husband was a 'jerk.' He hassled her co-workers. He always carried a gun, and he'd threatened her with death before. Her murder was inevitable, but wasn't apparent to anyone. Told by an impassioned police detective together with the courts, Amy's friends, and her family, 'Telling Amy's Story' creates a disturbing, and exasperating picture of a life that was.
