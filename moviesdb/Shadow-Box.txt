Shadow Box

 This film is The Accused meets Fried Green Tomatoes, with characters just as exciting that you'll want to both cry and cheer for. Their story is one of humanity and humility, that we can all relate to and understand as life deals its blows, but in the end, strength prevails in victory over the darkest depths of despair.
