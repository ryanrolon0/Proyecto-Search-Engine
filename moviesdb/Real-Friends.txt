Real Friends

 Paul and John had Yoko. Felix and Leroy have Coco. Meet Felix. Ordinary guy, ordinary life. But his best friend, Leroy, is anything but ordinary, he's imaginary. Felix and Leroy did everything together, that is, until Leroy got a girlfriend. A real, human girlfriend. Leroy packed up out of their apartment leaving Felix feeling lost and depressed. Felix tried, but fails miserably, to find the cure for this loneliness, but nothing seems to work. However, just when Felix thinks he can take no more of this cruel hand fate has dealt, Leroy and his girlfriend break up and he wants to move back in. Things are finally looking up for Felix, yet fate has an ace the size of a bus up its sleeve, and its speeding right towards Leroy.
