The Massive

 Tanner Hall and The Massive crew are on the shred mission. Follow the action from Copper Mountain, CO to Retallack BC. Salt Lake City, UT to St Anton Austria. Pemberton BC to the far frontier of Haines Alaska. And bring it all home with an end of the year jam at Mt Hood Oregon. This is The Massive.
