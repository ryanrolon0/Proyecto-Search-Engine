Rire et châtiment

 Vincent RomEro is an osteopath who makes a point of being funny every minute he is awake. In fact it is his way to remain the center of attention. His antics wind up irritating his wife Camille, a geriatric doctor, to such an extent that she leaves him one day. At first Vincent is so persuaded his many qualities are hard to beat that he can't doubt she will soon come back. But as she doesn't, he starts questioning himself. All the more as he realizes, to his dismay, that each time he clowns the people around him start dying of laughter...literally that is!
