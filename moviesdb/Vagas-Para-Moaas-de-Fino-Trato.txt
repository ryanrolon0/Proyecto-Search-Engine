Vagas Para Moaas de Fino Trato

 In Vitória, the middle-age piano teacher Gertrudes sublets her apartment to two younger women, the unstable Lúcia and the nurse Madalena. Gertrudes misses and daydreams her former love and has a motherhood relationship with Lúcia; Madalena has a promiscuous life, having one night stand with the most different men every day and her behavior is criticized by Gertreudes; and Lúcia is dreamer that manipulates Gertrudes and expects that the handyman Alfredo becomes her prince charming. Their conflictive relationship ends when Madalena discloses their inner feelings and secrets to each other. Gertrudes (Norma Bengell) is a middle aged lady who rents two of the rooms in her spacious upper middle class apartment (breakfast and plenty of companionship included) to two youngish women Madalena, and the apparently tormented twenty-something Lucia. Madalena is realistic - a fun-loving, sexually active night owl - who contrasts with Lucia, a dreamer and somewhat of a substitute daughter for the lonely landlady Gertrudes .
