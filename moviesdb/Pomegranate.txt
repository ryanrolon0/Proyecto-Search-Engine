Pomegranate

 Peter Franklyn, a workaholic man, almost looses the most precious thing in his life, all because of work. One Christmas day, Peter meets an old man on the street and this man tells Peter an old tale about a gastronome that lost his sense of taste and... the most precious thing in his life.
