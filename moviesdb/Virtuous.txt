Virtuous

 A guy awakes in a hospital bed unsure of how he got there - the only clue he has is a photo of an unknown woman. He begins to be haunted by visions of her & no matter which way he turns, everyone & everything leads to finding her. Discovering that she has been missing and that he maybe a suspect, he refuses to get involved. In an attempt to put and end to these haunting visions, he reluctantly sets out to help find her. By doing so he will learn that Virtue is its own reward.
