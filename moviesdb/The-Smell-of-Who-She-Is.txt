The Smell of Who She Is

 A collection of dark images and sounds taken from a relationship between a man and a woman. The relationship is presented in a series of black and white images edited to create visual rhythms varying in pace and complexity. Accompanying the visual rhythms are waves of abstract sound which ebb and flow like the cycles of a tide. The images and sound work in concert to plunge the viewer into a world of irrational thinking and raw emotion.
