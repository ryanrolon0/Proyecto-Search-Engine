Uribanul chasubnida

 "In a 19th-century classroom, a 20th-century teacher tries to educate the 21st-century students". Through the eyes of a group of high school students, the film highlights the alienation they feel as they try to reconcile their "21st-century" values and aspirations with those imposed on them by an older and more narrow-minded system.
