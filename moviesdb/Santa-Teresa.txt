Santa Teresa

 On the Day of the Dead, Ana Castillo decides that the easiest way to deal with her father's death is by ignoring it. With the help of her religious mother and schizophrenic brother Ana ends up at the hospital where her father died. Animated figures come to life and lead Ana to resolve her memory of her father and, in a way, lead her back to herself.
