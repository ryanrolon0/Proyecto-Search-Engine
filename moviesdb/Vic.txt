Vic

 "Vic" chronicles a few days in the life of Vic Reeves, a down-on-his-luck Los Angeles actor in his seventies. Haunted by memories of his former glory days in Hollywood, his dreams of returning to the limelight are revived by a late night telephone call that holds the promise of a major new role.
