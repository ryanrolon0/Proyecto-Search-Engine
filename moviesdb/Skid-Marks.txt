Skid Marks

 Three young men, dripping bravado, stand by their cars at the top of a long curved road, challenging each other to a race. One wants it to be for pink slips. Off they go. Each has a bag of tricks, and each must negotiate surprising developments, including the sudden appearance of another car and then a lightning storm. Who will win, and what price victory?
