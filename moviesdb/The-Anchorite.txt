The Anchorite

 'The Anchorite' is a moving mural of the self. A homeless muralist struggles with his painting on the rooftops of a surreal post-war city. He catches a glimpse of a young boy whom he attempts to incorporate into his work. As cold and solitude begin to overwhelm him, he begins to understand that achieving creative wholeness and a reckoning with the subject of his painting may be an impossibility. This work was created as a time-based portrait of the artist in an attempt to capture the precise creative state within a world of political, social, and economic corruption.
