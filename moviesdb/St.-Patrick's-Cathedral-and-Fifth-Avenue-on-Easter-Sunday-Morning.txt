St. Patrick's Cathedral and Fifth Avenue on Easter Sunday Morning

 One of the sights of the season in New York City, is witnessing the multitude of people leaving St. Patrick's Cathedral after service, Easter Sunday morning. Easter Sunday, March 31st, 1902, was a perfect day, the sky being absolutely cloudless. Our photographers were on hand, and secured a perfect picture of this great event. Our position was most advantageous, the camera occupying an elevation and commanding a view of several thousand people, all of whom appear in the film at one time. After the congregation left the church, our panoramic camera is set in motion and a panoramic view of Fifth Avenue, with the thousands of people going and coming on both East and West side, is shown. Also hundreds of fashionable equipages, stage coaches, and automobiles, etc. are passing up the avenue in a perfect unbroken stream. A most interesting scene from start to finish. Sold complete or in separate lengths.
