 Nick Venizelos is a barber with a passion for gambling. His buddies put together $10,000 for him to gamble with against the syndicate. He gets cleaned out through a crooked game and vows revenge. After that he takes over. Nick Venizelos, an immigrant Greek barber, has an uncommon affinity for poker and other sorts of wagering and a group of his friends bankroll him in a big game, where his weakness for pretty blondes is taken advantage of by sleazy operator Sleepy Sam who cleans him out in a rigged game. Nick accepts help from his buddy Jack as they turn the tables on the grifters, but triumph soon changes to tragedy.
