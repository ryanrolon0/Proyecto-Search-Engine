Trained Dogs and Elephants

 Another exceedingly effective film, showing some of the latest tricks performed by Lockhart's marvelous animals. In this picture a novelty is introduced in a combination elephant and dog act. The elephant carries hoops attached to its legs and as it walks along at a rapid gait French poodles jump in and out through the hoops. The picture ends with a remarkable balancing act done by a baby elephant on four tall pedestals. A duplicate film of about 100 feet of the latter part of this film can be had.
