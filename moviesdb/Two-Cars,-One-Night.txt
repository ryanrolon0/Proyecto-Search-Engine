Two Cars, One Night

 How do people connect? At night a car is parked by the Te Kaha Hotel and Pub in rural New Zealand. Two brothers, about 10 years of age, sit inside waiting for their parents. Ed is reading a book. Romeo notices a girl about their age sitting in a car not far away, also waiting for her parents. Romeo shouts a few insults at her. She ignores him for awhile then answers back. Later, Romeo sneaks up and tries to scare her. They talk; he brags, she calls him out. She's Polly, maybe 11. He notices a ring she has - studded with diamonds. He yells questions at Ed. He asks if he can see the ring. Should she let him hold it?
