Reciprocity

 If you looked in the mirror, what would you see? Seemingly trivial question, but as reciprocity proves looks can definitely be deceiving. Our young protagonist Liam is suffering from frightening daydreams. As a series of murders occur with an unknown killer who looks chillingly similar to Liam, he begins to doubt his sanity. Those around Liam watch a man spiral out of control to a point where they are left wondering who he really is.
