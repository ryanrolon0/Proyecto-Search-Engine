The Waterboard

 A psychological, experimental horror film, 'The Waterboard' concerns issues of extra-judicial torture intersecting with the problem of human evil. The Mystery Tramp, a rogue CIA agent, interrogates a nameless Spook, while an informed female voice-over illuminates the disturbing tableau. Featuring a realistic depiction of the controversial form of torture known as 'waterboarding' and dabbed with touches of surrealism, the film presents a sketch of a sociopathic character who's fallen down the slippery slope by the permission to inflict suffering under the guise of government security.
