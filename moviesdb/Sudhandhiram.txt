Sudhandhiram

 After the passing away of their widower freedom fighter father, Raghu looks after the financial affairs of a hoodlum and extortionist, Sopraj. Raghu's brother, Vishwa, also works for Sopraj by fixing matches, as well as participates in daredevil stunts and boxing bouts. Both brothers will soon be thrown into conflict with each other after Vishwa agrees to testify against Sopraj for killing a man named Vikram, the brother of his sweetheart, Divya. During this course, Vishwa will also find out the truth about their deceased father, and the amount of influence Sopraj has over Raghu - who will leave no stone unturned in order to compel Vishwa from going against their employer.
