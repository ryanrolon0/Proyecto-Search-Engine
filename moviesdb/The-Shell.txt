The Shell

 A Convict escapes prison with the help of a dying Doctor. When he arrives at his 'savior's' house, the Convict is ushered in and fed a home cooked meal. The Doctor then reveals to the Convict, the cost of his freedom. Appalled, the Convict tries to resist, but the Doctor is one step ahead. The meal was drugged. The Convict falls to the floor, unconscious. When he awakes, it is unlike any place the Convict has been before. At first he wonders if he is dead. But then the Doctor appears and reveals that they are, in fact, in the Convict's mind. The Doctor plans to 'kill' the Convict and steal this body as his own. With less than a few weeks to live, it is the Doctor's last chance at life. The Doctor merely has to convince the Convict that he has died in a past memory. Once the Convict's mind believes he is dead, the Doctor will be free to occupy his body. The Doctor forces the Convict to relive painful memories, each time twisting them brutally, trying to convince the Convict that he has been killed. The Convict is forced to deal with his terrible past and resist the Doctor's increasing manipulations. As their wills collide, and the truth of the Convict's imprisonment is revealed, is it possible for either man to survive?
