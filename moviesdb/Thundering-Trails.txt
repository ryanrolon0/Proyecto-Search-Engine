Thundering Trails

 In 1871, the Rangers are disbanded due to lack of funds so Monroe County sets up it's own police force. All ranchers must pay for protection, but those who do not are quickly robbed and/or killed. Johnny Steele, is head of the police, but his second in command is working for Judge Morgan, who leads the outlaws. When the Three Mesquiteers try to help Ben Walker, they are accused of his murder and of trying to rob the stage.
