The Singer Downstairs

 "THE SINGER DOWNSTAIRS" is a light-hearted story about a struggling Singer, named Jericka Cherry who agrees to take in a cynical 8 year old orphaned girl named Molly Townes when the girl offers her all the money she has to help take care of her. As they bond, the Singer teaches her to trust again, and the little Girl encourages her to hang onto a waning singing career. Battling the obstacles of time and money, they take us on a fun and often unpredictable ride.
