Seaside Adventures

 The youngest son of poverty-stricken Old Mother Rabbit, who lives in a show in a forest, leaves home to seek his fortune in order to help his family. He soon fins himself in an amazing land where trees dance, sing and play. The baby rabbit saves the frog kind from the clutches of a hungry crane. He is given a pile of gold coins as a reward.
