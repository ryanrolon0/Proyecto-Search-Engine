Protons to Picasso

 When Randy a goofball skater finds his stepbrother Russell, an Oxford scholar at the community pool, the 'bonding time' that Randy had been waiting for begins. Both must spend the summer in their parents condo on the Mesa of Santa Barbara. Randy doesn't have a clue where he is heading in life except for the next party. Russell doesn't have the patience to indulge Randy's advice on women. A stoned- skater friend, macho life guard and pool babes arrive on the scene and the comedy never lets up!
