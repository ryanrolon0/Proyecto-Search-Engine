Rape in a Small Town

 On Easter Eve, 1991, 75-year-old Florence Holway was brutally attacked, beaten and raped in her small rural New England home. Barely surviving the attack, she vowed that she would do everything in her power to see that her 25 year old attacker, John LaForest, who had a past criminal record no less, could never do the same thing again to another innocent woman.
