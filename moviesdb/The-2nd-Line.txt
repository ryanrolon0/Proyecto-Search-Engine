The 2nd Line

 At funerals in New Orleans, there are two lines; the first are the mourners, the second are the revelers. Micah Revere is a broke musician packing to move away from his idyllic Southern Oregon town, where his neighbors wrestle with their own baggage. Emotional and distraught, Micah grabs his trumpet and blows a note that rousts the neighborhood. Micah's anguish fuels a block party that becomes the second line. His unusual goodbye will move them all.
