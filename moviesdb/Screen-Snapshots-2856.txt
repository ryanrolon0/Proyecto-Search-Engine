Screen Snapshots 2856

 James Gleason drops by to visit Ralph Staub at the Columbia lot and Staub, as he was inclined to do, pulls out a few reels of World War II "Screen Snapshots", and he and Gleason reminisce about the footage, while the camera turns and, presto, yet another Screen Snapshots entry comprised of about 90% stock footage. This one shows movie-and-radio stars and names around Hollywood entertaining the troops at various California Army/Navy/Marine camps. Faces seen and voices heard (again) include Carole Landis, Groucho Marx and Jack Benny.
