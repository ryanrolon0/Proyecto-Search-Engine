Saving My Family Farm

 Saving My Family Farm is a personal documentary focusing on the sale of filmmaker Kathleen Mackey's family's farm in Whitby, Ontario. The farm was in her family for six generations, and while urban growth in the area was a major factor in the decision to sell the farm, family dynamics played an equally significant role. Its sale in 2010 spurred explorations into the disappearance of family farms in Ontario, gender issues and the preservation of the farm through documentary and family archives, such as photographs, home videos, and a Mackey Family History book.
