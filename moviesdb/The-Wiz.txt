The Wiz

 Twenty-four-year-old Dorothy--a kindergarten teacher born, raised, and still working in Harlem--is celebrating Thanksgiving with her extended family, but she doesn't seem to be thankful for much in life. She lives a self-imposed sheltered life; she is shy and unfulfilled. Things change for her when she is caught up in a snowstorm while chasing after her dog, Toto. She and her dog are transported to the mysterious land of Oz, where she is informed that the only possible way to find her way back to New York is through the assistance of the powerful wizard in the Emerald City. As Dorothy goes searching for the wizard, she befriends some creatures who are facing problems in life just like her. In their quest to find and get help from the wizard, they also face Evillene, the equally evil sister of Evermean, the wicked witch whom Dorothy inadvertently killed when she entered Oz, and who may be their biggest obstacle in achieving their dreams. In this version of the classic story - based on the smash Broadway musical - Dorothy is a shy 24-year-old Harlem kindergarten teacher who is brought by a snowstorm to the mysterious Land of Oz, a sprawling, decaying, nightmarish, and dangerous megalopolis that resembles the physical characteristics of New York City. The re-telling of the tale includes various urban settings, extreme sadness and melancholy, and features themes of rising above one's background and the expectations of others.
