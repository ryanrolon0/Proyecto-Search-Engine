Ski for Two

 Planning a vacation, Woody reads in the newspaper about Swiss Chard Lodge which promises lots of good food (which, as Woody says, is his "favorite dish"). He heads over to said lodge but, upon arriving, is told by owner Wally Walrus that he must make reservations ahead of time... which he has not. Wally throws the pest out but Woody is able to re-enter the premises disguised as none other than Santa Claus. He robs Wally of his food but, once alone with his sack, discovers quite a surprise inside. The brochure says, "Enjoy Winter Sports at Swiss Chard Lodge, Sunstroke Valley, Idaho." Winter sports are fine, but what attracts Woody Woodpecker is the promise of "excellent food." Food, Woody declares, is his favorite dish. Soon, Woody, who puts on his skis in advance, is on his way to Idaho on a train that must make its way there by tunneling through the snow. At the train station, the machine shakes the snow from itself and tosses Woody off its caboose. The woodpecker lands next to a sign that says, "Swiss Chard Lodge / (40 Miles as the Crow Flies) / But Who Wants to Ride with an Old Crow?" Woody, declaring that he knows a shortcut, skis through the hills at top speed, singing "The Sleigh." Finally, he arrives at the lodge, but the sign next to the door says, "Positively No Admittance without a Reservation." And the proprietor, Wally Walrus, makes it clear that he means it. But Woody is determined to have some of that delicious food and will even stoop to posing as Santa Claus (on October 3rd) to get it.
