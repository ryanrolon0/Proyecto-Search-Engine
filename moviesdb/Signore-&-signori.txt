Signore & signori

 A citizen of the Veneto in her sixties. Three stories of "love in the country" confidence but he becomes betrayed by him - the medic speaks about his patient with some befriend gossips; a bank employee, after a tormented affair with the young waitress of a bar, returns to be single - disappointed and made bitter; some boys exploit the gratitude of an ingenuous girl from the vicinity. Her father denunciates them but withdraws all efforts after getting a compensation and saves them from jail.
