The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf

 This film is a stop-motion animated adaptation of Aesop's classic fable, 'The Shepherd boy and the Wolf,' also widely known as 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf.' Although many people are familiar with the traditional moral tale, which demonstrates the consequences of lying, this adaptation follows Aesop's story with a less-than-traditional approach. Not only is the character of the boy brought to life through his humorous antics, the entire film is enhanced through unique artistry that combines 10,000 still photographs with modern graphics.
