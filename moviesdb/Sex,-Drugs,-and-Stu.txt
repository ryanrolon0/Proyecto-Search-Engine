Sex, Drugs, and Stu

 Stu and Rupert like to get high and go to the gym to watch the ladies. But Stu's stoner existence is interrupted when he loses his job and is evicted from his apartment by his Irish mobster landlord. A sexy woman at the gym overhears his problem and takes him in, only he must be 'totally hers'. When Stu discovers she's a cop, things start to get complicated. To make matters worse, Crazy Daisy shows up pregnant with twins claiming he's the daddy. Stu needs all the help he can get from his friends, and an oddball shrink, to set things back in order.
