Tempi duri per i vampiri

 Baron Osvaldo Lambertenghi is forced to sell his ancestral castle; when it's converted into a hotel, he stays on as a bellboy. His mysterious uncle arrives--and turns out to be a vampire. When his uncle vampirizes Osvaldo, the newly-minted blood-sucker gallops about the castle sipping from the necks of dozens of beautiful female guests.
