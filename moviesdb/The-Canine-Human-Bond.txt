 Millions of Americans have dogs as pets. Many are even considered a part of the family.

These dogs are trusted and relied on every single day to save and protect human life. This film exposes the special bond that exists between search and rescue dogs and their handlers, a diabetes detecting dog and his handler, and police K9s and their handlers.
