The Red Umbrella

 An original and experimental drama / thriller challenging the "master-closeup-closeup" film shooting tradition, with no actual dialog to tell the audience what to think. Puzzle solving is to be done through a carnival of montage telling a story of love and duty, of secret and truth, of fantasy and expectation, and of innocence and betrayal.
