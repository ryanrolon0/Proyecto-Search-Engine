Tamago

 The Japanese 18-year old Kiyoshi has been living in the kitchen of his parental home for 2 years. His parents cannot seem to get through to him anymore and they are ashamed of him. To the outside world they pretend that he studies abroad. The only person Kiyoshi communicates to is his little sister. On the internet he has contact with youngsters who have all retreated from society and family life. It is with them that he talks about the things that occupy him most, such as drumming, sex, computer games, films, life and death. When Kiyoshi frightens the dinner guests the family is pushed into crisis.
