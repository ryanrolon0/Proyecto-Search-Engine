 The film concerns Helen, a 28 year-old actress who is witness to a road accident in which a young woman dies. This event, and her subsequent meeting with the young woman's fiancE, serve to set Helen free from a destructive love affair. Based loosely on Chekhov's play The Seagull, this is a story of mourning, infatuation and a route to freedom.
