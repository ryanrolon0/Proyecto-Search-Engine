She Was Asking for It

 Dario Argento meets Maria Beatty in this sado-erotic giallo about a young man (Matthew Saliba) who is tortured, humiliated and raped by two women (Danay Cragaris and Leela Marcelino) and then proceeds to inflict the kind of vengeance that gives new meaning to the term "torture-porn."
