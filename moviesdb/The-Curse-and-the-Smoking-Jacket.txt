The Curse and the Smoking Jacket

 Today a dapper, yet painfully delusional shoe-salesman, Mark, has a dramatic plan to turn his hole-of-a-life into a high-stakes adventure. One problem... his car has been stolen. The only person he has to count on is Pruess, who lives in a camper in Mark's driveway, and he's on his own path of vengeance this morning.
