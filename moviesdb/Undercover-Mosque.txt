Undercover Mosque

 A female reporter - 'Sara' - attends prayer meetings in one of the most important mosques in the UK, which claims to be dedicated to moderation and dialogue with other faiths. She secretly films shocking sermons given to the women-only congregation in which female preachers recite extremist and intolerant beliefs. As hundreds of women and children come to pray, the leading preacher calls for adulterers, homosexuals, women who act like men and Muslim converts to other faiths to be killed. "Kill him, kill him. You have to kill him, you understand. This is Islam." The film traces the links between the teachings and materials at the mosque and the Saudi Arabia religious establishment and examines the extent to which the Kingdom exports Wahhabi teachings around the world by ploughing billions of dollars into schools, mosques and charities. In the UK, the film shows the huge impact Saudi money has on supporting mosques and imams and the provision of fundamentalist teaching materials for faith schools. The documentary makers interview a former teacher at one such school who describes how the official hardline Saudi educational curriculum was taught in the school. He also shows Dispatches official Saudi textbooks that were used in Islamic studies courses last year which featured anti-Semitic and anti-Christian teachings. The undercover reporter also films inside a Saudi-funded key Muslim organisation - the Muslim World League - which claims to promote interfaith tolerance yet distributes extremist literature and according to one employee distributes Saudi money to other Muslim organisations. The film also features interviews with Islamic academics who condemn these messages of intolerance and segregation and warn of the impact this version of Islam is having on British society.
