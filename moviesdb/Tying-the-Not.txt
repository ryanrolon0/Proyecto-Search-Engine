Tying the Not

 No one believes Zoi when she says she doesn't want to get married. She knows everyone assumes it is her longtime partner, Kyle, who refuses to wed. Out of her charitable heart and her profound belief "that everyone needs to make a complete fool of themselves at least once", she comes up with a brilliant plan to prove everyone right. What's more, she has the perfect timing, venue and the dress to execute her outrageous plan wedding of her best friend, Emily, who unwittingly chose her as her bridesmaid.
