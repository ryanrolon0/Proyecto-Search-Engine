The Undertaker's Wedding

 Mario Bellini's life as an undertaker may not be filled with romance, but his funeral parlor certainly sees some action of a local mob war. While wise guys are being bumped off left and right, Mario is asked by crime boss Alberto to hide his hit man brother Rocco. A love quadrangle forms among Mario and Rocco's long-suffering wife Maria, Rocco and Mario's girlfriend Louise, and the body count suddenly rises.
