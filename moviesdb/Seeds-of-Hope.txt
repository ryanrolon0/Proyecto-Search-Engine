Seeds of Hope

 In this documentary film, Hugh Jackman & Deborra-Lee Furness travel to Ethiopia to gain first-hand experience with communities living in extreme poverty. In a remote coffee growing region, they meet a young farmer named Dukale who is lifting his family out of poverty with a zero carbon footprint. Hugh works alongside Dukale on the farm and is galvanized by what he learns from him, making and fulfilling a promise to share with the world what he has learned from Dukale -- that the issues of extreme poverty and the environment are forever linked together and entirely solvable in our lifetime.
