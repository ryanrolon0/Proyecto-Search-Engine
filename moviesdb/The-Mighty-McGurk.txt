The Mighty McGurk

 "Slag" McGurk, a former boxing champ living on memories of glories past, spends his days and nights as a bouncer/braggert/boozer at Glenson's saloon. But when "Slag" stumbles upon a young orphaned lad and agrees to help him find a relative, his life takes on a whole new meaning.
