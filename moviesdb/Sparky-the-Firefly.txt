Sparky the Firefly

 A Terrytoon that runs a couple of minutes longer than the average finds Sparky, a firefly, who loses is light and is ostracized by his own kind. His friend, the bookworm, advises him to replace his light with a flashlight bulb. His light is even more powerful than ever but his fellow fireflies now consider him a freak. But ol' Sparky saves the day when he acts as the guiding light at an airport.
