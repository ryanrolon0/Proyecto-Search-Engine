Residencia para espías

 Ms. Pendleton is the commander-in-chief of a women's training camp for western spies, recently established in Turkey. CIA agent Leyton receives a mission, to discover and destroy an ennemy group operating in the vicinities of that residence. He will manage, with the help, and sometimes extra zeal, of a number of the young women recruits.
