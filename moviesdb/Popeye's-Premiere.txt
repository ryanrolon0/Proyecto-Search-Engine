Popeye's Premiere

 Popeye and Olive are at the premiere of Popeye's new movie. He gets a little too wrapped up in the movie, interacting with it at various points, and even handing the screen version of himself a can of spinach. The movie itself is the story of Aladdin, minus the songs and about half the footage of the short it's cut from.
