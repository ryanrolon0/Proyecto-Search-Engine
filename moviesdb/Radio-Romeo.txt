 Harry Von Zell is a radio-show host who specializes in advice to the love-lorn. Marital problems are his forte, but he has more than a little difficulty explaining that to his wife. He gets into many innocent scrapes and his wife has an uncanny ability to at the most inopportune and guilt-looking time. The involved woman's jealous-husband isn't pleased, either.
