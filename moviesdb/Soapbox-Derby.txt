Soapbox Derby

 Children's drama. Two rival children's gangs in London decide to hold a soapbox derby. The Battersea Bats are rumoured to have a new design so the Victoria Victors set out to steal it. The plan things to make it look like it was one of the Bats who stole the cart. Watch out for a very young 'Michael Crawford' (qv) in his first screen appearance.
