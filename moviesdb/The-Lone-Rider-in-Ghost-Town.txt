The Lone Rider in Ghost Town

 Tom and Fuzzy investigate a ghost town which, in this case, is supposedly haunted by real ghosts. The town is an outlaw gang's hideout, and they scare folks away to protect their mine. In the third entry of the 17 films in this series (following The Lone Rider Rides On and The Lone Rider Crosses the Rio, which aren't shown in correct order of release under Movie Connections, which evidently lists series connections by alpha by year instead of by release order), Tom Cameron, the Lone Rider, and his sidekick Fuzzy Jones arrive in the town of Spring Vally in time to prevent the manhandling of Moosehide Larson by Red, henchman in the pay of Sinclair and O'Shea. Tom and Fuzzy make their way to Parker's Diggings, a ghost town, where Tom encounters Helen Clark, daughter of a famous mining engineer,Dennis Clark, who has been missing for several weeks. Helen tells Tom that her father discovered gold on some of Sinclair's property that he had a purchase option on. They are attacked by Sinclair's gang, and gang member Jim Gordon is wounded, and Tom is charged with his murder the next day. Aided by cafE entertainers Brent and Roper, Tom escapes and, after instructing Fuzzy and Moosehide to follow, trails two henchmen to the gang's hideout, where he finds Gordon still alive. Tom sets out to find Clark, while O'Shea convinces the captive Clark that he has deserted the gang and gives the mining engineer a gun and points out a path of escape. He knows that Clark will encounter Tom in the tunnel and one of them will be killed.
