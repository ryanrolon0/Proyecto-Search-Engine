The Rooster Project

 After seeing a commercial for Admiral Chicken Restaurants, the owner of a domesticated rooster decides to trade the nervous bird in for a free pot pie voucher. However, when our innocent feathered hero is mistakenly processed with the genetic product CH-6, horror, romance, tragedy, and all-around fast food fun ensue. With music by Gene Micofsky and odd nosdam of anticon records, this piece of cartoon propaganda will leave you lickin' your fingers!
