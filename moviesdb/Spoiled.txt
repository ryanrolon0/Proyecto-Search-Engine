Spoiled

 Eight-year-old Teddy is spoiled, self-centered and bratty. With failing grades and a bad attitude, his mother takes his prize possession - his video game. Stealing it back brings the wrath of Mom and she forces Teddy to donate his game to a US soldier in Afghanistan. The soldier and Teddy begin a correspondence that ultimately brings Mom and Teddy to a new understanding.
