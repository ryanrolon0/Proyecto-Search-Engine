Three Dog Night

 The story of a successful psychiatrist who returns to his homeland Australia with his American wife only to find that his long lost friend is deeply haunted by a mysterious past. Obsessed with wanting answers and impelled by his unrelenting need to rationalize the irrational, he unwittingly propels the boundaries of his marriage to be stretched beyond reasonable and possibly retractable limits.
