Three Cheers

 The worlds best jokes, are one mans life. Randy Johnson, whose lifestyle is stuck in the 80's must save the world from a nuclear disaster, and save the crown jewels. His adventure teams him up with the pope, who guides him through his devious ways. "Three Cheers" is the story of Randy Johnson, a cynical insurance investigator who feels trapped in a meaningless job. His life is falling apart, just like his car, and he is madly in love with his beautiful and successful boss Sylvia. Things get crazier when Randy discovers he has cancer, wins the lottery and is rejected by Sylvia. A nuclear warhead and The Crown Jewels of England are stolen, all on the same day. Randy embarks on a quest to save the world from nuclear disaster, restore The Crown Jewels and impress Sylvia before he dies horribly of cancer. In the ensuing globetrotting madness, Randy gets to know the Pope, who is on an adventure of his own, tracks down homeboy hoodlums from the L.A ghetto and the Mafioso from Eastern Europe. But can he save the world and himself from an unexpected doom?
