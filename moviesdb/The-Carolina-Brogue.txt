The Carolina Brogue

 Some features of early British and Scots-Irish English have been retained in the distinctive regional speech of the Carolina Outer Banks, though the language of the early European settlers evolved to take on its present-day character. Once derided as "bad English," this fading dialect has now been recognized as a national treasure. The Carolina Brogue is a revealing look at the 'hoi toide' speech and distinctive regional culture.
