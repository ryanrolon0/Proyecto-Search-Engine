The Pact

 Longstreet is a lonely vigilante drifter. He wanders into a local bar where he meets a young waitress named Bree. She clings to him until he picks fights with the bartender and Tony. Then Longstreet wanders out into the night once again and comes across an old nemesis, Hob, AKA the Devil, with whom he has an old score to settle in order to save his own soul and the souls of those less fortunate.
