The Baby Doll Murders

 Someone is killing off young women in LA, leaving a baby doll with each of the bodies. Convinced a recently released criminal is responsible, the detective pushes hard on the ex-con, who slaps him with harassment charges. Suspended from the force, he continues investigating, and finds that each of the victims were patients of a Beverly Hills doctor.
