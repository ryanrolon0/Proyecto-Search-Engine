Something Wild

 The uneventful life of business-man Charles Driggs suddenly changes when he meets the wild and sexy Lulu. When he accepts her offer to drive him back to his office, she instead takes him out of town and on a trip, leaving behind his old life. Posing as a married couple, Charles and Audrey (which turns out to be Lulu's real name) visit her mother and her highschool reunion. At this reunion they meet Audrey's violent ex-husband Ray, who's just released from jail. When Ray makes it clear that he wants Audrey back, that's when the real trouble begins. In New York, the yuppie newly promoted Vice President Charles Driggs meets the sexy and free-spirited Lulu after cheating a restaurant for fun. Lulu offers a ride for him in her convertible but she "abducts" Charles and they go to a motel in Jersey, where they spend the night together. On the next morning, she heads to her hometown in Pennsylvania to spend the weekend with Charlie. When they arrive in her mother's home, she discloses her real name - Audrey Hankel - to him and she tells her mother that Charlie is her husband. In the night, they go to her high-school reunion posing as husband and wife. But Audrey's ex-husband Ray Sinclair that has just left prison on probation meets her in the party. Audrey does not tell Charlie who Ray is and Charlie accepts Ray's invitation to drink some beer with him and his date Irene. After a while, Ray becomes violent, hits Charlie and kidnaps Audrey. But Charlie does not intend to give up on her.
