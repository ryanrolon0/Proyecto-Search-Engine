Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III

 Feeling they have finally gotten rid of Shredder, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles take a relaxing vacation in Key West, Florida. One day while watching April O'Neil's news broadcast, Shredder appears, captures April and suddenly causes Manhattan Island to raise high into the air. So the turtles head back to New York, but must defeat a plethora of Foot Soldiers and a whole new gang of Turtle waxers Bag, Leatherhead, Tokka, Rahzar, Krang and Shredder himself! This will not be an easy mission. The turtles must use all their turtle power on the Florida beach, in the ocean, aboard a battleship, on the destroyed Brooklyn Bridge, in the heart of the city which is suspended in the sky, in a sewer, in the Technodrome, atop a skyscraper, and aboard Krang's spaceship.
