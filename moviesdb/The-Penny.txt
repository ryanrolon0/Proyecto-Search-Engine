The Penny

 "The Penny" is a drama/thriller that follows a series of seemingly insignificant events in a number of people's lives. Hidden amidst their "bigger" problems, these disconnected pieces of their lives go unnoticed until they begin to fit together in a totally unexpected way. Suddenly these strangers are thrust together by what some would call luck, chance, fate, coincidence, or even destiny. But is it something even bigger than that?
