Silence of the Heart

 Skip Lewis is a 16 year old, who's been through some stuff. Like he has been having academic problems, and a girl whom he has been pursuing has told him that she has no interest in him. He tries to talk to his parents about this but can't, or thinks that they won't understand. So, he goes out and drives off a cliff. Now, his family's in denial saying that the whole thing was an accident. However, his best friend, Ken who was the last person he saw before, was told by Skip that he was considering killing himself and is feeling guilty that he didn't try to stop him.
