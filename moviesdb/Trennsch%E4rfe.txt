Trennschärfe

 Eduard is a homeless person, traveling since years through cities and landscapes. One day a long forgotten memory returns and he begins his journey back. He takes a bus, that removes him farther away from his destination. Two strangers join him on his journey, together they try to escape some mysterious deserted area. Karla, a young woman, lives alone and never leaves her apartment. Twice a week she has a visit from some older ladies, the puzzle club. These evenings are her window to the outside world. One day she gets a phone call, that confuses her properly ordered life. Old friends disappear, while unwanted reappear. The more intensive the experiences of Karla and Eduard get, the merrier the boundaries between their stories seem to blur. A poetic nightmare unfolds - time and space get out of balance.
