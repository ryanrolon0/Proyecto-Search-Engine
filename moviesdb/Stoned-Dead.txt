Stoned Dead

 Private investigators are paid $100,000 to locate two missionaries who are missing in the jungles of Panama. Their only clue is a mysterious note with the name "GILA". But what does "GILA" mean? Is it a person?...a place?...a river? Only the local people know for sure, and they're not talking.
