Robin Hood e i pirati

 On his way to (or from) the Crusades, Robin Hood is shipwrecked but saved by pirates who plan to return him home in order to ransom him to his father. The pirates' ship, however, sinks in a storm. Robin washes ashore (in England?) and learns that his father has been killed by the evil usurper, Brooks. Robin also meets a childhood sweetheart, Karin. The pirates now wash ashore as well. They decide to aid Robin in his efforts to overthrow Brooks.
