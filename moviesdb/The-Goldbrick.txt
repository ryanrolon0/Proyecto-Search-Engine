The Goldbrick

 The lazy, goldbricking Snafu is asleep, when he is suddenly awakened by the morning bugle call. He doesn't want to get up, so the "Goldbrick fairy" appears. The fairy sings to him several things to do to avoid completing any of his duties. After many successful sleazy attempts to avoid work, the fairy pulls off his disguise and reveals he is actually an enemy Japanese, who fooled him and sabotaged his army's entire defense.
