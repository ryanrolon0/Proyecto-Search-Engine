The Black Rabbit

 Mark Watson used to lead a double life. One as a loving husband, and the other as a spy for the U.S. government. The past comes back to haunt Mark in the form of The Hatter; and international crime lord Mark had once spied on. It is here that The Hatter gives Mark the ultimate ultimatum. And Mark soon discovers that becoming a spy for The Hatter involves more than just pretending to be a fictional person... but actually becoming one.
