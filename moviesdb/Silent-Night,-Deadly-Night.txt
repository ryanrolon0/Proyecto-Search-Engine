Silent Night, Deadly Night

 As a young child, Ricky witnesses his parents murdered by a psycho dressed as Santa Claus. Ricky grows up with a fear of Santa Claus. He gets a job as a garbage man and things are good until Christmas comes around. You see this year, Christmas Day and Garbage Day have fallen on the same day. All his co workers have family so Ricky has to work Christmas day on his own. To add insult his mean boss (Eric Freeman) forces him to dress up as Santa Claus for the occasion. Things start out alright but after witnessing Chip intentionally knock over a garbage bin spilling garbage all over the streets, Ricky snaps and starts his killing spree, taking out anyone who he catches taking out the garbage. Being Christmas, plenty of people have wrapping paper to throw out, who will survive the ultimate nightmare? A young boy watches his parents killed by a thief in a Santa suit. He spends his youth in an orphanage, staying quietly to his self, but his mind is further bent by an iron handed Mother Superior. He finally gets a job at a local store, where he finally snaps when he is required to wear a Santa suit, and goes on a killing spree that leads him slowly back to the orphanage.
