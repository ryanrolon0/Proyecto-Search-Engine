Sylvester

 Working in a Texas stockyard, breaking horses, Charlie's doing the best she can to support herself and her two brothers. But when she loses her job, she gets the idea to take her best bronco, Sylvester, and turn him into a lucrative profit by training him for three-day eventing. But since she knows little of dressage and show-jumping, it's going to take the help of her old boss, an ex-cavalryman, to get ready for competition.
