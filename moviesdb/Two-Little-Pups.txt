Two Little Pups

 A chicken crosses the fence into the garden, as the title puppies watch. They chase it (doing a fair amount of damage to the garden themselves in the process). The chicken gets on top of a lawnmower and really starts destroying things, including the rose garden. It finally gets stopped by a tree and is thrown into a scarecrow, where it hops around, scaring the pups. The scare-chicken goes into the doghouse, where its costume comes off, except for the hat. It sneaks off, until a ladder removes the hat. More chasing, in and around a fountain, a woodpile, a mud puddle, a basket of laundry (where the dogs trap the chicken in a corset), and finally back over the fence.
