Those Beautiful Dames

 A pitiful girl trudges through the snow to her pathetic shack. As she sleeps, a group of toys sneaks in and completely redecorates, with a toy fire engine spraying paint and various toys hanging wallpaper; they also build a fireplace and bring in nice furniture, and apparently build a large addition. When the girl awakes at midnight, the toys sing and dance for her. Finally, everyone adjourns to the new addition where a massive table is set for a party, and all enjoy cake and ice cream.
