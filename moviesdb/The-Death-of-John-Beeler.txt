The Death of John Beeler

 A vulgar children's story about a man without a dream. John Beeler's peak has come and gone long ago, and now in his mid-twenties he is contented to live out an unchallenged life, that with any luck, no one will notice. John is a pointless person that has been crippled by his fear, and in the midst of an empty existence his lights go out. When the electrician, Hank McQuarter, arrives he can't help but notice that John's lights had gone out long ago. Hank might be a misanthropic ambiguously racist electrician, but he knows how to live. This is the story of strange strangers finding a friendship that will take them to places they've never dreamed of.
