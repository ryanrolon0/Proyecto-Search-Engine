Warthog

 It's THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT, but for the three executives of Warthog Inc., it's business as usual. They're the only ones who show up for work Monday morning while the rest of the office, indeed, the rest of the world, has stayed at home. Instead of sitting around waiting for the final end, these three start dealing with the crisis the only way they know how...Increasing market share.
