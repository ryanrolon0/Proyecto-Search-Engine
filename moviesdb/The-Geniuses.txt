The Geniuses

 When Johnny and Sterling find out the girl of their mutual dreams is getting married to a hot shot entrepreneur, they decide to take action and become entrepreneurs themselves in an effort to win their true love's heart. In "The Genuises" we follow the two ambitious morons as they try one hair-brained scheme to the next in an effort to steal the love of Tanya.
