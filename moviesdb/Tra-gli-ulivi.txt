Tra gli ulivi

 Stefania and her husband, a successful and powerful mogul, live in a beautiful villa set among acres of lush olive trees just a few steps from the sea. Stefania lives a quite, private life. She is gracious, elegant and an accomplished pianist; the perfect hostess, the ideal executive wife; She is also the exact opposite of her identical twin sister, the sexually uninhibited party-girl, Rossana. An increasing source of embarrassment to Stefania, Rossana's behavior takes a destructive turn when she crosses an unacceptable boundary. Contention escalates and Stefania's well-ordered life begins to disintegrate. In the midst of their personal turmoil, two brutal murders take place in the city, and police uncover a trail that leads back to the villa, between the olive trees.
