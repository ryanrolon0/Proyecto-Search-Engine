Utilities

 Mary lives in filth in a broken down little trailer in an obscure trailer park with where she takes care of her little brother that and her near comatose mother. When the Utility man comes to the trailer to shut the gas off one day before school, Mary engages in an elaborate game with the Utility man attempting to get his pity and keep the family's power supply turned on.
