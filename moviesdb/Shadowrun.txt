Shadowrun

 Shadowrun is an action RPG of epic proportions. You take on the role of Joshua, a Shadowrunner out to discover who murdered his brother. Along the way you get into street brawls, deadly gunfights, run the Matrix, slip into and out of the MegaCorps, explore the wild wilderness and deal with every low-life mage and high-tech cyber Street Samurai in Seattle. With an overhead view for physical combat and a third person POV view when on Matrix runs, the game allows two other characters to join your party, temporarily of 'for life'.
