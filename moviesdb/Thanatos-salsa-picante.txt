Thanatos salsa picante

 A Night at the morgue. Nothing happens besides the usual boring bloody (litteraly) job. Until two cops come, bringing a strange body, needing an autopsy right away, disturbing the forensic in his spare time. Troubles will start as soon as they will discover that the body may not be completely dead !
