Watan

 Ostensibly a Central Asian war fantasy about a conflict between the Cossacks and the Tartars, a tale that advocates national independence. The Cossacks are oppressed by the despotic Russian king and his minister Jabir, who has Tartar blood in him. General Murad covertly sides with the opposition, gets arrested for treason and escapes. He meets the wild Gulnar and gets her to spy as a maid of Princess Nigar. Nigar falls for Murad and Gulnar withdraws from the scene for the sake of her nation.
