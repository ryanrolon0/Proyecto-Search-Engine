Smokey and the Judge

 Margo, Carol and Maria are three sexy young ladies who decide to pursue their dream of becoming a successful R&B trio after being released from prison. They get a job performing at a sleazy remote roadside dive located in a tiny desert town. Moreover, the perky threesome run afoul of a lecherous sheriff, an equally libidinous judge and their meddlesome parole officer.
