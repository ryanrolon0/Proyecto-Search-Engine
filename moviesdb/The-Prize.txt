The Prize

 For some reason, this year's Nobel prize in literature has been awarded to the young author Andrew Craig, who seems to be more interested in women and drinking than writing. Another laureate is Dr. Max Stratman, the famous German-American physicist who comes to Stockholm with his young and beautiful niece Emily. The Foreign Department also gives him an assistant during his stay, Miss Andersson. Craig soon notices that Dr. Stratman is acting strangely. The second time they meet, Dr. Stratman does not even recognize him. In Stockholm, Sweden to collect his Nobel Prize in Literature, American writer Andrew Craig stumbles across a plot to kidnap a fellow Nobel laureate. On arrival at the hotel, he meets physicist Prof. Max Stratman. They have a pleasant conversation and agree to meet for drinks the next day. When they meet again however, the Professor acts as if he's never met Craig. With his propensity for partying and drinking too much, Craig doesn't have a great deal of credibility with his hosts, including the person assigned to him by the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Inger Lisa Andersson. An attempt on Craig's life and a chance encounter at a local hospital provides the evidence he needs however.
