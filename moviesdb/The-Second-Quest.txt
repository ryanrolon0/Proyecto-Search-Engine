The Second Quest

 Three old friends are re-united in hospital owing to an accident that happened to one of them. Whilst together they recall their ill-fated motorbike trip to the Isle of Man that they made in 1960. Ostensibly, their trip was to ride the famous TT race course but inevitably girls and their continuing quest to lose their virginity was never far from their minds!
