The Price of Fear

 The co-owner of a racetrack discovers that his partner has sold out to a gangster. The gangster plans to take sole control of the track and plans to get rid of his new partner. The partner's problems are just beginning, though, as he finds himself involved with a beautiful woman who, unknown to him, was involved in a hit-and-run and is trying to set him up for the crime.
