The Contract of Jude

 Jude is a struggling young maintenance worker in a troubled relationship, who is rapidly losing his grip on life due to a serious drug addiction, and the loss of a child. Induced by substance abuse, and renderings of iniquitous nature, he tentatively creates a contract that can only be honored, by the devil. He begins to receive mysterious packages at his doorstep that at first, seem to answer his prayers, but ultimately accelerate his course down the path of destruction.
