TeppanDead

 Hiro Watanabe has the soul of a Samurai Warrior. There's only one problem he was born 500 years too late. On the other side of the globe. Working in a Japanese Steakhouse in America is far from the heroic life Hiro dreams of. His skills are solid, but he craves something more. One night, he'll get it. A mysterious outbreak brings through the door just the opportunity Hiro needs to prove himself.
