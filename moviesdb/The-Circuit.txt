The Circuit

 "The Circuit" is a 'mokumentary' web series chronicling the week in the life of working actor Chris Johnson, who struggles to 'make it' as he auditions for acting work in New York City. It is a comedy that satirizes the plight of auditioning actors and illustrates some of the bizarre situations that they encounter and provoke. Though fictionalized, the material in this film was selected from real life experiences of working actors.
