Revelation

 The dead walk the Earth. Seeking shelter, two figures stumble upon a man living alone in the tunnels of a large college campus. This individual seems quite content in his isolation and doesn't look highly upon outsiders. Over the period of a couple days the two attempt to figure out if the man is a saint or a threat.
