The Honkys

 The Honkys is an off-beat short film about the members of the honky family - an eclectic, non-traditional, multi-racial New York family who live in a rundown part of Brooklyn, New York. We follow their wildly preposterous lives through the many demanding, and problematic circumstances they find themselves in. The Honkys is have been described as a cross between Arrested Development in the ghetto, and the absurd misadventures of the The Adams Family. The Honkys are like The Jeffersons for a new generation. The show centers on this dysfunctional family; a family that love and respect one another other regardless of color, creed or sexual orientation. Under the Honky roof everybody is equal. The Honkys are keeping family values alive. Viewers can simply drop into a Honky family conversation and watch them channel-surf while discussing various everyday subjects like birth control, or Honky Granddads latest love interest. The show is never afraid to portray its characters with all their flaws and idiosyncratic behavior. Semi-regular characters pop in and out of the Honky's lives; The Philosophical Pigs who are stalking Shoogy, OG who is infatuated with Honky Bitch and Shenghis Khan the Honky's landlord. There will be lots of references to other things that are going on in the world, in culture and in music. Every week is different on The Honkys.
