The Sissy Duckling

 Harvey Fierstein wrote this cartoon fable about Elmer, a sensitive duckling whose schoolmates tease him for being a sissy. However, after his unusual talents help him save a life, the other members of the flock learn to respect him as he is. This special episode from Season 6 of HBO's "Happily Ever After Tales for Every Child" is a twist in Hans Christian Anderson's classic "Ugly Duckling" tale. This story about tolerance and true beauty casts Harvey as Elmer, the "sissy" duckling. The other ducklings pick on him because he's "different" (meaning he doesn't like sports like the other boy ducklings, but excels at creative "sissy" things, such as cooking, fashion and art). Mama loves Elmer unconditionally, but his dad doesn't understand him at all. After Elmer refuses to migrate with the flock and spends the entire winter nursing him back to health, Dad looks at his son with new eyes.
