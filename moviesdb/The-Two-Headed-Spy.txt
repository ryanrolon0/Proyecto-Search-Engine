The Two-Headed Spy

 World War II spy thriller supposedly based on true story. British secret agent successfully infiltrates Nazi military, achieves rank of general during WWII. He gains full confidence of entire Nazi high command, including Fuhrer Adolf Hitler himself, save one suspecting German officer. All the while the spy passes war-winning information to Allies assisted by two loyal Berlin contacts, first a man then a nightclub singer. A war drama with love-interest relationship and a cliffhanger finale. Also memorable is frightening Adolf Hitler always portrayed from behind, face unseen but with snarling, tyrannical voice.
