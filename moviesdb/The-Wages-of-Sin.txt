The Wages of Sin

 This is a sequel to 2446 [THE WAGES OF SIN. A - MURDER]. A young clergyman who has come to the rescue of the young woman, but who arrives too late, engages in a hand-to-hand conflict with the ruffian and is rapidly besting him when another thug enters and attempts to shoot the clergyman. The latter knocks the revolver away and the bullet, flying wide of its mark, kills the murderer. Police break in, in the meantime, and capture the second thug. Both scenes are well acted, and can be recommended as good examples of this class of subject.
