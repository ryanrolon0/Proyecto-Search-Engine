The Fraser River Journey

 The Fraser River Journey is a documentary film that follows a group of twelve Aboriginal youths from all over British Columbia on a wild raft trip down the Fraser River. Wielding tiny but high-powered waterproof video cameras, they set out to document their adventures on one of the most stunning, diverse, and dangerous river systems in the world, and in the process learn important things about their province, their heritage, and themselves. The film is set in the context of the bicentennial of Simon Fraser's 1808 exploration of the river which now bears his name, providing both a historical point of reference and an opportunity to take a hard look at the past, present, and future of Aboriginal life in British Columbia.
