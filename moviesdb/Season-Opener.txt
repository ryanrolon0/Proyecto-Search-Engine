Season Opener

 They pay to play. They practice after their day jobs end. They play on a high school field. They play for the love of the game- they play because it's in their blood. Men from all walks of life come for an opportunity to test themselves in the football arena, some with dreams of a professional career. This is the story of Semi-pro football, the LaBelle Community Football league and the South Bay Skulls (Manhattan Beach California).
