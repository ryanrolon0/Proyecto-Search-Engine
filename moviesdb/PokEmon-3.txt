PokEmon 3

 When Molly Hale's father goes missing, the strange Pokemon that he was studying come to Molly by the power of the strange little blocks. The Pokemon, the Unown, create Entei to act as Molly's father, and, because of her wish to have a mother too, Entei only goes and kidnaps Delia Ketchum, who just happens to be Ash's mom. So Ash, Misty and Brock go to the Hale mansion to stop these strange events once and for all...before time runs out for life as we know it.
