The Mistress Club

 Three women catch their husbands cheating and instead of getting mad they get even. They form 'the mistress club' where they choose to get revenge on their spouses by sleeping with other men. Everything is great until they are each faced with breaking the number one rule of the club and getting emotionally involved.
