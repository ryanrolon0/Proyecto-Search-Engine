 Big wave pioneer Ross Clarke-Jones and two-time world champion Tom Carroll are two Aussie surfing legends who have spent the last few years scouring the ends of the earth to ride the most dangerous waves they can find. Now they're taking their search to New Zealand to endure the freezing temperatures, rugged terrain and inhospitable conditions of remote Fiordland in Storm Surfers Storm Surfers building involves strategy, timing, preparation and tracking the largest oceanic storms in the world. That's where meteorologist and surf forecaster Ben Matson comes in. Using the latest storm prediction technology, he helps Ross and Tom track swells and time their arrival to a matter of hours in a mad, high-stakes race against time and the elements to conquer and film massive waves. Their latest adventure into the unknown of Fiordland sees them joined by local big wave surfer Doug Young as they overcome almost impossible terrain, deal with the harshest conditions of their careers, have Mother Nature test their tracking skills to the limits, and come face to face with an Antarctic storm.
