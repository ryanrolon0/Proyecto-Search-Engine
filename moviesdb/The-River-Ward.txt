The River Ward

 70000 young adults are diagnosed with cancer in the US each year. Roughly 500000 are currently living with the disease. 150 of them attended First Descents last year. THE RIVER WARD dives into the lives of four FD participants and chronicles their transformation from the fragile hollow shells of their former selves into the strong, confident, independent and hopeful survivors they are now.
