Surrender in Paradise

 A ship sinks in the South Seas...The survivors make it to a remote, uncharted island. Just one man...but, oh so many gorgeous girls! Filmed entirely on location in the South Seas, on an island many have called the most lush on the planet. The action is hot, heavy and sweltering. A throbbing adventure.
