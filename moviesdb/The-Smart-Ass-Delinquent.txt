The Smart Ass Delinquent

 The "Smart Ass" Krystina King is renting a room with a not-so-average American couple - a pair who seem frighteningly out of time. Every thing is perfectly normal, if the Twilight Zone is your idea of normal and perfect. Lynn LeMay and Mikem Horner are the strange couple. Just as strange, their son Wally and someone who sits at their dinner table known only as "the Beaver". The battle of wills - and there is always a battle of wills in a "Smart Ass" movie - comes down to whether the sitcom parents can instill their outdated morality into King, or if she, with the help of "the Beaver," can get LeMay and Horner to let their hair down ... along with their britches.
