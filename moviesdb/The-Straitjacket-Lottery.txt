The Straitjacket Lottery

 Boris, a familiar blue collar worker, is issued his orders for the day's patient transfer eleven o'clock. But when a patient with intense claustrophobia manages to overcome her illness by leading the way for the other patients to escape, Boris is confronted with an empty bus. With the clock ticking, he tries his best to recover the patients, but after his attempts are foiled, Boris has to face facts - either he makes the transfer, or he's out of a job. So, in his compulsion to deliver, Boris decides to fill his quota by enticing some unsuspecting civilians onto the bus. The Straitjacket Lottery is a comedic short film which takes us on an outlandish ride on a hospital bus and shows us that we're each entitled to our psychosis.
