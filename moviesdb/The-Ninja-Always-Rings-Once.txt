The Ninja Always Rings Once

 When a ninja-obsessed pizza delivery boy rescues you from under the claws of your mortal enemies, it only makes sense that you return the favor by teaching him everything you know about the art of ninjutsu- right? It made sense to Takeshi Banzai, an over-the-hill ninja master who naively takes as his student Lance- a pie-slinging man-child ruining his father's business by propositioning customers for a little more than a good tip. Already distraught over being ambushed on a mission for the first time (among other 'dysfunctions'), Takeshi soon learns that teaching Lance holds another painful lesson when the aging assassin underestimates the severity of his student's eccentricities. Now with ninja powers, Lance returns to his immature antics putting both their lives in mortal danger while he drags Takeshi kicking and screaming through his inner world, which through Lance's childlike eyes bears a striking resemblance to an 80's action movie- complete with a training montage. Before their time is up, Takeshi reveals an ancient ninja secret that just might solve Lance's trouble with the ladies and Lance "spurs" Takeshi's own childhood obsession to surface. In time (30 minutes or less, guaranteed!) the puerile Romeo and crusty old curmudgeon may help each other find a middle-ground, that is, if they survive.
