Speed Dating

 When a group of loner outcast singles try desperately to find true love through a speed dating event, the most unlikely ones actually achieve their goal. The whole point of speed dating is to determine what kind of a person is sitting across from you and if you would want to date them. Everyone has their quirks and issues, some more obvious than others. The ones with the more obvious outward issues are judged and laughed at by the ones with issues that are more easily hidden, but in the end, it was only the ones with those clear outer issues that had the ability and openness in their hearts to find true love.
