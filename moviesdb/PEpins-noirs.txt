PEpins noirs

 A lost and found department somewhere in a middle-sized town. Eddie, a trainee clerk, is learning his job under the supervision of HervE, his superior. He soon finds out that his work is repetitive but can occasionally get fascinating. Like on the day a stolen red leather handbag lands in the office and its content is spread over his desk. Fascinated by the object, his only aim from this moment is to trace and find the lady who owns it and to show her how much he ... wants her.
