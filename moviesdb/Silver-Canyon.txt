 During the Civil War, U.S.Army scouts Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and "Cougar" Claggett (Pat Buttram) are detailed to Utah to bring in Confederate guerilla raider Wade McQuarrie (Jim Davis) who is interfering with Federal supply lines. They track the raiders to Gateway, a frontier post commanded by Colonel Middler (Edgar Dearing) who has a daughter, Dell (Gail Davis) and a son, Walt (Bob Steele). Walt secretly supports McQuarrie's actions. Gene and Dell are captured by McQuarrie but escape. During the Civil War the Union Army sends Gene to find the gorilla raider McQuarrie who is raiding Union supply trains. Gene's pal Pat deserts the Army to accompany him. When McQuarrie and his men pose as Union soldiers, Gene is quickly on to them and tries to warn the Commanding Officer. But McQuarrie gets Gene and Pat thrown into jail, kills the Commander, and loots the town.
