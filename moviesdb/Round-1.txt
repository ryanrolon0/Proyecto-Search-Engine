However, he quickly experiences a setback and returns to Japan where he meets a female con artist named Nene. His involvement in big-time crime begins when he stumbles upon a much sought after treasure, a Korean incense burner said to be valued at 1 billion yen. As syndicates from both Japan and Korea face off, the stakes are raised. Toppo calls on an old half Korean half Japanese friend, Dandy, and with Nene, forms a trio ready to take a dangerous gamble . . .
