Professor Mamlok

 A Jewish surgeon, a war veteran, brillant scientist and respected citizen becomes a victim of the mad anti-semitic purge and stripped of all his possessions and discarded by the hospital. He is pressed back into service to perform an operation on a Nazi leader, and then machine-gunned as a reward.
