The Little Wise Quacker

 Barney's hunting ducks. Alas, all his attempts to shoot ducks are thwarted by the rule book, which forbids shooting before sunrise or shooting sleeping ducks, but allows shooting any duck in the air. This means the only duck Barney finds after sunrise refuses to either wake up or go in the air.
