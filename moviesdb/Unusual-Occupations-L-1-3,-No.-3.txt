Unusual Occupations L-1-3, No. 3

 The "Unusual Occupations" crew visits radio's "Amos and Andy" (Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden), who qualify for unusual as white men playing black performers, and then they drop in on young ice-skating star Twinkle Watts, also an accomplished bowler, a couple of years before Republic's Herbert J. Yates signed her to appear in (and mess up)some 1943-44 circa B-westerns starring Don Barry and/or Allan Lane.
