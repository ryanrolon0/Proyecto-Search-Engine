Springed Migration

 Springed Migration tells an unlikely story about overcoming obstacles...that didn't necessarily need to be overcome. A few months after moving day, two house mates are faced with the question with an old rusty trampoline that won't come apart? They gather together friends, neighbors, and complete strangers to help carry the trampoline by hand 6 miles across the city of Austin. They stop along the route to encourage onlookers to take a turn on the trampoline and then join them for a beer, creating a moving block party that brings them all the way to their new home.
