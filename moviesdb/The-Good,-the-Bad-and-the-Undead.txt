The Good, the Bad and the Undead

 As soon as two criminals are arrested by two patrolling officers, a zombie apocalypse erupts and takes over a small town. Taking refuge in the local school, they must all work together in order to survive. Johnny 'Vodka' and Rosie 'Red Lips' had the perfect bank heist going until the dead rose from the graves, and things only went from bad to worse when the were arrested by two local cops. DCI William Dobbs and DC Jill Lucas not only have to deal with two difficult criminals during a zombie invasion but they also have to put aside the fact that they are having an affair. Unfortunatly, the cops don't like the criminals, the criminals don't like the cops and the undead are gagging for their flesh. Filled with tension, violent action and witty one-liners, 'The Good, The Bad and The Undead' does exactly what it says on the tin.
