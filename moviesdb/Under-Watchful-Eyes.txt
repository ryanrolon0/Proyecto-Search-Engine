Under Watchful Eyes

 Six college students leave school for the weekend to one of the student's aunt's house. When they arrive, they soon realize that the aunt has moved out, but left all of her belongings there. As they start getting comfortable in the house, weird things start happening. There are strange figures in the dark, quiet whispers from behind, and it becomes obvious there's someone that doesn't want them there. After the six students realize that the house is haunted, they pack up to leave but a horrific force holds them back. The six students are now trapped in this house with no way out and no communication to the outside world. They soon find that their weekend away from school is going to turn deadly, if not by the haunting in the house, then by one another.
