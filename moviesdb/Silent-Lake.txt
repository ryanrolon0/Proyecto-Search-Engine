Silent Lake

 A girl is in a sleep. There is a silent lake inside of her. She is walking around the lake, at the same time, she is sleeping, and dreaming in silence. One time she celebrates beauty of nature, and the other time she stands still surrounded by enormous amount of trashes. She tries to see what she can't see.
