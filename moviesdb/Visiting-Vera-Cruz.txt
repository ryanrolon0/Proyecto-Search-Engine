Visiting Vera Cruz

 Vera Cruz is Mexico's chief seaport. Over four centuries earlier, Cortez landed at Vera Cruz where he was met by Montezuma. An imposing fort, the Castillo de San Juan, overlooks the city's harbor. It was once used as a penal settlement. But most of the harbor area has been renovated, with modern buildings serving the port functions. In the remainder of the city, old Spanish buildings remain, making it one of the most historic and Spanish influenced cities in the Republic of Mexico. Among the historic buildings is city hall, said to be the oldest in the western hemisphere. The city's residential districts are a mixture of old and new, but always Spanish in their architecture. Folk dancing is an important ritual in the city, whose children learn the dances as soon as they are able to stand. One such dance is the bow dance, where the dancers try to tie a rope of cloth into a bow with their feet. As Vera Cruz is a coastal city, fishing is an important commercial and recreational activity and frolicking on the beach a favorite pastime. We visit Veracruz, "the most Spanish of Mexico's cities," the port where CortEs and the conquistadors landed. We see the buildings of the central city - city hall and the cathedral - while our off-screen narrator provides a history lesson about hurricanes, pirates, and various armies wrecking havoc upon the city. We next see traditional and modern suburbs, again with the emphasis on their Spanish style. Outside the Hotel Macambo, a crowd watches dancers perform the bow dance; then it's on to Macambo Beach where professional fishermen throw huge nets and where sports fishing is popular.
