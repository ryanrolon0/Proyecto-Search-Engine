Rock and Roll Mud Wrestling

 In the early seventies Mick O'Brien represented Australia in boxing at the Munich Olympics. Then in the eighties, after retiring from professional boxing, he became a fight promoter, holding state boxing tournament in pubs around Perth. When pub boxing was banned in the late eighties, Mick started something few this side of the world had seen before, and he called it; Rock and Roll Mud Wrestling. Join Mick, his wife Shirly and rag tag mix of barmaids, strippers and ex jailbirds as they take their racy show on the road and travel up the West Coast of Australia playing to sold out audiences across the state.
