Repressed

 Mike Angstrom spent his life running from memories that seemed to come from nowhere. After undergoing Hypnosis to explore the depths of his past, he finds he was used against his will in ritualistic ceremonies as a child. The more he runs, the more the memories chase him down and he is faced with the ultimate horror in his life... his own destiny. Driven by the need to separate from his past, Mike fights his way further and further from his repressed past; but with each step he takes to get away, he is drawn closer to the truth.
