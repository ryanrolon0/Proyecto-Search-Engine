Purpose

 Ethan (Ben Nisman) is left emotionally scarred when the last of his kin, his sister Kat, is brutally murdered and left in an alley near their apartment. With no family, no job, and nothing left to live for, he searches for the men responsible for Kats death, only to discover that the story goes deeper than he imagined.
