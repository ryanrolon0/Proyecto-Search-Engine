Sigh

 Sy is a lonely man who works as a stock boy in a supermarket. He is lamenting to Al the butcher how he can't get girls to like him. Just then, he spots Maggie, a shopper in the market, who seems to be attracted to him as he is to her. The two go on an unusual and somewhat culturally nostalgic courting ritual through the aisles of the supermarket. In the end, will Sy finally get the girl?
