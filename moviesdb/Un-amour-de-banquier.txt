Un amour de banquier

 Anthony Wayne goes to Paris. He's going to work there as a bank- employee. He has got 30 days off to orientate himself and to find himself a house. He falls in love with Nicole Chantelle (she doesn't know that) and becomes her maid, which means that he has to look after the spoiled Marie, Nicole's daughter. He's the first who can handle her, and he really enjoys being maid. Then it appears that Nicole is his future colleague at the bank...
