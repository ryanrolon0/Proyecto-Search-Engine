The Care Taker

 A gypsy woman passes away. In her inheritance she has left the caretaker of her home a parrot and a puppet. Every morning, afternoon, and evening the caretaker taunts the parrot and verbally abuses the puppet. Until one day, things begin to change. The puppet comes to life and on the eve of Halloween the puppet decides to give the ruthless caretaker a night he will never forget.
