The Troublesome Collar

 A typical scene depicting a youth in a mad endeavor to adjust a collar that is evidently one size too small for his shirt. He is clad in a dress suit and judging from the pained expression on his face, his time is limited. His frantic efforts to button the collar in its place are laughable to say the least. His facial expressions are great, and the picture is full of mirth from beginning to end.
