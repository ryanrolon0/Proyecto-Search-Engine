Repeat After Me

 Repeat After Me is the story of two such unsuspecting twenty-somethings, who literally invade each-others brains through the intervention of a meteorological act of fate. Anybody who asserts that two heads are better than one should be water-boarded into sanity, just imagine having your social pariah of a house-mate's words in your mouth constantly. Andrew and Greg have accidentally hijacked each others tongues, which is, as it turns out, not nearly as fun as one would guess. The worst case scenarios invariably happen, and as they struggle to lead their daily lives as 'brain twins', every word is a potential disaster.
