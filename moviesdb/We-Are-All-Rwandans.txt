We Are All Rwandans

 'We Are All Rwandans' is at once uniquely Rwandan and completely global inspiring and devastating true story about the ability of the apparently powerless to powerfully change their world. In 1997, three years after the Rwandan genocide officially ended in 1994, a small boarding school in Western Rwanda was attacked by rebels. Defenseless and alone, the teenage students were told to separate Hutu from Tutsi by the extremist Hutu rebels in order that the Tutsis could be slaughtered of rebellion to the new post-genocide government. At gunpoint, the students refused to separate.
