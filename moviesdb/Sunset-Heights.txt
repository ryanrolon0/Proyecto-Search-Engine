Sunset Heights

 Set sometime in the near future in an Ireland free of British rule, two ruling gangs come together over the abduction and death of several small boys. The most recent occurrence, the drowning of Luke Bradley's son, seems to point to a man known as The Preacher. Once his guilt is decided, the gangs offer Bradley the chance to take his revenge, and kill The Preacher.
