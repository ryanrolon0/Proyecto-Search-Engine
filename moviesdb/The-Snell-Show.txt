The Snell Show

 The Hunsaker family arrive late for the community gathering at the Snells' trailer. Once everyone is settled, the crowd chants a countdown and Snell detonates a homemade atomic device in the valley below. The onlookers enjoy the thrill and spectacle of the blast. When everyone has gone home, Snell contemplates the scene, while his wife collects the trash.
