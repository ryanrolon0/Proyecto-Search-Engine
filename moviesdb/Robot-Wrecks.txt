Robot Wrecks

 While visiting Black's Department Store, the Our Gang observe "Volto" a publicity robot in the appliance department. Unaware that the robot is actually an actor in a costume, the Our Gang resolve to build one of their own. The neighborhood bully takes advantage of the gang's ignorance and sells them a box of "invisible rays" to fuel the gang's creation. Actually, neighborhood tough guy "Boxcar" climbs inside to animate the robot. He runs amok, using the lawn mower to destroy flower and vegetable gardens.
