The Voyeur

 The passion is gone from Brenda and James's ten-year marriage; he's into his corporate law career and she's a successful businesswoman, but she'd like the magic back. She takes the advice of her European aunt Lydia, and she books a weekend getaway at a Napa County resort. It takes her awhile, but she finally gets James to stop thinking about business. She asks him if he's had any fantasies, and he admits to thinking about watching her with a lover, so on the second night of their stay, she arranges for him to hide behind a mirror in the room while she goes in search of the inn's recreation director. Will it bring fire to their marriage, and what about her fantasy?
