Une fille sur la route

 Star singer Carlos Cortez is fed up with his idol status. All he wants is to be able to breathe and escape his hysterical female admirers. So, one day, he hits the road and when a pretty hitch-hiker asks him for a lift he picks her up. The young person does not recognize him, which is a delight. Annabel is a fan of camping and she invites Jacques Gary (Carlos Cortez's real name) to follow her and share the life of campers. Carlos/Jacques wholeheartedly accepts.
