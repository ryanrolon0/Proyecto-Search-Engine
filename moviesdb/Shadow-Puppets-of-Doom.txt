Shadow Puppets of Doom

 Horror and comedy meet in an unholy union when a bureaucratic mistake forces Sarah, a high school physics teacher, into a job at the B.F. Skinner Kindergarten for the Gifted. With her class of five-year-olds in open rebellion, Sarah begs the heartless principal, Mr. Vealfont, to transfer her back to her high school. When he refuses, Sarah, desperate to subdue her manic children and secure her release, turns to a mysterious old book she finds in her classroom that teaches her to make shadow puppets. But when the children push her too far and Sarah's shadow puppets take on a life of their own, the school is treated to a shadow-puppet show of monstrous proportions!
