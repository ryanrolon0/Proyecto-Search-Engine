Seven Green Bottles

 Seven wayward juveniles (the "Green Bottles" of the title) spend their days truanting and thieving. One by one they are caught and made to face the consequences of the choices they have made. An educational film apparently made in association with the Metropolitan Police and intended to be shown in schools as a warning to those who might be tempted to stray from the straight and narrow. Included as an extra on the DVD for Bronco Bullfrog (1971).
