The Pinecrest Diaries

 Pinecrest Elementary School is located in a low income area of Ottawa which contains the largest number of immigrants in the city. Faced with under-funding and a high needs community, Pinecrest's reputation for poor academics and bad behavior has closure threatening the school. The Pinecrest Diaries follows their new principal, Charles Austen, his inspirational vision, three boys, their community and a story of how the school and its students have begun an amazing turnaround.
