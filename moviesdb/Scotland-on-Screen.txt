Scotland on Screen

 A documentary exploring the various ways that Scotland has been portrayed on screen. From the Hollywood tartanry of _Brigadoon (1954)_ (qv) and _Bonnie Prince Charlie (1948)_ (qv) to the harsh reality of _Trainspotting (1996)_ (qv). 'Alan Cumming' (qv), who despite his more recent Hollywood credentials was born in the Highlands, tours the locations used in various films. Meeting people who live there and asking how the films compare with their reality, talking to film-makers and academics. Some merging of scenes from the films with the footage shot for the documentary gives a "then & now" comparison and even appears to put Alan into scenes from the films he's talking about.
