The Raven

 Based on Maria Smith's original published short story, 'The Last Passenger', nurse Ligeia Roget is relieved her Halloween shift is over. The one night, when the gap between this world and the next becomes very thin. Boarding her lone train journey home, confused and dazed is she imagining the lifeless Raven in the aisle? What about the man dressed in black? Is he the guard or the crow man? Is the blood from a victim? Is she the next? Fear intensifies as Gemma Crabtree playing Ligeia attempts to escape The Raven.
