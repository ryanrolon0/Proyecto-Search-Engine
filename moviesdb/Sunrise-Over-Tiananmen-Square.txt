Sunrise Over Tiananmen Square

 This film illustrates the life of the film director, Shui-Bo Wang in The People's Republic of China. We learn of the life of the director in his own words and images from a child steeped in the values of Chinese communism exemplified by Chairman Mao, to a young man striving to live up to those ideals both as an artist and a soldier. We also learn of his disillusionment with Chinese society and those same ideals, culminating in the horror of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Sunrise Over Tiananmen Square is a visual autobiography of an artist who grew up in China during the historic upheavals of the '60s, '70s and '80s. Through a rich collage of original artwork and family and archival photographs, Shui-Bo Wang offers a personal perspective on the turbulent Cultural Revolution and the years that followed.
