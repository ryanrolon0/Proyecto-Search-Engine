Sonic the Hedgehog 2

 Sonic The Hedgehog returns! And where there's Sonic, there's Robotnik. This time, Robotnik is planning a world takeover while trapping animals in capsules or turning them into robots. With his new pal Miles "Tails" Prower The Fox and the ability to "Spin-Dash", Sonic must find the 7 Chaos Emeralds (yup, there's one more) and stop Robotnik once again!
