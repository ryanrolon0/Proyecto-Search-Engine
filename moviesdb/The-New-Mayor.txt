The New Mayor

 When Mayor Stephen Juba of Winnipeg unexpectedly resigned after twenty-one years, the race for his office was thrown wide open. The two leading contenders were Bill Norrie and Robert Steen. The film shows Norrie and Steen campaigning; then focuses on the winner, Steen, and his assumption of a position that had been held by one person for two decades. The New Mayor is a study of big-city politics, the function of the mayor in that city, and the personal qualities Steen brought to the job.
