Speaking of Animals No. Y7-1

 A slightly different "Speaking of Animals" short in that there are actual humans on screen rather than just animals. The always-befuddled Sterling Holloway inherits a mangy mongrel with a fiendish sense of humor; the dog can talk but will only do so when Sterling is alone. (The premise of several other films, at least one great cartoon from Warners, and several dirty and/or hairy dog jokes.) Sterling ends up on a psychiatrist's couch.
