The Samurai of Strongsville, Ohio

 Suki Hosukawa and her best friend Abigail are average high school sophomores, but in their minds, they are powerful samurai. They keep the ogres and demons at bay, but are powerless against the sneaky ninjas (the popular girls). Suki decides to make a move against the lead Ninja, Melody, only to have Abigail betray her. This leads the two friends to a confrontation over loyalty and honor that will have real world consequences. Meet Suki. She wants to be a samurai, but her dreams of righteous ass kicking are grounded by her real life wussiness. Together with her best friend Abby, she dreams of the day she can walk the school hall with her head held high. But when tryouts for the school fashion show turn both Suki and Abby into victims of the evil machinations of the most ruthless girl in school, Suki has to decide whether to give in, or to stand ground and be the warrior she wishes to become. But will Abby be close behind?
