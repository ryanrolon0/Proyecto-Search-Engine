Under Milk Wood

 This is a delightful if peculiar story of a day in the life of a small, Welsh fishing village called "Llareggub" (read it backwards). We meet a host of curious characters (and ghosts) through the 'eyes' of Blind Captain cat. This is a true "Classic" of modern British writing with a wonderful, mischievous use of language. One night while the townsfolk wrestle with their dreams, seedy Captain Cat and a stranger walk the streets. Captain Cat is a blind, retired sea captain, recalling memories of drowned shipmates and Rosie Probert, a whore and the one great love of his youth.
