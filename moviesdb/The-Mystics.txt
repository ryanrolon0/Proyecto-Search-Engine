The Mystics

 In 1955, in the Southern California community of Long Beach, an inspired group of young people started a magic club. The group soon came to dominate the magic scene. For 30 years the group thrived, and then it disbanded . . . but not before producing some of the most successful names in magic. This is their story. It's the story of the Long Beach Mystics. Interviews, archive footage and performance footage is included.
