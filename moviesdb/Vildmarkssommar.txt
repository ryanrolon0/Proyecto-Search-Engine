Vildmarkssommar

 A mixture of fiction and educational nature document. Somewhere on the northern coast of Norway, 15-year-old Matti sneaks out of a Norwegian fishing boat where he's been hiding all the way from England. Years earlier, during the Second World War, little Matti has been stranded in England together with his sailor father who has later died in an air raid. Matti is determined to find his way back to Finland to find his old home and his younger sister Silkka. He starts his journey through the Arctic wilderness in early spring, goes on all through summer and finally reaches Finland in late autumn. On his way, Matti meets only a few people, most of them conveniently his own age. Matti's difficult journey through Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish Lapland is illustrated with spectacular footage of wildlife, explained to the audience by a narrator.
