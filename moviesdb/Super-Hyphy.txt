Super Hyphy

 Ethan Beck, a young college dropout, loses his job and decides to move in with his brother Danny. Danny is a low-level street dealer of cocaine, and he attempts to recruit Ethan into the "family business". Eventually the "big boss", a drug cartel runner named Francisco Ruiz, offers Danny a promotion to be a mid-level supplier. Danny accepts, but the greater dangers of mid-level distribution began to wear down on both Ethan and Danny, straining the relationships between them and others. Things begin to go downhill when Danny becomes the prime suspect in a murder investigation and a large shipment of drugs goes missing. With nowhere left to go, Ethan chooses a path of revenge and hatred toward the cartel bosses that have now disowned them. With the lives of everyone he cares about at stake, is Ethan able to save himself and the people he cares about from this chaos...?
