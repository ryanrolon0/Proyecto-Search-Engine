Recruiting

 An unexpected proposal for a gay everyman. What is identity, and what is its price? What could be a very low-key pick-up scene soon morphs into a bazaar revelation and proposition. An absurd story that takes the standard right wing notion of the"homosexual agenda" and turns it on its head - but is not far from the truth. BobbyRoger Productions continues its unique and comic exploration of modern social themes with Recruiting. Along with a healthy dose of humor, Recruiting poses some intriguing questions about this moment in America straight culture? When does "out" become "in"? What is lost along the way? At a time when the mass culture is presented with the sexless, feel-good scenarios of Will & Grace and Queer Eye, Recruiting serves as a reminder that critical questions of identity and assimilation are still far from being resolved.
