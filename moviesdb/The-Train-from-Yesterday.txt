The Train from Yesterday

 'The Train from Yesterday' is a collision of two worlds. Set in a small western town in 1914, the film throws us into the lives of a devious journalist and a disillusioned priest. The priest, unsure of God's will and the men who claim it, must fulfill the last wish of an old friend and dying cowboy; kill him by the gun before he withers away in his bed. The journalist, run out of Chicago by a crooked politician, happens upon the killing. In the context of the changing landscape of America and at the feet of the last cowboy's dead body, the two men fight a battle of wits, nerve, and belief to survive this violent encounter.
