 Timi wants to become a pop star, but her boyfriend Brando is not delighted by the idea, and when she is discovered by the famous rock'n'roll star and manager Miklós Fenyõ, she has to deal with the possibility of losing him and with the difficulties of newly found stardom. The story of her career is based on the life of Hungary's first teen star Szandi, with a romantic twist added to make the story more interesting. The soundtrack, which is also Szandi's third album, was composed by Miklós Fenyõ, one of the most famous singers of Hungary during the 60s and 70s.
