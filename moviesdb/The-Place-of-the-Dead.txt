The Place of the Dead

 A group of soldiers on a British Army expedition attempt to navigate an unexplored Malaysian gully. So inaccessible is the area, that they must ascend the highest mountain in Southeast Asia just to reach the entrance. The initial climb proves to be difficult for some of the party. Against strong objections, they are allowed to catch up and rest, rather than being turned back. Things don't improve the next day, however. With rations going more quickly than expected and time running out, a decision must be made. Should the lead group wait even longer and risk the entire mission, or save time by scouting the location ahead of them? Descending over "The Point Of No Return" could split the team permanently. Who makes the call?
