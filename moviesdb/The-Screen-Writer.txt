The Screen Writer

 This short focuses on the job of the screenwriter, who adapts a story into a screenplay. It is his screenplay that is transformed into the movie we see at theaters. An original story may come from literary agents or studio story editors. Novels and plays also provide story ideas. Some screenwriters became directors and producers. Others even became studio production heads such as 'Darryl F. Zanuck' (qv) and 'Dore Schary' (qv).
