The Mighty Misfit Kids

 The setting is 1935, smack in the heart of the Great Depression, where parents who could no longer take care of their children, set them off on 'Orphan Trains', to be adopted by families in the Midwest in hope of a better life. This is the story of one of the last orphan train rides, and the saga of five free spirited children from distinct backgrounds, whose lot in life would not prevent them from finding the true meaning of happiness, friendship and the life they dreamed of. A journey taking them on a wild ride, leading to a magical search for lost buried treasure in an old haunted house. This is their remarkable story of hope and perseverance. These are the Mighty Misfit Kids.
