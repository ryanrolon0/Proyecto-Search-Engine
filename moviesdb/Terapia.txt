Terapia

 Lucis is a patient who wants to be discharged. Ana, her psychiatrist, does no want to discharge her. But Anna will receive a cell call that will change her life radically during that therapy session. Ana and Lucia will engage in a psychic duel where shameful secrets, the pain, and the lies will come to light. What Ana does not expect is that, through her patient, she will learn to accept bad things life brings. During that session, they will interchange their roles. When the treatment is over, neither Ana nor Lucia will be the same. Something will have changed forever in their minds.
