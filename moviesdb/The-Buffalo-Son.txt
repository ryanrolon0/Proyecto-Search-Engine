The Buffalo Son

 'The Buffalo Son' chronicles the adventures of Peter Apple, a teenage boy who awakes in the middle of an Arizona desert road with complete head trauma-induced amnesia. With no family, proof of birth, or social security number, the sweet, naive Peter gains relative national fame for his story and spontaneous poetry. But he is eventually adopted as a prophet and 'flawless judge of this World' by the strange beat poets and art fiends in his foster family's neighborhood. Peter slowly morphs into a cocky, careless, rockstar-like hero while becoming a target of jealousy and hatred at his high school. As his memory begins to return, Peter begins to question the roles he has been assigned in this colorful, funny and eerie take on the American dream.
