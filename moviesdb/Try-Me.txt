Try Me

 After 5 years of marriage, Evan (Jefferson Brown) and Amanda's (Neale Kimmel) wedlock has become a deadlock. Evan wants to move onto the next stage and have children, but Amanda doesn't believe he's ready. In an attempt to reach a solution, they visit a new age marriage councilor, whose unorthodox form of therapy yields startling results. The next morning they wake up on the wrong side of the bed...in each other's bodies. Committed to engagements with their neighbors, Evan and Amanda are forced to go about their day, seeing the world through each other's eyes.
