Wadimbisa

 A young man graduates from technical college and wishes to establish himself as a carpenter in his native village. When he finds it impossible to earn any money there, he emigrates to the city, where an uncle gives him sound advice on setting up his own business as a cabinetmaker. His uncle teaches him that despite his qualifications, he must think pragmatically and stay in touch with reality. He must make serviceable, well-made products such as furniture and not get it into his head to produce arty knick-knacks that nobody will ever buy. Time and care, order and maintenance are the utmost importance. Once the young man achieves financial stability through the practice of his trade, he marries the daughter of a progressive, westernized chief.
