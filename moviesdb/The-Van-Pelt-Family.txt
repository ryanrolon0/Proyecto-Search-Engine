The Van Pelt Family

 Freeman Jenkins, a black man, hopes to marry his white girlfriend Starla Van Pelt. Before doing so, the always well-mannered Freeman is intent on meeting Starla's family and obtaining her father's permission. Freeman prepares himself for the worst, or so he believes, anticipating a "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" scenario. However, just the opposite is in store. Starla's father has adopted a black persona and moved the Van Pelt family into an urban ghetto to "get down with the cause." Will Freeman be able to convince this white family-consisting of a tie-dye wearing Rastafarian, a shamelessly racist and sex-crazed grandma, and an 11-year-old Huey Newton-wannabe-that he is "black enough" for Starla?
