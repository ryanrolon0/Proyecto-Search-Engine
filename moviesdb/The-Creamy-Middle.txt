The Creamy Middle

 Best Friends Nikko and Josh have one month to produce a play. Businessman, Austin Cronklehogan, trying to win back the affections of Vanessa, his lost love, has invested in Josh and Nikko's 'Vison' of a play about his undying love for her. For Director and Promoter, Josh and Nikko this is the opportunity of a lifetime, it's too bad they're idiots.
