Sadie's Waltz

 Sadie's Waltz is a haunting story of grief and transcendence. A young woman trapped in a home destroyed by tragedy suffers her father's tyrannical abuse until a strange vision inspired by a comic book advertisement shows her an unexpected path to liberation. Sadie's Waltz boldly dramatizes the subconscious in a film where the rational and the irrational collide in a struggle for the survival of a human soul.
