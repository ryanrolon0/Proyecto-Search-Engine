This Is a Life?

 Parody of "This is Your Life," with Elmer Fudd as the host and Bugs Bunny as the guest of honor, much to the disgust of Daffy Duck. On several occassions, Granny has to whack Daffy over the head to get him to be quiet. Meanwhile, Bugs reminisces with Elmer and Yosemite Sam about their previous encounters (reviewed via footage from past Bugs Bunny cartoons). Elmer and Sam plan to present Bugs with a special gift (a time bomb) in appreciation of their "friendship," but Daffy (still believing he was meant to be the guest) grabs the gift and takes the resulting explosion.
