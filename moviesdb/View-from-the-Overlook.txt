 In 1966, Stanley Kubrick mused to a friend about his desire to make "the world's scariest movie." In 1980, he did it. This documentary tells the story behind the making of Kubrick's rich tale of psychological horror and supernatural evil. It also explores why the film stands the test of time, counting among its admirers Steven Spielberg, who professes to having watched it at least two dozen times. Through interviews with current filmmakers, we examine why The Shining continues to dazzle and terrify audiences, more than two decades after its release.
