Porky's Poor Fish

 Porky Pig owns a fish store and goes out to lunch. After a cat is not having much success with a mouse, he goes into the fish store when Porky is away. When the cat thinks he has the good appetite, the fish go to war against him and drive him out of the store. He is then freaked out by the mouse and shrinks as the mouse grows.
