The College Spendthrift

 He was the only son of his mother and she was a widow." The boy was the apple of his mother's eye, and mother-like she had lavished on him the majority of the meager resources at her command, and has gone to the extent of mortgaging her home to pay the boy's expenses through college. He is thoughtless and in no measure appreciates her struggle and the sacrifices she is making for him. He is a " prince of good fellows" and squanders the money she is scraping for in riotous living. After graduation, he needs more money to enable him to take a position offered him in the west. The home being mortgaged to its limit, the widow raises the necessary funds by realizing on what jewelry she has left and thus equipped, he goes west, promising his mother as he says goodbye, that he will write often. In new scenes and with new interests, he soon forgets his promise, and the loving, praying mother at home is only an occasional memory. The mother, at home, alone, struggles for a year, is turned out of her home and as other years go past, becomes poorer and poorer and, after many heart rending struggles, finally ends in the poor house. Meanwhile, the son, having prospered greatly in the west, one day comes across a photo of his mother and is brought to a startling realization of his badness. Filled with remorse for his conduct, he starts east and commences a search for his mother. After many failures and much suffering of mind, he finds and rescues her from the poor house, and the two of them start for the new home in the west, never to part again.
