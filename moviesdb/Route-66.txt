Route 66

 Three German provincials are searching for hollywood. So they take the most American values, they can picture bottles of oil and camera equipment on the way to California via Route 66. That they never find Hollywood is not the only surprise - on their quest for the American cliches they face unplanned incidents. A documentary drama somewhere between Jackass and Michael Moore, between gloating and satire.
