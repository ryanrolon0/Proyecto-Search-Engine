The Pig's Curly Tail

 Two pigs steal the snobby Mrs. Hippo's new Ford and, while being pursued by the police, they hit a stone wall, fly into the air and land in a laundry. They get involved with a clothes-wringer, their tails are caught in the rollers, and they come out with corkscrew tails. In the live action, animator Walter Lantz, as he finishes the story, is being led away by the keeper of the local insane asylum.
