Rich in Love

 The life of a teenager, in her last year of high school in Charleston, South Carolina, is upended when her mother leaves her father and cuts all contact with her family. Things get even more complicated when her older sister shows up with a new husband and a pregnancy she's bitter and ambivalent about, and moves back in. They all spend the rest of the summer trying to come to grips with their lives.
