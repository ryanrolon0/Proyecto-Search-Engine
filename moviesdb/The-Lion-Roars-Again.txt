The Lion Roars Again

 This short film is a chronicle of the 1975 International Press Conclave hosted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer over two days in May 1975. The event was used to preview several upcoming MGM feature films. After opening remarks by studio vice-president 'Daniel Melnick' (qv), the press gets a tour of a set that will be used in the film _Logan's Run (1976)_ (qv), plus a short fashion show of the film's futuristic costumes. 'Gene Kelly (I)' (qv) and 'Fred Astaire' (qv) host a luncheon honoring _That's Entertainment, Part II (1976)_ (qv). Next is a press conference for a film with the working title "The All-American Girl" (the film was eventually released under the title _Sweet Revenge (1976)_ (qv). The first day ends with a dinner for the stars of _Sunshine Boys, The (1975)_ (qv). 'Richard Benjamin' (qv), host of the dinner, is surprised by the presentation of a birthday cake. 'George Burns' (qv) and 'Walter Matthau' (qv) also address the diners. The second day begins with a press conference for _Hearts of the West (1975)_ (qv). This is followed by a special premiere of _Wind and the Lion, The (1975)_ (qv). The conclave concludes with a dinner and ball on a sound stage made to look like the Moroccan desert depicted in the film.
