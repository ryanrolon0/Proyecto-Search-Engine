The 70% Club

 The 70% club is drama comedy that is as profoundly timely as it is hilariously humorous and brutally honest. It focuses on relationships, and more specifically, addresses an article recently published by the New York Times based on census data reporting that 45% of White women, 51% of Hispanic women and 70% of Black women are without a spouse. The play explores this phenomenon by telling the story of a group of friends preparing for the wedding of one couple, Deanna and Jackson.
