Ragazzo rosso

 Somewhere near Liege, the day when Le Standard could win the Belgian soccer championship, on the eve of the demonstration against the delocalization of his factory, the young Italian Belgian worker Antonio leaves for Italy to work with his uncle... But he must still tell to Gino, his union representative who is also his father... Padre padrone ? Make or Brake ?
