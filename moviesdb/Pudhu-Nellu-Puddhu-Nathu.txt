Pudhu Nellu Puddhu Nathu

 An old widow returns to a small Tamil Nadu village with her two sons. The elder son is an illiterate peasant, the younger an educated, urbane youth, who falls in love with an iron-fisted local landlord's daughter. The landlord is unsettled at his daughter's fancy for the peasant's son, who meanwhile has just discovered an inconvenient tidbit about his beloved's father.
