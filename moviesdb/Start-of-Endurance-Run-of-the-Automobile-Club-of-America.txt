Start of Endurance Run of the Automobile Club of America

 A highly interesting automobile picture, showing about one hundred automobiles of various types starting on their endurance run from New York to Boston and return. The scene is laid in front of the club house of the Automobile Club of America. The machines start away in rapid succession, so there is no break whatever in the action of the film, and the attention of the audience is held from start to finish.
