The Metaphysics of Buster Keaton

 America's great film director-actor Buster Keaton, discussed by film critic Andrew Sarris and Raymond Rohauer, cinema historian, with some unusual perspectives on his goals and motivations. Illustrated with many film excerpts from 1917 to 1928. Rohauer knew Keaton and was partly responsible from rescuing many of his old films from destruction. Sarris is a leading film critic who has often written about Keaton. Excerpts include portions of "The General" (1926) a film illustrating "man versus machine." "Cops" (1922), which questions the meaning of "law and order." "Frozen North", a satire on William Hart films, and "The Boat" in which Keaton goes down but then wades to shore. In "Sherlock, Jr." Keaton is a film projectionist who in dream enters the movie. "College" (1927) spoofs the happy ending, "Steamboat Bill, Jr." mocks the cyclone that destroys everything in its path. Rohauer describes rescuing Keaton's films from a garage and talking with Keaton at the end of his life when he had been forgotten.
