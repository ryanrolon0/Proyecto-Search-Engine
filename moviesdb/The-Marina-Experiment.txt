The Marina Experiment

 A father documents the emotional violations his daughter endured under his direction, throughout the first 16 years of her life. After his death, she uncovers boxes of reel-to-reel audiotape, super 8 films, and over 10,000 photographs, all of her. The daughter, who is also the filmmaker, presents this evidence in a subtle intellectual investigation that is grotesquely truthful and forthrightly condemning.
