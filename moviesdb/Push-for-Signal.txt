Push for Signal

 A solitary pedestrian stops at a traffic light and pushes the "push for signal" button a couple of times. It's on a pole on the edge of the crosswalk. The light doesn't change. He peers down the street to his right and his left into fog, looking for traffic. He decides to cross. He makes it to the other side without incident and realizes he's dropped his keys. He sees them on the far side of the street. The light is still red against him, and a snarl of traffic is headed his way. What should he do?
