Saturday Nightmares

 Stever gets up close and personal with many of the talented filmmakers and stars in exclusive backstage interviews. Stever captures the set-up of the memorabilia and collectibles stands by the hard-working staff and volunteers, the panel discussion with Romero, Barbeau and others moderated by Roy Frumkes, and the long lines of fans, some adorned in full costume and make-up, waiting to get autographs of their favorite horror legends. This unprecedented Saturday Nightmares event brings together the entire George A Romero family! New York City actor turned filmmaker Michael Stever takes you behind the scenes and shows you virtually every, thrilling, blood-soaked moment in this not-to-be-missed DVD!
