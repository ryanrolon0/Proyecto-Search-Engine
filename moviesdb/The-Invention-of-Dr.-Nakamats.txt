The Invention of Dr. Nakamats

 The film is about the utterly fantastic and eccentric 80-year-old Japanese inventor responsible for 3,357 inventions, including the floppy disk. NakaMats is an unlikely character made for the movies, with his deadpan English and impeccable comic timing providing nonstop laughs. About his Love Jet potion, he says I'm not doing the sex. I'm checking meters." At a conference, he leads a sing-along of a ditty he penned to memorialize the seven hours of snow shoveling he once did to get to a university class. Utterly nutty, but also a paean to the spirit of human invention. "The brain reaches maximum activity 0.5 seconds before death, then I can suddenly create a breakthrough!" So says Dr Nakamatsu, a Japanese Willy Wonka of random invention, regularly starving his brain of oxygen underwater to get new ideas. Eccentric to say the least, he sleeps four hours a day, eats only one meal, chooses his cameras by smell and has close to three and a half thousand patents under his belt, including the floppy disk. With more inventions than Thomas Edison and a serious belief that he will live to the ripe old age of 144, Dr Nakamatsu makes for one of the most interesting subjects of a documentary imaginable. Danish filmmaker Kaspar Astrup Schröder goes down the rabbit hole with Nakamatsu and finds an odd world of gadgets and gizmos where the inventor is king.
