Sewer Chewer

 Sewer Chewer is a tribute to the creature features of the 70's and 80's drive in movies. A space satellite falls to earth and lands in a rural area, radiating the local wildlife into a mutant monster that has a large appetite for humans. An unnamed government agency sends a special agent out to dispose of the satellite and the mutant and any who know of it.
