She needs both the item and the pilots flying skills, for her sinister plan to steal the largest Sapphire in the world - the legendary Star of India. A holy item to the people of India. But Malice Raven hasn't thought of the pilots son, gung-ho teenager Jim. While the authorities don't believe in the kidnapping, Jim doesn't think twice about rescuing his father. With the aid of his English Boy Scout friend Spencer, the two kids are in hot pursuit for Malice Raven. The chase for the The Star of India takes Jim from the dark sides of Bombay, on board a steam train, underwater grotto, deep into the forbidden zone of a far away Maharaja Kingdom.
