Three Weekends in June

 Before the bride Jade can enjoy the nuptials to her man, Carl, she must first get through two other June events with her whacked but lovable family. Each member has made it their mission to make an appearance in their own 'special' way. There's cousins Ricardo; Peachy and Punkin'; 'extra' animated Ebonica with her play sister, Ce Ce. Then there's Cu'din Junior, inquisitive Aunt Evangeline and her sidekick Gertrude. What about the children you ask? Well, they're in there, too. And let's not forget cousins Jasper, his wife Kim, and ex-football player, Tiny and his football player girlfriend. Last but not least, there's Uncle Rufus, Mr. Smooth himself. Will Jade make it through those Three Weekends in June?
