Red River Valley

 Ranchers, with the help of Roy, raise money to build a reservoir but lose it to a gambler through a crooked stock deal. Songs include the title song, "Love Begins at Sunset on the Trail," "Lily of the Hillbilly Valley," "When Payday Rolls Around," and "Chant of the Wanderer." To bring water to their valley, ranchers have raised money to build a dam. When that money is stolen, Allison suggests the ranchers sell their stock to a friend of his thereby getting the money needed to complete the dam. Roy has a clue that Allison was involved in the robbery and is out to get control of the valley. So Roy and the boys try to delay the sale of the stock while they look for proof against Allison.
