We Shall Not Be Moved

 We Shall Not Be Moved movement in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The project was part the the annual History Makers award given by the Chattanooga History Center honoring those students who participated in the movement. Their first hand accounts bring to life the dangers and fears they endured to bring about change in their own community and our country.
