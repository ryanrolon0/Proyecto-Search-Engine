Song for Marion

 "Song For Marion", a London-set comedic drama, is about shy, grumpy 72-year old Arthur who gets more than he bargains for when he joins an unconventional choir. At odds with his son James and trying to resist the charms of choir director Elizabeth, Arthur is a reluctant late bloomer who learns to love life again.
