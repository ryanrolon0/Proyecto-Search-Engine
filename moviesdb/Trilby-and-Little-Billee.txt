Trilby and Little Billee

 "This is the studio scene from Du Maurier's celebrated novel 'Trilby,' in which Trilby is introduced sitting on a table, munching a cake and talking to Little Billee, who is seated near by, his elbow resting on the table. Smoking, kissing and laughing make a lively scene."
