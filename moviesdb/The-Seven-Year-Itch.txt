The Seven Year Itch

 Like many other Manhattan husbands, Richard Sherman sends his wife and son to the country for the summer, while he stays behind to toil. Though reveling in temporary bachelor freedom of lifestyle, he's resolved not to carouse and philander like some others. But his overactive, over-vivid imagination goes into overdrive when a delightfully unconventional, voluptuous blonde moves in upstairs. In summertime in Manhattan, the plain and average Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) sends his wife and son for vacation in the country. Sherman is the key man of a publishing firm, Brady & Company, which publishes cheap pocket books. The faithful Sherman has a routine life with his family and dreams on being successful with women. When a beautiful and sexy blonde lodges the upstairs apartment of his small building, Sherman first opens the front door for her and then he invites her to have a drink with him after the fall of her tomato vase on his chair. Along the days, he spends some time with the girl and feels tempted by her, but later he misses his family and travels to meet them. A professional book reader for a publishing company must endure the dog days of a New York summer alone while his wife and son find themselves on a oceanside resort without a paddle. To pass the lonely hours, the overly-imaginative book reader fantasizes about a young model who is lodging temporarily in the apartment upstairs.
