Remember a Day

 REMEMBER A DAY is a film narrating the acid excesses of a late Sixties rock star - turned - recluse ROGER BANNERMAN, a man 'going far further than you ever could imagine', a character not unlike PINK FLOYD founder SYD BARRETT. Despite having effectively retired, BANNERMAN is being stalked by an unhinged fan who's determined to 're-launch' Roger no matter what it takes, no matter how many laws are broken... Laced with black humor, drugs, psychedelic imagery, groupie sex and featuring a stunning soundtrack - that includes works by the PINK FLOYD, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART and THE EDGAR BROUGHTON BAND. REMEMBER A DAY is an early seventies period piece shot by the people who's story it essentially is.
