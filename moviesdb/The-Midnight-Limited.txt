The Midnight Limited

 A runaway freight train is running wild toward Benbow; the night mail-train is heading in the opposite direction on the same railroad tracks; and The Midnight Limited, carrying 300 men and women passengers, including his sweetheart, is on the parallel track, with all three coming together at the same point. What's a poor dispatcher to do?
