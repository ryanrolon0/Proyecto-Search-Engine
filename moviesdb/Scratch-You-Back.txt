Scratch You Back

 Two brothers meet at a diner for their birthday -- same day, several years apart. Their celebration is routine, a microcosm of the routine that has become Ron's life. When a miracle occurs, Ron finally gets justice with a bitter and biting act of omission. 'Scratch You Back' is a dry and dumpy comedy about one man's resignation and exultation under harsh fluorescence.
