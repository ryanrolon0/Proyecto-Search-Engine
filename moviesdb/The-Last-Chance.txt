The Last Chance

 Bill, apparently a dude, watches an outlaw gang rob the stage. He then joins the gang saying he wants to become an outlaw too. The gang has taken the driver as a hostage and when his daughter comes looking for her missing father, she is made prisoner also. Still posing as a dude, Bill now sets out to free the hostages and bring the gang to justice.
