The Unique Oneness of Christian Savage

 Christian Savage, a twelve-year-old farm boy, spends his childhood years with Nyadze, the son of his mother's Zulu domestic worker. Although they are from different cultures, life is one big adventure for the two best friends as they explore rural Africa. Doubts grow in Christian as he questions the values of his family and church until one day his friend's beliefs are etched in his soul forever.
