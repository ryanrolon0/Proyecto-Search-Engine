The House That Dinky Built

 The House That Jack Built is being renovated by Dinky Doodle and company. Dinky Doodle is a tiny cartoon-schoolboy; his "company" is his cartoon-dog, Weakheart, and his life-size adult friend, a cartoonist. Dinky and Weakheart fall asleep on the job. The cartoonist scolds them. They respond by spraying him with a hose. Finally, they all get to work. The cartoonist slaps mortar on a brick and throws it to Dinky, standing on the roof, who uses it to build a chimney. The life-size brick becomes Dinky-size by the time it gets to him. The cartoonist throws him a rapid succession of bricks, but they come too fast, and an overwhelmed Dinky raises the white flag. The crew piles bags of malt into the house, but a mouse eats them all. The huge malt-filled mouse chases after Dinky and Weakheart, who escape into a picture of a cow. They jump on the cow and ride off. In the world of the picture, Dinky meets a pretty milkmaid. Weakheart finds a parson to marry them. Dinky brings his bride back to the house. Marital strife begins instantly.
