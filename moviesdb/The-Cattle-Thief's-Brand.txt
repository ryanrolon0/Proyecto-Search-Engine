The Cattle Thief's Brand

 George Mason, part owner of a small ranch in Wyoming, rustles cattle, a practice unknown to the employees, with the exception of Jack Beeman, the foreman. Jack is given a message for George Mason, which he delivers. Mason reads it and throws it down on the ground, which is picked up by his wife, who is shocked at reading slow, Bill." George Mason, finding an unbranded calf, brands it. His wife sees this and is satisfied he is a thief. When he returns, she liberates the calf, forgetting that it will seek its mother. Mrs. Mason accuses her husband and tells him what she has done. He then hurries to tell his partner. The wife tells Jack Beeman her story. Jack tells her the ranger must not see the calf, and starts out to re-brand the calf when he is caught in the act by the ranger. Jack immediately fells him and informs Mason's wife what he has done. Meanwhile, Mason and his partner quarrel, and events take a turn for the worse when Jack is imprisoned.
