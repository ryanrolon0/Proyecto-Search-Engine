Tocar La Gorda

 The Biggest Lottery offer more than ever full of money and 24 hours with the big, beautiful, sexy and beefy La Gorda. Skinny is a temp clerk who dreams about La Gorda. One day his luck changes and he finds what he is convinced is the winning lottery ticket after customer Toni de Cornella, a foul-mouthed cabbie with road rage drops the ticket by accident in the store where Skinny works. On the day of the drawing, Toni realizes that he lost his ticket and must plot a scheme to win the prize money. Meanwhile, Jeff Sterling, La Gorda's millionaire philanthropist manager and lover, is spending time and money cheating on La Gorda with Skinny Model Chick. La Gorda discovers the cheating and strangles Jeff to death between her thunderous thighs. Skinny wins the lottery, gets La Gorda while Toni carts off a trunk with Jeff's corpse.
