Saba

 Avraham Ezequiel is 92 years old. He was born in Irak, educated in Singapore, then worked as a journalist for the "Palestine Bulletin" after 1929. He now offers his story to his grandson, interspersing it with quotations from Kafka and Robert Frost, readings from holy texts in Arabic, Hebrew and English and patient tending of his olive grove. This film is an unusual man's journal, through which his grandson let his voice be heard.
