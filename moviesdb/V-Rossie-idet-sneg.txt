V Rossie idet sneg

 Eastern European journalist visits Russia for the fist time.By chance he picks up a phone call at his fellow journalist Moscow office and this call sharply and irrevocably changes his life.He travels to a strange and ghostly provincial Russian town which seems to be real but couldn't be found on any road map.He meets there his dreams and fantasies,his love and his final day.By taking the identity of his friend he enters the ultimate adventure of living somebody Else's live and experiencing somebody Else's fate.But a price for that is his own life.
