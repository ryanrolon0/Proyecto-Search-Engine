Vacation Days

 Miss Hinklefink inherits a western ranch and, in order to spend the summer with Professor Owen Townley, she invites students Freddie Trimball, Dodie Rogers, Betty Rogers, Lee Watson and Roy Donne to spend their vacation on the ranch if Townley will help chaperon the kids. Real estate agent Tom Sneed tries to persuade her to send the kids home when desperadoes rob the bank. In the saloon, Sneed;s henchman Charlie mistakes FReddie for a baby-faced killer, who was blamed for a murder actually committed by Sneed, and ranch foreman Big Jim, also working for Sneed, tries to kill Freddie.
