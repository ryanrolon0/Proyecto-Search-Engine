The Archivist

 Angela is a young archivist. After logging stock footage repeatedly for days she beings to wonder how these images of moving people came across her path. While leaving work one day she sees the beautiful Emerson for the time. She is forced to ponder further, do people meet by fate or by the alignment of random events?
