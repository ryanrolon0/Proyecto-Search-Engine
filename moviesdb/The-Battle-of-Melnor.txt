The Battle of Melnor

 The year is 1999. The place is Koreatown, Los Angeles. Fear of the Y2k bug is felt everywhere and tensions are running high. But if there is one person who is oblivious to it all, it's George(Joe Marklin), for his world revolves around defeating the video game "The Battle of Melnor". Unfortunately for George, it's a two-player game, and this means contact with the outside world. George reluctantly enlists his neighbor Mike (David Weisiger) in his endless crusade.
