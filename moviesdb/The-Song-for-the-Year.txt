The Song for the Year

 In 2004-2005 cult Irish musician PIERCE TURNER recorded his 7th studio album in Woodstock and embarked on a unique tour of Ireland, playing people's pianos in their own parlours and front rooms. Colin Murnane's documentary follows the acclaimed Pierce Turner from his homes in Wexford and Manhattan to the Woodstock studio, and to venues as contrasting as The Public Theatre Manhattan and the Headon's parlour in Birr, County Offaly.
