Sengoku burai

 Soldiers Hayatenosuke Sasa and Kagami Yaheiji leave their besieged castle on a secret mission into the enemy camp. Hayatenosuke has left behind his lover, Kano. In the camp, Hayatenosuke is wounded and cared for by Oryo, who falls in love with him. But when Hayatenosuke accidentally kills her father, he flees, with Oryo in pursuit. Subsequently, Hayatenosuke's comrade Yaheiji falls in love with Oryo. Kano, the lover left behind by Hayatenosuke, believes him dead, and becomes involved with another soldier, Jurota. When Jurota defects to the opposing army, he takes Kano with him. A double set of love triangles has developed, wherein each man and each woman loves one and is loved by another. Finally only combat and self-sacrifice can untangle the weave.
