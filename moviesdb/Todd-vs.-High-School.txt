Todd vs. High School

 On "Good Day LA," Gallagher announced that for his latest experiment he was heading back to high school as a student in Pittsburgh in the fall of 2009 for a book and documentary called "Todd vs. High School." Despite being a National Merit Scholar and Mensa level genius, as high school student Gallagher was kicked out of multiple schools and barely graduated because of his low GPA. His goal in going back to high school was to see if he could get a 4.0, succeed athletically, and get along with his teachers and his parents. On an "Inside Edition" feature, Gallagher stated he finished with a 3.8 GPA and was transformed by the experience. A documentary film of Todd's experience is set to be released in the fall of 2010. The film features a number of celebrities including Taylor Swift, Jason Segal, and Sidney Crosby.
