Skyline Revue

 One of the entries of shorts in the Nu-Atlas series that used a vaudeville skit as the premise of a story to weave in and around lots of no-name singers, dancers and novelty acts. What story there is here has Paula Stone as the socialite wife who gives a party while husband Eddy Bruce is going broke. The creditors start to carry out the furniture, but the party goes on just the same.
