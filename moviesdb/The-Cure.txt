The Cure

 Love and hate can sometimes be looked at in the same light since both can make you do unreasonable things. Such is the case for Kristine Watts who longs for something from her past which is unattainable. Now left with only memories of what once was, this shell of a young woman has only one thing left on her mind... Kristine Watts is broken apart, missing her lover; she is not able to overcome her love for him which is lost in the past. She hires a stranger and gives a list of her mistakes with things for him to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end.
