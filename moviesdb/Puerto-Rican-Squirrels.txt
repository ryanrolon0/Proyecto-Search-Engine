Puerto Rican Squirrels

 Liza's older brother, Alex, is awful to her. Always has been. But it doesn't stop her from wanting to know what he does with his days. This hot August afternoon, she steers her dog, Pansy, to the nearby hills where he and his friends hang out. She hides herself and hunkers down, eavesdropping in hopes of a little diary fodder to last her until school starts again. But Pansy has bigger plans for Liza this time. When the dog bolts into the middle of the group, Liza finds the spotlight has shifted, and it's her turn to reveal something of herself to the older kids.
