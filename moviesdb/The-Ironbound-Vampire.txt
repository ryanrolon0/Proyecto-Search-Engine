The Ironbound Vampire

 A World War I U.S. soldier is cursed by a vampire and when he returns home to his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, he tries to stay alive by his daily consummation for blood. Nearly 80 years later, a dogged police detective, seeking material to write a book about vampires, teams up with a local journalist. They try to find this mysterious person whom the press has dubbed 'the Ironbound Vampire' due to his M.O. of leaving murder victims dry of blood.
