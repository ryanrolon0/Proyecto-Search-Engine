Toys in the Attic

 Sisters Carrie and Anna Berniers have been supporting their ne'er-do-well brother Julian through various failed businesses; now, he returns home with a sudden fortune and his young bride. Jealousies both old and new will play a part as the sisters try to understand what Julian's been up to, and as his wife wonders if there's another woman involved.
