Robert on His Lunch Break

 Robert is a bookish, somewhat withdrawn entry-level office clerk waiting for a to-go order of food. While getting a breath of fresh air and staring into space, he's accosted by Bradley, an earless head with eyes like drains who begins to berate him--perhaps telepathically--with petty insults disguised as good advice.
