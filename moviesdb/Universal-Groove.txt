Universal Groove

 Universal Groove is a step into the underground party scene, through the eyes of a once party strong addict. A wonderful culmination of sights, sounds and narrative are used to tell the story of Jim, a director struggling to understand the human connections that exist in a crowd of strangers... Over the course of one night Jim meets and connects with people in different walks of life, all while discovering the meaning of being part of the human tribe. Universal Groove is an opportunity to step in the pre millennium underground party scene through the eyes of eight people who all tap into the Universal Groove-that moment when the party connects everyone to each other. Each character starts the night with a personal mission, but all leave the party slightly changed by their human interactions. The film uses the after hours backdrop to draw eight characters together at one event--GROOVE. Each of the eight characters is pulled through a night of inspiration and escape through drugs through the release of all manner of frustration. Jim the director is struggling with writer's block; Eve the painter needs inspiration; Beamer, the stockbroker needs to get away from a hard day; Gina the party fixture, needs human contact; Zed the waiter needs a reason to let go of his pain; Candy and Kane the party girls are ready to go on a moments notice; and Push the dealer is there to help them all along their way.
