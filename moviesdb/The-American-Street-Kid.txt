The American Street Kid

 Every minute in America, 1 kid will run away. Every day, 13 of those same kids will die on our streets. At this very moment there are almost 2 million kids living on our streets in America...650,000 of which, are under the age of 15. Spare Some Change is a documentary film that explores the crisis of homeless kids in America and focuses on what we, as individuals, can do to help.
