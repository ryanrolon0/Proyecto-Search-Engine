Unternehmen Arschmaschine

 Rumblings from the factory cellar. The cell splits. The virtual salon opens its nether regions. Two obsessive and (deriving from the principle of symmetry) very similar women scientists investigate the various stages of evolutionary development. And this all without screwing. Drawn by the scientific linguistic system, they become enmeshed in the anal circuit. They approach the black hole and switch on a paraphysical machine. The prototype will bear the name "Omega" (Mara Mattuschka)
