Twilight on the Rio Grande

 In yet another version of probably Republic's most-used single plot---the basis for "The Leathernecks Have Landed"-"Rough Riders Round-Up", "Guns in the Dark", "Remember Pearl Harbor" and a couple of other films from Republic---and with revisions to fit the Autry mold, Gene Autry('Gene Autry (I)' (qv)) and his pals Dusty Morgan ('Bob Steele (I)' (qv)) and Pokie ('Sterling Holloway' (qv)) are in Mexico where Dusty is killed. With the help of Elena Del Rio ('Adele Mara' (qv)), whose father has also been murdered by unknown assailants, Gene discovers that the killings tie in with a jewel-smuggling scheme. Gene's friend has been murdered near a Mexican border crossing and it appears to be the work of jewelry smugglers. Gene meets Elena whose father disappeared at the same border crossing. Elena has some jewels and she lets Gene borrow them. He first uses them to find out who the smugglers are and then uses them as bait in an effort to trap them.
