 1944. Cederqvist comes to a small cloth factory to see how the all-women employees can work more effeciently. At the beginning he is greeted with suspicion and his efforts at courting the young ladies are futile. But as soon as he buys himself a car it becomes much easier, especially since he has the power to relocate people to an easier line of work.
