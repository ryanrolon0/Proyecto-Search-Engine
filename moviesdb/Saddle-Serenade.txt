Saddle Serenade

 Doris Rogers, half owner of a dude ranch, as Jimmy Wakely, "Lasses" White and Dusty Smith to help run it. U.S. Marshal Tom Logan, posing as a stage driver, is killed during a mock holdup of new arrivals to the ranch. Brenda Amers and Horatio Pennypacker, eastern jewel thieves, bring their loot to Roy Williams, who owns the other half of the ranch as a blind for his gang which resells stolen jewels. Vaughn, the desk clerk, re-cuts the jewels in a secret room in the ice house. Fearing he will be caught, Brenda refuses Williams her stolen diamonds and hides them in a bar of soap. Williams, in an attempt to locate the diamonds, kidnaps Brenda and Pennypacker. Jimmy forces Al Higgins, who shot Logan who was investigating the setup, into leading him to the cabin where they are being held. When ranch guest Fanny Vandercop accuses "Lasses" in front of some of Williams' henchmen of giving her a bar of soap containing ground glass, he and the diamonds are taken over by the gang, and "Lasses" is left prisoner in the ice house.
