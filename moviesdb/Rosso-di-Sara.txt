Rosso di Sara

 A dinner invite with murder. Sara is a rich and famous writers of crime novels, who is sick and forced to live her life on a wheelchair. On the evening of her birthday, she celebrates together with her husband and her younger sister. A double betrayal takes place in a fancy old fashioned restaurant, where things are not exactly as they appear. In its dark and spectral toilet, the intimate truth about the characters' soul unravels. A Hitchcock style ironic and scornful film.
