The Rosary and the Gun

 The story is about a man's constant struggle with his faith.  This man started  with an unquestionable believe in God.  His first test was the death of his twin brother.  Instead of following his religious beliefs of hating the sin and loving the sinner, his anger drove him to avenge the murder.  During this event he broke with God and turned to the dark side.  Ten years later he rediscovers his faith in God,  sparked by re-uniting with a long time forgotten female friend.  Again, the story takes this man to the edge by the repetition of the death of someone dear to his heart.  His female friend  was  executed in front of his eyes.   Once more, he avenges her death.  Following the massive killings, he repents and has an epiphany driving him to come to terms with the true act of forgiveness.
