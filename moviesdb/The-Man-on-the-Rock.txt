The Man on the Rock

 History records that Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to the island of St. Helena and that he died there in 1821. This film explores the possibility that the man who died on St. Helena was a look-alike that Napoleon used often during his reign as emperor of France, and that Napoleon actually died two years later while attempting to visit his young son.
