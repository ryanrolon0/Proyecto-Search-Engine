The Legend of Shadow Ridge

 A documentary crew interviews the owner of Irving Ranch, Clovis Irving, and learns about the Legend of Shadow Ridge. In 1850, a band of men were ordered to leave the Irving Ranch. Instead, they showed-up at the Irving home begging for food. When Lady Irving refused their request, they killed her in cold blood. Now she roams the ranch searching for her assailants. To corroborate the story, the documentary team interviews neighbors that live near the ranch. They come across a group of men who join them on their quest to Shadow Ridge. Things turn for the worst when they defy the no trespassing signs and Clovis' warning and enter the land at night.
