 A documentary that explores how the turban as a symbol has become synonymous with terrorism. In doing so, writer presenter and producer Jay Singh-Sohal discovers why some Muslims wear it during prayers, how it's an important part of Sikh identity, and what the art of the renaissance has to say about the turbans role in early Christianity.
