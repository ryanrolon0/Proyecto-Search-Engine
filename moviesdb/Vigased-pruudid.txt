 Father has decided that his two daughters should get married to his two proud and rich nephews from Mulgimaa. The only problem is that the girls already have lovers, two local (not so wealthy) boys. The girls and their lovers then plan to frighten away the unwanted grooms by using the fact that neither the girls nor the nephews have actually seen each other.
