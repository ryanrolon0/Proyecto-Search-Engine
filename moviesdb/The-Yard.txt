The Yard

 What really happens in the school yard when the teachers aren't looking? Welcome to a world where the kids have a hidden mean streak plus super-human powers, all turning this playground into an adventurous urban war zone. It's up to a seven year-old boy with a crush and a Twinkie to defend his entire school against the Dark Side.
