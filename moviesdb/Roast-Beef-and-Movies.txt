Roast-Beef and Movies

 Three good-for-nothings overhear a movie producer and his partners offering a grand sum if someone will present him with a sure-fire movie idea. The leader of the three dopes, Gus Parkyakarkus, barges into the meeting with his cohorts and proceeds to rattle off spiels for several inane prospective movies. The three are delighted to be told they've made a sale, but the producers turn out to have a surprise in store.
