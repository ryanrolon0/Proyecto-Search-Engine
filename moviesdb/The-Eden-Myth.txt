The Eden Myth

 Can you keep a family secret? Prepare to enter the dark and funny world of the Speck family. Ruled by gray-haired patriarch Vincent Speck, they appear to be your average upper-class American family as they gather together for the weekend. Siblings snipe at each other behind their backs, and the parents worry about the future. Signs that all is not well within the Specks' world begin when Vincent announces the arranged marriage of his son Aldo to a woman he has never met. They are set to marry the next day. Soon after the wedding, the eldest son, Edward, is found dead in his bedroom. What's going on here?
