The Dirty Monks

 Ten years ago, four young men under the stern leadership of Jim Moore signed a pact to uphold liberty and bring justice to those wronged. The Dirty Monks were an underground success in defending the defenseless and offending the offensive with an arsenal of toilet paper and eggs. Their revolution had a solid foundation. Their followers were loyal and unwavering, albeit nerdy. That was ten years ago. Now, long after high school, the four are still waging war against jocks and bullies, but after losing his job and girlfriend, Brian decides he'll be better off without his old friends and their pointless crusade. Scott and Norm give up after being tortured by some grocery store henchmen. The Dirty Monks are falling apart and just as someone really needs them...
