The Winning of La Mesa

 The little cow-town of LaMesa was controlled by old Tex Garvin, proprietor of the Garvin gambling place. He kept Pretty Peggy about the saloon to jolly up the "boys" when the Goddess of Fortune frowned. Then came a handsome young minister with his mother and sister and when one of the cowpunchers insulted the sister Peggy's reformation occurred. She went to live with the minister's family and the "boys" all promised to join the church. But Garvin, loving Peggy, drank himself into a murderous fury and determined to revenge himself upon the minister. A catastrophe was averted by the timely work of Peggy.
