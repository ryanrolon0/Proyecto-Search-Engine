This Is How You'll Make Your Bed in Prison

 The story of Vickie Lee Roach, an Indigenous prisoner who took the Howard Government to the High Court of Australia in a landmark civil rights case. Interweaving flickering childhood memories, poetry and intimate reflections on her life the film builds a portrait of Vickie, exploring her experience as a survivor of the Stolen Generations, snapshots from life on the fringes, reflections on time in prison and finally her fight for justice in the highest court in the land.
