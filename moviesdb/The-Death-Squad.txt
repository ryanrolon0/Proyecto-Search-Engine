The Death Squad

 When petty criminals start turning up murdered, a detective discovers they are being killed by a group of his fellow officers who think the criminals were treated too leniently by the courts. A squad of policemen who disagree with court rulings take the law into their own hands and start to make justice with their own way. An investigator is assigned the task of discovering their identity and hunting them down.
