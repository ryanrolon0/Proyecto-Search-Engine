The Phantom of the Range

 A man has died leaving a fortune somewhere on his ranch. Brandon and his cohorts think a map is hidden in a picture frame. But when they bid on the picture at the auction, newcomer Jerry Lane outbids them. He also buys the ranch so they place their housekeeper there to get the picture. And then to keep Jerry out of the way, they frame him for murder. Jerry Lane ('Tom Tyler (I)' (qv)), a young rancher, happens in on an auction sale of the ranch of the late Hiram Moore, a noted miser. His curiosity is aroused by the unwarranted high bidding for a certain picture and he buys it and the ranch, and then goes for explanations to Jeanne Moore ('Beth Marion' (qv)). She explains that there is a rumor that her grandfather had a large amount of money hidden somewhere on the ranch and that the chart showing the location of his treasure is, in all probability, hidden in the picture. Jerry hires Jeanne as his secretary, and Perdita ('Soledad Jiminez (I)' (qv)), a combination chaperon and cook. He also hires Eddie Parsons ('Sammy Cohen' )qv)), a cockney kleptomaniac, to serve as his general handy man. Brandon ('Forrest Taylor(I)' (qv)), a neighboring rancher, was one of those who bid high on the picture. He, intent on obtaining the chart, makes an agreement with several of his associates and hires Mark Braden ('Charles King (II)' (qv), an ex-prizefighter, to assault Jerry on the town street. This doesn't work, so with the assistance of Perdita, steals the picture. But Eddie has found and removed the chart and, not before some soul-searching, gives it to Jerry. Mark, who has been playing the part of a Phantom Rider, who scares people away from the ranch, rebels at the way he is being treated by Brandon. The latter has him killed and fixes the blame on Jerry. Producer 'Sam Katzman' (qv) made this one again in 1939 as "Straight Shooter" with ('Tim McCoy (I)' (qv)). Katzman was never one to buy new scripts when he old ones gathering dust in his office.
