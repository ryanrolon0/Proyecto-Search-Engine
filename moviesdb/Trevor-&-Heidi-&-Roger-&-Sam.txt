Trevor & Heidi & Roger & Sam

 Two couples, close friends, watch a provocative French movie featuring orgies and partner swapping. The guys get the idea that it would be fun to try this with their girlfriends. At first the girls are appalled, but after a time, they get into the idea. The men don't question their good fortune, as the two women strip down and throw them onto the bed.But the women are really out to teach them a lesson. The evening does not go as planned.
