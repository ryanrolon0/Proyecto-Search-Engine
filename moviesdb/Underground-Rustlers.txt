Underground Rustlers

 Gold stages are being held up in the far west at a time when the U.S. government needs bullion, just before the famed "Black Friday" attempt to corner the gold market. The government sends the Range Busters, Crash Corrigan, Dusty King and Alibi Terhune, to Gold Butte, an important bullion dispensing center, to put an end to the stage robberies.
