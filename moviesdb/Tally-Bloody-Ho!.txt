Tally Bloody Ho!

 Tally Bloody Ho! depicts the day in the life of a hunt with the three protagonists, the fox, the hunter and the saboteur. The soundtrack is taken from the days out on hunts themselves including the arguments of those involved. It challenges the audience to see for themselves the rituals of hunter and hunted and hear the battles on the field that occur with this controversial and recently banned sport in the UK. You are left with the words 'We own all this land' as the distorted rifts of 'Jerusalem' play us out to a red screen.
