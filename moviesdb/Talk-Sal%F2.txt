Talk Salò

 When Spencer urges his unsuspecting friend, Aaron, to watch _Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975)_ (qv), 'Pier Paolo Pasolini' (qv)'s profoundly disturbing film, the horrifying experience rips into Aaron's sense of security and morality. Confused, betrayed and disgusted, Aaron asks of his friend, "Why did you show me that?" But Spencer's motives are much too complex for words.
