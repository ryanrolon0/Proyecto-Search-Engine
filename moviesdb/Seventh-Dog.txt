Seventh Dog

 Soraya, a French Arab, and her Saudi boyfriend Yusif's relationship frays to the snapping point as the FBI, Homeland Security and the super's remaining six dogs plague their daily lives following the calamity of the seventh dog... which is all Yusif's fault. This is a black comedy which excellently portrays the poignant, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic truths of the post-9/11 lifestlye of Arabs in New York City. Soraya and Yusif live in post 9/11 New York. One night, an encounter with Soraya's Super turns an unfortunate accident into something more sinister. The couple's lives spiral out of control. Broken-hearted and frustrated Soraya meets the complexity of cold reality.
