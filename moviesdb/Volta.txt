Volta

 Volta is a journey through a crumbling art deco cinema nestled in the outskirts of rural Ghana. Closed in 1997 after years of mismanagement and disrepair, The Volta cinema is now home to a mission school for children from the nearby Muslim community. A former projectionist of The Volta and local residents provide a retrospective on the cinema, from it's heyday in the 50s, 60s and 70s to its eventual closure.
