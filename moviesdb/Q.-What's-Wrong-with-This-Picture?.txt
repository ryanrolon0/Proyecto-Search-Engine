Q. What's Wrong with This Picture?

 On a good day, there are over 8 million stories in New York City. September 11th was not a good day. Jason Kessler is a filmmaker who has lived for over a decade in a quaint and quiet neighborhood less than a mile from what was once the World Trade Center. This is a film about what he saw when he left home one morning and looked up. And what he saw and heard during the days and nights that followed in the no-longer-familiar streets of his hometown. Completed within three weeks of the collapse of the World Trade Center, "Q. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?" is a powerful, articulate film about a neighborhood, a tragedy, and the first spasms of healing that followed. It is a story about ordinary people kidnapped into a new reality. Above all, it is a valentine to a City that was supposed to have fallen apart, but that instead amazed us all. And it is an important film with a message that America and the world need to hear right now between love and hate that exists in every country and in every soul, love wins. See for yourself.
