Shema

 Inspired by a true event, Shema tells the story of sacrifice, and a bond shared between a feeble father, Simon, and his headstrong son, Eli, fleeing from a concentration camp in wartime Poland. En route to a transport to make their escape, their plight is interrupted when Nazi SS begin closing in on their location. Simon and Eli must take action.
