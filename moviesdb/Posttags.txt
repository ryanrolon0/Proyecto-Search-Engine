 Young military veteran Sgt. James Weston battles an everyday struggle with remnants of a war he thought he left behind. Traumatized by his experience during operation Iraqi Freedom, Sgt. Weston, "JW", finds himself in a society he no longer recognizes. Facing the perils of everyday life in New York City, and his inability to hold a job, he turns to playing his guitar in the New York City subway stations for a living. He encounters Private Cole Pullman, a soldier he was stationed with during his tour in Iraq. Their chance encounter conjures up hidden memories for both, and "JW" is faced with dealing with what haunts him. He soon realizes he brought home more than he bargained for. This is a story of a soldier with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder struggling to retain his sanity and survive in New York City.
