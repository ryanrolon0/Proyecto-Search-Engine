SEance

 Cecil, a struggling writer, faces this question when he decides to hire a spiritualist (and a dubious con-artist) named Ester to contact his friend and mentor Charley. Charley is the only person who can help sort out Cecil's issues as a writer. However, Cecil betrayed Charley, and now Cecil wants absolution for his past sins and a chance to make it big. Does Ester really contact Charley, or is it all one big con? And in the end, does it matter if it really is Charley?
