The Ladytrap

 A beautiful heiress is bound, gagged and kidnapped. An equally lovely detective tracks the victim to a mysterious house where the kidnapped and five other victims are found securely roped and muzzled. Will the wily police officer discover who perpetrated the dastardly crime before other lovely bondagettes fall into her clutches?
