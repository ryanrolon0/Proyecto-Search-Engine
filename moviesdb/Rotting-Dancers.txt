Rotting Dancers

 A mockumentary detailing the artistic struggle of a novice film director forced to direct a documentary detailing the lives of a bizarre group of new-age "silhouette dancers". After enlisting his actor/friend Ugo and coxing him into pretending to be a well respected Italian cinematographer the two embark on a surreal adventure hoping to bring the project to completion while keeping up a professional appearance. When things don't turn out exactly how they had planed their very friendship is put into question.
