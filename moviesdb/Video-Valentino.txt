Video Valentino

 Eddie Hayes is working on the beach fixing bikes during the day, but by night he becomes a Casanova through a dating service, "Video Valentino." He goes on a series of dates, one with a valley girl who's a dancing troll at Magic Mountain, a female performance artist, who turns out to be a man (Allison Argrim) and a Phy-Ed instructor who's just trying to make her boyfriend jealous.
