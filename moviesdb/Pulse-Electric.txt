Pulse Electric

 Set in a post-apocalyptic world in which robots are the only species left standing, Pulse Electric is the story of RX-9, a human-looking robot, who is unable to move on from the events that took away his family. He tries to recapture humanity by reading romantic novels, delving into the concept of human love, and ultimately ends up pursuing the female robot down the street, B2-T. After the cities announce that they are shutting down all power to the suburbs, the two decide to set off together in order to survive, but B2-T has a brutal lesson in store for RX-9.
