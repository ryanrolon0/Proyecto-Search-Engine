Toto La Momposina

 Toto La Momposina embodies that fertile ground where Colombia's African, Indigenous Indian and Spanish cultures mingle to create a unique musical tradition. Her entire life she has dedicated to preserving and representing Colombia's Caribbean coastline traditional music, and that dedication has given her a solid place in the cultural identity of her country. Nonetheless, Sonia Bazanta, the woman, the daughter, the mother, and Colombia's musical ambassador, has a compelling past marked by countless sacrifices and critical moments of survival. Retracing her steps, she embarks on a journey filled with memories of being displaced by civil war as a child, singing in the Paris Metro as a struggling musician, and becoming the renowned world artist she is today. Parallel to her ancestral and personal journey, Toto will travel on her first European tour in 5 years and will engage on a succession of artistic collaborations as a "Cantandora del mundo" during a important creative transition in her life. And it is here, in this key moment of her international career, in the midst of challenges and triumphs, and with this documentary film that Toto is willing to open her heart and soul to reaffirm that her fundamental need is to preserve her identity and to continue being the woman who lives to sing and who sings to live.
