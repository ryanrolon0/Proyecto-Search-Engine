The Nagger at Breakfast

 A constantly bickering couple - the nagging wife and the henpecked husband - have breakfast together before he sets off for work. He wants her to clean the table and make the coffee and she of course wants him to do more around the house. Their main point of contention is the time. He has a 7 train to catch and every clock in the house seems to be slightly off. To make matters worse, it's the first day of Daylight Saving Time.
