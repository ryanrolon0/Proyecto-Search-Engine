She Wore Silver Wings

 A true story of Women Airforce Service Pilots told by (WASP), Jean Landis. Brave women pilots who, for the first time in the history of the United States, were recruited to volunteer their services in WWII by ferrying fighter planes, test flying new and repaired planes, and towing targets in the air for live artillery practice. How the WASPs were formed, the incredible challenges they faced and the cause of their early demise. These heroic young women of the 1940's flew over 60 million miles for the US Army and opened the door for today's military female pilots. It's a subject that is still not well known but in 2009 President Obama signed a bill to award the WASPs The Congressional Gold Medal. On March 10th, 2010 a ceremony was held in Washington D.C. honoring and thanking the WASPs for their service.
