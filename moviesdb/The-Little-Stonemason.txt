The Little Stonemason

 'The Little Stonemason' is inspired by a painting by Canaletto Stonemason's Yard.' I was drawn to the rich earthy hues and workman's scenario, which I have incorporated into my film. The film is set in another world called 'Espera' where stonemasons toil on the cliffs. A young boy creates stone structures from the off cuts of the cliff, while a mischievous and erratic chicken tries to knock it down. The animation looks at the interplay between two different characters and how they react to their opposing personalities. Under the surface there is a play on the theme of transience and permanence reflected in the shack-like living spaces and the more solid stone structures.
