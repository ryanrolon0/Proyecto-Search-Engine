Swimming in a Dream

 This film tells the story of how and why a group of otherwise perfectly normal people do a hard swim workout at 5 the North Bay Aquatics Masters Swimmers in Corte Madera, California go through a profound physical and mental change while swimming more than 3000 yards for each workout. Swimmers explain how they are addicted to, and changed by, the swimmer's high. This positive addiction to their health and fitness keeps them returning day after day. The filmmakers used a Nikon D3s camera both on land and underwater. Edited in Final Cut Pro on a 27' iMac computer and Seagate storage devices.
