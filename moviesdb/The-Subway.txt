 'Just how safe are you underground?' Kirsten McCall watches the morning newscaster tell of a serial rapist plaguing the New York City Subway system, and thinks it could never happen to her. But strange things start happen to her when a stranger shows interest in her, could he be the Subway Stalker? Forced into taking the Subway late at night is only the beginning of a night that Kirsten will never forget.
