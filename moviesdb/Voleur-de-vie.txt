Voleur de vie

 Alda, her sister Olga, and the latter's daughter Sigga live together in an old house facing a cemetery by the sea. Self-assured Alda collects men; Olga shuns them, but cannot help following the activities of Alda (who receives her lovers in the sisters' house) with some envy. In their own way, both women refuse any emotional ties with other people, while keeping a strange attachment to their family's past, their deceased parents, and a third, deceased, sister. Will they, and will Sigga, be able to escape that environment imbued by the presence of death and find their way to a true life ?
