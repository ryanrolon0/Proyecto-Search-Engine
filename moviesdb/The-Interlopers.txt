The Interlopers

 In the tradition of the legendary Hatfield-McCoy feud, The Interlopers is the story of two rival families engaged in a civil war deep in the wilderness of a harsh mountain terrain. For years the Von Gradwitz and Znaeym sons have clashed over the ownership rights to a treasured piece of hunting territory, and on a particular night in the dead of winter, each enemy will be forced to confront a simple truth neither rewards, nor punishments, there are consequences.
