 What if today you could know about an incident that will happen tomorrow... Will you panic? Will you take action? Or will you ignore it? Izabella Nivoli gets that opportunity after inheriting her past cousin's radio that tells tomorrows death incidents today. But before she realizes that the radio possesses the ability to tell tomorrows deadly truth, it just might be too late!
