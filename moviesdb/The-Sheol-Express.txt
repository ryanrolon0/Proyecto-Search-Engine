The Sheol Express

 Tired of traveling the underworld, Owen Turner boards The Sheol Express, a fantastical train that ferries souls to their final resting place at the End of the Line. Once aboard, Owen must choose where to disembark End of the Line or at the second-to-last stop near the alleged paradise of Araboth.
