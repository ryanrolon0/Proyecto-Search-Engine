The Comedy Team of Pete & James

 On the first night of their shoot a documentary filmmaker and his crew catch the breakup of the up-and-coming comedy team Pete and James. Not wanting to scrap the project the director continues filming, but James is the only member of the duo he has access to. Out on his own James' stand-up career falters miserably while Pete becomes a huge star on television and in movies. Documenting the former partners on their vastly divergent paths in the world of entertainment ultimately leads to a rumored reunion back in the comedy club where it all began.
