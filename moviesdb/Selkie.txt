Selkie

 When a teenaged boy learns that his mother has taken a job on a remote island off mainland Australia, he is shattered that he must leave his friends and girlfriend and come with them. But what begins as the worst experience of his entire life becomes an important journey of discovery, as he learns that he is somehow connected with a mysterious and legendary line of Selkies - people from ancient Scotland who have the power to change into seals. An Australian teenager has more than his fair share of anxieties. He discovers that he is a Selkie, a magical creature that is part seal, part human. Anxious to throw off the curse, which includes webbed fingers and a hairy back, he makes a deal with an outcast woman, until a special friend helps him to feel proud of who he is.
