The Scrappin' Kid

 Bill Bradley, bachelor rancher, allows Betty Brent and her younger brother, whose father has been killed, to continue to homestead a grazing section on his ranch. But Betty is eighteen and the town gossips are wearing out their wagging tongues, so Bill asks the sheriff and his kindly wife to take them into their home. When he returns home, Bill is met by three outlaws who taken him captive, but he is able to send his trained dog, Rex, with a message to the sheriff. Bill is knocked out in the fight that follows and Betsy, who has just ridden up, is abducted by the outlaws and taken to their cave hideout. But Bill is on their trail and vowing vengeance.
