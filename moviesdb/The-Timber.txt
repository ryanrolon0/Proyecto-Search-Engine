The Timber

 Geoffrey is almost 70 years old and resides in a 44-acre timber in Iowa. He was raised across the road from the timber, and in 1982, his childhood dream of living in the woods came true. 28 years later, he reflects on his love for home and family in this short documentary from Darren Peak.
