Sasek a královna

 Originally a theater play starring Bolek Polivka (Czech) and his wife Chantal Poullain-Polivkova (French), the movie is a satirical look at foreign occupation - a medieval Czech jester entertains a German king and his French wife, or a modern Czech villager helps a Bavarian hunter and his French wife find wild boar in Bohemia - the story switches back and forth between the two plots and time-periods. Listen as the jester corrects the queen's Czech, proclaiming "Neumí Çe-e-e-sky" Polívka uses traditional pantomime techniques as part of the jester's repertoire.
