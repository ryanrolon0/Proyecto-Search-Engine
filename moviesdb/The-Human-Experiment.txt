The Human Experiment

 Two lifeless figures wash up on the surreal beaches of Malibu California, only to find that they are in fact just that - lifeless souls booted from God's Kingdom, sentenced to a seven day stay in Purgatory. We follow our two heroes, Leon and Harper, as they explore the underbelly of their figurative limbo, the city of Los Angeles. Depressed, yet laughing all the way, our protagonists fall prey to the notion of a consequence free 'afterlife with a nightlife'. In a darkly existential comedy, the polar opposites Leon and Harper become friends, drowning under a waterfall of free drinks. Tension builds as these new found friends face their seven day deadline and ultimate decision...'Stay in Hell, or go to Heaven?'
