The Wind-Up Life

 This is about the idea of the intersection between dreams and reality. It depicts the connection between what we dream at night and the stress we feel during the day. Symbolically, the idea of pressure is represented by an ocean and fish to show the idea of mentally drowning. My animated film uses dream-like imagery to metaphorically portray the struggles of a person dealing with everyday life.
