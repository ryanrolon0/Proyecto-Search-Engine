The Caretaker

 Roland, suffers from a most unusual detriment . One that causes people near him to drop dead. This has caused Roland an unnatural amount of grief, causing him to accept life as a recluse; nihilistic and withdrawn. Roland will discover that sometimes the worse situations can hide cloaked in the chaos, our calling. For Roland, a chance crossing with a dying girl will spell out his reason for existing, and uncloak his future purpose in the universe.
