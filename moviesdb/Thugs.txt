Thugs

 Can two down and out criminals find happiness after they quit the mob? Maybe...but there is one problem. In their world, happiness starts with money - but that's also where trouble begins. Now if they can only hide from their old boss, and persuade some angry cohorts to join their cause, they'll be on their way to finding fulfillment in this dark and twisted comedy.
