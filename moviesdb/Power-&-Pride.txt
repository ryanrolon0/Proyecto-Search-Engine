Power & Pride

 Senator David Fletcher is a popular politician and family man, whose rapid ascent to power has astonished critics. However, his fast-track career has not come without cost his faith as he's begun to compromise his values in his quest for more power and influence. When a top political consultant convinces David to run for Governor his decision sets him on a course that will further tear apart the fabric of his family, and engulf him in the midst of a political scandal that threatens to destroy him, his family, and everything he's worked for.
