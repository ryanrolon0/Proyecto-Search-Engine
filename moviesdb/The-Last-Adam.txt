The Last Adam

 When middle-aged Bobby Jackson returns home to Lake City, Alabama he wonders about the lives of 'the Bama Rascals,' a band of misfits he led in the seventies. Have the last 20 years been difficult for them as well? Thankfully, when they were growing up as the most diverse bunch in a military, mostly white town, Coach Billy Adams and his wife Betty rescued them with the all-American pastime of baseball. But its been years since they've been together and now that Coach Billy has died from a massive heart attack, the Rascals must face their past serving as pallbearers for his funeral. Tormented by their current life situations and haunted by troubled pasts, will their homecoming be more bitter than sweet?
