Pulp Boy

 He thought technology was ruining science fiction, but he just found out its ruined him. Pulp Boy is the story of Emerson LaSalle--the eccentric king of sci-fi paperbacks--as he embarks on the adventure of his life scrambling to save his career by promoting one last great novel. LaSalle's promotional tour takes a turn for the worst when he finds himself pitted against enraged fans, violent old ladies, and his long-time nemesis and rival, Stone Q. Mann. The result is a hilarious romp through book stores, sci-fi conventions, and bars across the country as LaSalle flies by the seat of his pants to the end of one career, and the beginning of another.
