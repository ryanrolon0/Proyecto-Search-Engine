UCF

 In 2078 something had stopped the motor of the world. Decades later, civilization is still recovering from the global network crash. In this post- dystopian age, remnants of the old technologies remain, including cyborgs and man-machine interfaces. To regulate the disaffected remnants - colloquially known as 'Burnouts' - the Unified Cybernetics Foundation is formed to deal with post-human law enforcement. It is now 2106, one hundred years in the present. When two Toronto police detectives are caught in the middle of a specific multiple murder case involving Burnouts, UCF sends one of their Marshals to assist. And when the Foundation gets involved, nothing is ever simple.
