Report from Ground Zero

 This quietly powerful two-hour special, based on Dennis Smith's best-selling book, honors the spirit of heroism, as rescuers who made it through the tragic events of September 11 recall friends, brothers and sons who lost their lives. Sadness, relief and bewilderment mix as survivors wonder why they were spared.
