The Latent Spark

 The last installment of the mortgage was due on James Crosby's place and he had not the funds to meet it. Crosby's daughter, Sallie, sacrificed all she had and still a $10 deficit remained. Then Ed Wilbur, ranch hand, came forth with his last penny and added to the little pile, making just enough to clear the mortgage. Sallie felt warmly toward him, but, a day later, looking into the yard, she saw Johnston, a burly mountain renegade, knock Ed down and when he rose Johnston knocked him down again. Johnston, sneering from the yard, called back to her, pointing derisively at the prostrate Ed. Later the mountain renegade stole the mortgage funds. The family saw him do it and were powerless. Ed coming up, saw, and Johnston, with a laugh, felled him, mounted his horse and was off. Then rose the latent spirit in Ed. Leaping to his own horse, he gave pursuit. He reached the fast traveling thief, closed with him and the joy came at last to Ed. Furiously they struggled and the thief was hauled bodily from his saddle, the money taken from him and the former coward, now hero, rode back in triumph to his sweetheart.
