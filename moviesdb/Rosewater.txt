Rosewater

 Images of connections and disconnection. A solitary man sits in a car in an abandoned field next to a power tower and a bridge. Into view comes a stranger carrying a bucket of water. He washes the solitary man's car windows, raps on the glass, and leaves a rose. We see the solitary man in a basement studying the rose. He goes back to the field to plant it. He dons a gas mask and sprays the flower. It crumples. He puts the petals in a basin of water and splashes his face.
