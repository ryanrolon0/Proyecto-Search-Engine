Shiro no jinzô bijo

 In this bizarre world of distorted human pleasures, we have come to accept the most heinous crimes against mankind as just another example of the degeneration of our species. Even the most jaded individual could not forgive the creators of the Love Robots. Love Robots are beautiful young girls, abducted right off the street who, through a procedure that rivals anything the Marquis de Sade might have dreamt of, are turned into monsters, capable of killing a man or loving him on command. The Love Robots then become an item for sale, willing to accept any master and perform any act. The Love Robots must surely be the lowest ebb of slave trading. Now through the bold new techniques of an eroduction this sordid practice is brought to light in a manner that, until very recently, could not have been shown. Only now can the intimate eye of the camera reveal the lust, greed and abnormal practices in such shocking detail. Only now can no one fail to realize the consequences of the tragic transformation of these girls to the sensual, sadistic Love Robots.
