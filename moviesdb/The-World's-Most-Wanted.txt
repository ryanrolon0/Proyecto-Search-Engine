The World's Most Wanted

 As America comes to terms with the attacks on New York and Washington, Panorama asks how the terrorists carried it out, and who was behind them. Osama Bin Laden has quickly become the prime suspect in the investigation. Reporter Jane Corbin, who first investigated Bin Laden in 1998, examines the evidence that he is behind the latest attacks on America. The programme joins the hunt for clues in New York, and reveals how the city is coping with the devastation.
