The Naked Dawn

 Santiago, a jolly modern bandito, has just lost his partner when he happens on the isolated farm of young Manuel and Maria Lopez. Manuel's aid is enlisted in what develops into a violent encounter with Santiago's fence. Exposed to money, the fast life, and Santiago's anarchistic philosophy, Manuel (formerly simple and hardworking) is in serious danger of being corrupted (and Maria is not immune either)... After pulling a robbery, Santiago and his partner are fired upon and the partner dies from his wound. Santiago hires a young land-owner, Maunel Lopez, to take him to town, where he delivers to loot to a fence, Guntz. The latter tries to cheat Santiago and he then takes it all by force. He and Manuel go for a time on the town before returning to Manuel's farm. Manuel, having a taste of the good life, plots to kill Santiago. Manuel's wife, Maria, is shocked and fed up and begs Santiago to leave and take her with him. As they start to leave, the Police and Guntz show up and take Manuel and attempt to make him talk by threatening to hang him. Santiago intervenes and shoots Guntz and is mortally wounded himself, but manages to send Manuel and Maria on their way before he goes off to die alone.
