The Queen

 Diana the 'People's Princess' has died in a car accident in Paris. The Queen and her family decide that for the best, they should remain hidden behind the closed doors of Balmoral Castle. The heartbroken public do not understand and request that the Queen comforts her people. This also puts pressure on newly elected Tony Blair, who constantly tries to convince the monarchy to address the public. In 1997, after the death of Lady Di in a car accident in Paris, the reluctant Queen and The Establishment do not accept to honor the "People's Princess" as a member of the Royal Family. However, the public and the media question the utility of the monarchy and the just-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair advises the Queen to make a public speech mourning the loss of Diana. The Queen is an intimate behind the scenes glimpse at the interaction between HRM Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Tony Blair during their struggle following the death of Diana, to reach a compromise between what was a private tragedy for the royal family and the public's demand for an overt display of mourning.
