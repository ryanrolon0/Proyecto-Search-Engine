Throne for a Loss

 Honey Halfwitch is assisting Stanley in his magic act. Stanley attempts to pull a rabbit from a hat, but the rabbit pulls him into the hat instead. Humiliated, Stanley heads home with Honey in tow. They are stopped in an alley by a frog who tells them that he used to be a king. The frog asks Stanley to turn him back into a king and Stanley agrees. Honey suggests that Stanley use Cousin Maggie's magic book to assist him with the spell. Stanley returns the frog to its former state, which to Stanley and Honey's shock is a lion, king of beasts.
