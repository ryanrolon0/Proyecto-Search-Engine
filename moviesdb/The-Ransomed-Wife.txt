The Ransomed Wife

 Everett thinks his wife is off on a business trip to Australia, so he thinks the phone calls from an alleged kidnapper are a prank. That is, until he starts receiving videotapes of his lovely wife bound and gagged. Then Everett starts to wonder if he really wants his wife back safe and sound after all.
