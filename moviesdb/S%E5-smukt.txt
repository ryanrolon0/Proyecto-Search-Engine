Så smukt

 Anne and Karina meet in a cafE, where they pass the time reading the lonely hearts columns. They regularly contact some of the men who have placed ads and later divert each other with their adventures. Today, however, when Anne tells about her first meeting with Erik, a nervous photographer, Karina gets more and more interested and decides to go and see him herself.
