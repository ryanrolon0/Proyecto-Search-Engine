Si wang mo ta

 It's approaching World War 2 and China is suspecting invasion from Germany and Japan. Mr Ang (Bruce Le) is hired by a Chinese group who are after a "secret doccument". Many other groups want to get their hands on it as well. It's on the top floor of a tower and Ang must fight his way to the top.
