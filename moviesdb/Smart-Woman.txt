Smart Woman

 The last credited screenplay by Alvah Bessie, using his own name, as he was soon to become one of the Hollywood Ten. This one is a 1940s gender-clasher involving a crusading district attorney, Robert Larrimore, butting heads in court with defense attorney Paula Rogers. They fall in love. But there is a small problem; Paula realizes that she must reveal that her on-trial client, FRank McCoy, is also her former husband...and she fears this may damage her relationship with Larrimore, and her son.
