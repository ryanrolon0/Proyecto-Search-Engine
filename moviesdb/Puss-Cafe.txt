Puss Cafe

 Milton the cat is walking down the street and notices a yard full of delicious milk, birds, and fish not realizing it is guarded by Pluto. He shows his inferior minded pal Richard the set up and both help themselves to the goodies but are chased out by Pluto. From that point on, they try to get into the yard without waking Pluto using such tactics as sling-shooting Pluto out of the yard with his hammock and underwater diving for fish with a makeshift diving helmet. Two alley cats think they have found paradise in Mickey's yard, or at least a free buffet leaping in the pond. With such attractions, the "Beware of Dog" sign is no deterrent. The cats make short work of the milk, but Pluto chases them off. They return for the birds, without much success. Finally, they go after the fish, and make good progress, having sent Pluto flying across town by using his hammock as a slingshot. But Pluto returns just in time, and chases them all the way to their home, where they have a surprise waiting for him.
