The Parade of Naval Veterans

 "This picture shows the old marines who fought so nobly on the seas; they are accompanied by the more modern Spanish-American naval veterans, with Gatling gun hauled through the streets by sailors, and the parade of the U.S. life-saving crew. Good picture; very exciting and patriotic."
