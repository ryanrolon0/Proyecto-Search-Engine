The Hollywood Detective

 After nearly twenty years of decline, once legendary TV detective Harry Powell has been branded by Hollywood as a washed up drunk. Alone, broke and desperately unemployed, he decides to commit suicide but is saved by a knock at the door and the fact that the gas company has shut him off. A young fan appears and offers to pay Harry more money than he can refuse to find a missing actor. But when Harry finds the actor dead, the police arrest him as their prime murder suspect. Now Harry has to pull himself together if he isn't going to take the fall for a murder he didn't commit.
