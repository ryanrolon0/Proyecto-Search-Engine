Upper Falls of the Yellowstone

 This picture shows this celebrated spectacle of nature in the highest state of its grandeur. As this immense volume of angry water falls from its dizzy height, clearly defined against its rocky background and striking with such force on the bed of the river below, you imagine you can almost hear the roar of the cataract and feel the spray you see rising in the clouds settling on your faces.
