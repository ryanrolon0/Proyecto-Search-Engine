 In the name of Globalization, Peruvian Indigenous People pay the Price for International Oil, Gas and Mining Company Profits. Since 1971, Los-Angles-based Occidental Petroleum, using practices outlawed in the U.S., pumped an average of 800,000 barrels a day of toxic salty formation waste water containing cyanide, lead, arsenic and mercury, among other contaminants, into local rivers with appalling consequences for local communities .The Achuar, Quichua and Urarinas peoples in the Corrientes river basin in the Peruvian Amazon are being poisoned by their only water source, which they depend on for drinking ,fishing and bathing.
