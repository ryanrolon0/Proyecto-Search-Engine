Tokyo Underworld

 In 1945 Nick Zappetti, an Italian-American from East Harlem, was part of the U.S. Occupation forces sent to post World War II Japan. Realizing that Tokyo offered certain opportunities, Nick had a failed stint as a wrestler, participated in a fumbled diamond heist, and was deported but returned illegally. Driven to make it in Japan, Nick then opened a pizza joint, which in the mid 1960s became the center of Tokyo's nightlife, and for the next 15 years Nick became the "king of Roppongi and Mafia boss of Tokyo."
