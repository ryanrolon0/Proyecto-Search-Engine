Te amo

 Sam returns to Chile from the USA after his parents divorce. Left with a sexually-abusive nanny, he makes friends with some other neglected kids Isabel, whose mother suffers from depression after the disappearance of her father and brother, and Daniela whose mother is dead and whose father is an alcoholic. The teenagers get together to make a slasher film dealing with family issues, and finally confront their demons.
