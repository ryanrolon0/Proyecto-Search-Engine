The Passage

 A woman in her 60s with terminal cancer, a man in his 40s recently out of jail, and a British artist in his 50s come together by chance and take a road trip to Marfa, TX. Each are looking for something to give them hope, when hope is in short supply. They share profound experiences, across the Texas landscape from big cities to barren desert towns. What started as a convenient ride becomes much more, an opportunity to heal the deepest wounds, that only love with no strings attached can do.
