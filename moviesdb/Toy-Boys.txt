Toy Boys

 In London, parents prepare their children for the entrance exam to a prestigious public school. The boys seem to be about 8, maybe younger. The parents' behavior runs a narrow spectrum from odd to bizarre, and the children's emotions range from quizzical to bewildered. Parents seem to think this is the ticket to Oxford, Cambridge, a medical degree, and a Nobel Prize. By the end, the exam is over, letters are delivered, and parents open them with fingers crossed. How did the lads do?
