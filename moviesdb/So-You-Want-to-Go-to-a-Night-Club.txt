So You Want to Go to a Night Club

 In this Joe McDoakes Comedy, Alice insists they go to a night club, although Joe is both tired and broke. Once there, where they meet Joe's friend Homer and his girlfriend, Joe gets into the spirit of things, including ordering champagne for all. He can't pay the large tab and follows a conga line out of the club and winds up in the police station.
