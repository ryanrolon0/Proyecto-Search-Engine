Smile Pretty, Say Pink

 A diminutive, pointy-nosed naturalist goes to a national park to photograph the flora and fauna and refuses to donate a small sum of money to a worthy cause kicks the Pink Panther's donation box away and provokes the panther into sabotaging his photographic efforts. The Pink Panther secrets himself in a bush and won't keep the bush still for the photographer to take a desired picture. The panther next commandeers the controls to a wooden bridge and sends the naturalist into a river. He then swallows the little man's flashcubes and lights up every time he hiccups; so, when he runs into the little naturalist's dark-room-hut and hiccups, he ruins the pictures that the man is trying to develop. Next, he sticks his hand, eye, and teeth in all of the little man's pictures. But the little man avenges himself upon the panther by blasting the pink cat with a rifle disguised as a camera.
