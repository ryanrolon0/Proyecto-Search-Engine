The First Law

 In a quarrel over a boundary line, John's father is accidentally killed, and John, believing Bud's father responsible, swears to avenge his father's death. The ways of the two young men diverge, John becoming a medical student, and Bud a surveyor. Later, John hangs out his shingle in a mining camp where he falls in love with a girl who is Bud's sweetheart. The subsequent developments rise to a climax of great power.
