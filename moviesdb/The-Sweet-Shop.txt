The Sweet Shop

 Jarvis Marshall has it all, but after the death of his mother he returns to the village he left fifteen years ago. Among the demons of the past he finds many of his childhood friends, and Katie, the girl who now runs the village sweet shop. As he comes to terms with his past and grows closer to Katie, Jarvis begins to see the possibility of making a brand new start. Of course, getting there will be the hard part. Its a lot easier not to change, after all.
