Touching Lives

 Young adults are missing in Orlando. Gone, vanished, just as they embark on their lives. Police have no hard evidence; a parent's worst nightmare. The lives of four young adults are brought together one night; their lives touch and are forever changed as are the lives of their families. The latest to disappear is the only son of a wealthy land developer. What is the motive? Who will live and who will die? The audience is challenged to judge what ensuing acts are good or evil, just or unjust. What would you do if your child never came home?
