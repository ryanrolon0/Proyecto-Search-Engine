The Runaway Bride

 Mary Fairchild elopes with Dick Mercer and it doesn't take long for Mary to realize she has made a mistake. Her wealthy husband, of short duration, locks her in their apartment to keep her from running away, but a group of gangsters, searching for money manage to enter. She escapes, changes her name and goes to work as a maid for George Blaine, who is also wealthy and single. But the gangsters, thinking she knows where the money is, are on her trail, and a couple of them appear in the mood to frisk her again.
