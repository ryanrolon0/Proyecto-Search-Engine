Trip Around the Union Loop

 This is a very clever film taken from the front of a train moving around the celebrated Union Loop, Chicago. In passing over the loop the elevated train portrays the principal business streets of Chicago, incidentally showing the tall buildings, the massive structures and the various objects of interest which have made Chicago the subject of conversation the world around. Short of an actual trip through the city with a guide you could not gather such a realistic and complete idea of this great city to the onlooker and the strangely real idea which the spectator feels as the train rushes around the loop would almost lead him to believe that he is in company with the photographer and is actually witnessing the scenes which are projected before him. Of all panoramic scenes this is the most realistic ever shown.
