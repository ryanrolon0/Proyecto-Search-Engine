The Fall Guy

 This is the final entry in the Pete Smith Specialty series. Smith pays tribute to stunt man 'Dave O'Brien (I)' (qv), who took many falls and spills (and upon whom objects fell) when he played hapless characters throughout the series. Under the pseudonym "David Barclay," O'Brien also directed many of the Specialties. Clips from previous films highlight O'Brien's work.
