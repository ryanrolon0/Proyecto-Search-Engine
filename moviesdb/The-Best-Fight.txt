The Best Fight

 This is a story of Mischa Weisz who, simply, will not give in and not give up. His is a relentless, but very pragmatic, and positive. It's an inspiration to watch. We tell a very human story about a man's battle with Stage Four pancreatic cancer, a disease that will beat him. For Mischa, it is all about the best fight - which means fighting alongside those you love and for those you love. We go places most people never get to see chemotherapy lab, where they prepare the toxic drugs for patients. And inside a Chinese medicine apothecary, where they prepare different versions of the same drugs. The film shows that western medicine and eastern medicine are increasingly being combined to improve the quality of life of cancer patients.
