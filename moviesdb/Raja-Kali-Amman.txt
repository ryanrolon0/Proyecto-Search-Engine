Raja Kali Amman

 Attractive, naive and simple-minded Devipur-based Meena, her brother, Gopal, and their pet snake, Madan, lives will soon be changed after they look after Devi Maa Durga, who was forced out of her Mandir in a nearby village. Years later, the trio flourish with blessings of the Maa, but find their lives shattered after Meena weds a male named Ramesh, who is not who he claims to be, without prior blessing and permission from the Maa.
