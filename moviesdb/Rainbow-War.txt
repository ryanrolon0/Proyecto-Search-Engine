Rainbow War

 Three kingdoms, floating separately in space, can each see the other nearby kingdoms but have no means to communicate or visit. Each has developed a fanatical obsession for a specific color for clothing, architecture, and even plant life romance and a war of conquest ensues when a means of travel between the kingdoms is abruptly found.
