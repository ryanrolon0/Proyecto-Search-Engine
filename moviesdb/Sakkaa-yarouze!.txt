Sakkaa yarouze!

 After a long day at the office, a young man finally returns to his apartment. Just as he's starting to fall asleep, there is a knock at the door and another man enters the apartment saying "let's play soccer!" Despite his protests of being tired, the office worker finds himself standing in the middle of a deserted train station at 3 playing, and enjoying, a game of soccer.
