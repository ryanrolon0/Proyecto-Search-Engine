The Mount Nebo Chicken Fry

 A short comedy about Josie, an awkward tomboy whose mother is forcing her into the Little Miss Hen beauty pageant when all she really wants is to enter the chicken catching competition. Although the story is a quirky comedy, it is essentially about family, love, and acceptance. The story is inspired by Arkansas life, specifically the real-life Mount Nebo Chicken Fry, which is held annually in Dardanelle.
