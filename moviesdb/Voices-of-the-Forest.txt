Voices of the Forest

The locals took their battle to the highest level and drove out the developers.Since then, the community have organized themselves to conserve their mangroves, with everyone taking part in making decisions that also improve their livelihoods. Now the warriors of 20 years ago are passing the baton to a new generation. How do they see their future?
