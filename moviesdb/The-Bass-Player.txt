The Bass Player

 From the depths of suicide and depression to the heights of new beginnings, marriage proposals, and homecomings. The Bass Player explores Niall McKay's relationship with his Jazz musician father, Jim, who in the 1970's raised his two young sons on his own in Dublin. This film questions what is means to be a son, a husband and a father.
