The Buffalo Soldiers

 This documentary reveals the little-known exploits and heroism of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments of the U.S. Army, composed of colored (black) troops. These troops, nicknamed "Buffalo Soldiers" by their Indian enemies, protected settlers, fought Indians, suffered racial discrimination, and pacified a great deal of the American West after the Civil War. Veterans of these units also distinguished themselves in combat during the Spanish-American War. The film begins and ends with footage of the July 25, 1992 dedication ceremony for the Buffalo Soldier monument at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
