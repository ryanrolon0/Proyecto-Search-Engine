The Wild Heart

 A re-editing of _Gone to Earth (1950)_ (qv) after a disagreement and court case between director 'Michael Powell (I)' (qv) and producer 'David O. Selznick' (qv). Selznick's changes are mainly prologue. (2) Adding scenes explaining things, often by putting labels or inscriptions on them. (3) Adding more close-ups of Jennifer Jones. He also deleted a few scenes that he felt weren't dramatic enough. Sadly some of these were major plot points so the story doesn't make as much sense as the original. In his autobiographies, Powell claimed that Selznick only left about 35 mins of the original film. In fact there's a lot more than that. About 2/3 of the original remains.
