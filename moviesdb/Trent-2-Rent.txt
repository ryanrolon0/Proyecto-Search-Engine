Trent 2 Rent

 Trent splits up with his girlfriend Helen. With nowhere to go he moves in with his friend Joey. It does not take long however before Trent figures out how Joey is managing to make a living - this is especially important to Trent as he is not only loveless and homeless but jobless as well. Growing more and more disillusioned at being broke Trent is forced to make a choice, and so he is drawn into the mysterious world of the male sex trade.
