The Caravan Trail

 Arriving to see his friend the Marshal, Eddie finds him murdered and Joe King, his henchman and crony Judge in control of the town. When he catches three men robbing the bank, he gives them a chance to go straight by making them his deputies. Still outnumbered, it gets worse when one of the new Deputies becomes a double-crosser.
