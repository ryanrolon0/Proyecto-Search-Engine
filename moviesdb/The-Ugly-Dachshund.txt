The Ugly Dachshund

 Fran Garrison's all in a tizzy because her prize Dachshund, Danke, is having pups, and she has hopes of one of the pups becoming a champion. But at the vet's, her husband Jim is talked into letting Danke wetnurse a Great Dane pup that's been abandoned by his mother. And Jim wants to keep the Great Dane. But Brutus has this problem he's too big to be a lapdog. But when Fran ridicules Brutus one too many times, Jim's got a plan to prove to everyone (and Fran) that a great dane can be far more than just an ugly dachshund.
