The Sadistic Hypnotist

 An unknown man sits alone in a cinema watching a movie. The movie is about Sylvester, a man who is kidnapped in a semi-conscious state by Wanda and her lover Greta from a car crash. They tie up him up in their bed. Wanda then hypnotizes him and has him whipped. Soon enough, she hypnotizes one of her women - the lesbian Zelda - to rape him. Greta then rapes him herself until her jealous lover Wanda catches her. Finally, an escaped mental patient breaks in and sets Sylvester free. Both men find Wanda's LSD stash and drug the women. When Sylvester tries raping Wanda, she manages to once again hypnotize him and then The Maniac, who is taken back to his institution. Wanda erases Sylvester's memories and sets him free. The man from the cinema has his car crashed and it is hinted it is now his fate to be kidnapped by Wanda and Greta.
