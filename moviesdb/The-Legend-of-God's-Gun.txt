The Legend of God's Gun

 A gun-slinging preacher returns to the debaucherous town of Playa Diablo seeking revenge from the notorious scorpion-venom drinking bandito El Sobero - lead outlaw and number one bad guy. El Sobero and his band of bad banditos are also returning to Playa Diablo seeking their own revenge against the town sheriff. With the Bounty Hunter dragging up slowly behind there is sure to be a confrontation of Biblical proportions as they all meet in the circle of death.
