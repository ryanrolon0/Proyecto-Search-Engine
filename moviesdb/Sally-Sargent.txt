Sally Sargent

 Sally Sargent is a beautiful, talented high school student, the adopted daughter of a U.S. Senator. Her life seems rich and full on the face of it; but she has an even fuller, and much more exciting life under the code name G-16. Sally Sargent is a secret agent, dedicated to fighting organized crime. Her friend, Rick, can't understand why Sally wears an alarm clock around her neck and runs away every time it goes off. Little does he know, the "clock" is really a secret radio hot-line. It goes off yet again, during a pep rally. Her father's assistant, Blake Jameson, is calling to warn her that Rico Stark is in town, and may want revenge against her, her father and Boris Bartok, the monster movie actor; all of them were responsible for sending the gangster to prison. Jameson is right; at that moment Stark and his stooge, Blaster, have Bartok and a girl Blaster mistook for Sally Sargent, tied up in Bartok's home.
