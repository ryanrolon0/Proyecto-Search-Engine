The Best of Film Noir

 Uses over 30 film clips and interviews about the tough guys and the femme fatales to illustrate the aspects of the film noir genre. Jeffrey Wells discusses _Big Sleep, The (1946)_ (qv), _Touch of Evil (1958)_ (qv), _Kiss Me Deadly (1955)_ (qv), _D.O.A. (1950)_ (qv), _Out of the Past (1947)_ (qv), _Against All Odds_, _Laura (1944)_ (qv), and _Kiss of Death (1947)_ (qv).

In films from the early 1940s to the present day, they entertain us with intrigue, conflict, and lust.
