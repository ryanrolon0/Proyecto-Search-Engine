The Shadow People

 An average teenage girl named Bethany Ryder becomes haunted by demonic visions and shadow-like beings during the night, after her wake from a 9-month coma. She soon finds out, through the means of a prophecy from the Book of Satan that she is carrying a baby to be condemned as the Anti-Christ. Bethany, along with the help of her friends, must find a way to prevent its birth, as well as the visions which soon become more real - in the form of Shadow People. From the director of The Artist comes a story of light and darkness, and one girl's incredible story of salvation and damnation.
