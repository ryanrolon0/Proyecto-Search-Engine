The Christmas Blessing

 Nathan Andrews, a medical resident, goes back home to his small town after he loses a teenager on the operating table. He joins his dad and his mechanic's business and becomes a basketball coach to some youths. Here he meets Charlie and Meghan. This is based on a novel by Donna VanLiere and a continuation of "The Christmas Shoes." Meghan is trying to start up a day care business for single, working mothers and Charlie is ill. All their lives are connected and Nathan meets someone from his past. After loosing a teenage boy on an operating table he promised he would save, Dr. Nathan Andrews returns to his hometown for the holidays. His visit is a bitersweet one, overshadowed with memories of the mother he lost 18 years earlier on Christmas Eve. This is also compounded by the fact that his father seems to want to forget she even existed. Nathan accepts a coach's position at a local elementary school where he meets a young teacher named Megan and also becomes close with a young boy named Charlie. Throughout the movie, events unfold, both good and bad, that ultimately leave Nathan questioning weather or not he did the right thing by coming home. But in the end, everything comes together (aided by a chance meeting with a special someone from Nathan's past), making this a Christmas filled with love, happiness, acceptance, forgiveness. . . . . and shoes.
