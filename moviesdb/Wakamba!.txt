Wakamba!

 A hunter of the Wakamba tribe in central-east Africa desires a bride and goes to a tribal elder to obtain the hand of his daughter. The father demands elephant tusks as payment. On his first trip, the hunter's bow breaks and he returns to the village empty-handed. He obtains a new bow, specially prepared by the high priest, and he and a friend set out. They wander far from the village following tracks that take them to unexplored land. They are tracking a huge elephant and become fearful as they notice the animals around them do not run away as do the animals in their regular hunting grounds. They kill the huge elephant and take his tusks. The hunters now become more frightened as the animals around them are now restless and aggressive...and a large herd of elephants are roaming the fields.
