The Marriage of the Thames and the Rhine

 A hand drawn animation, it is an investigation into the historical and geographical relationship between Germany and England. Central characters in the narrative are Hermes, in the form of a seal, and Pegasus the mythological horse, both bearing witness to the voyage of the imagination, unhindered by the straight jacket of history and time. The animation has a dual meaning; it is both symbolic meditation on a journey into the unknown through the eyes of Pegasus and the seal, both hoping to heal wounds and create a sense of unity in their universe and also an exploration of the geographical history of the Thames and Rhine, which 10,000 years ago formed one single river.
