The Battle of Love's Return

 After a series of mishaps, a young man is fired from his job for failing to deliver a package. He goes on a journey to find himself, encountering various characters including a priest and the owner of a pornographic bookstore, who are seen in black and white interview segments. Poor Abercrombie is the poster boy for nerdness. He doesn't relate well to people, others goof on him and make fun of him and he is, by and large, pretty beaten down by life. However, one day he comes across the girl of his dreams working in a donut shop, and determines to overcome his geekiness and get her.
