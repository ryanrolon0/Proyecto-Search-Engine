Waah! Tera Kya Kehna

 Kishan Oberoi (Shammi Kapoor) has three sons Dilip (Shakti Kapoor), Ashish (Rana Jung Bahadur), and Raj (Govinda). While Dilip and Ashish are married, Raj is in love with Meena (Preeti Jhangiani). Kishan does not trust his two elder sons, but trusts Raj, and Raj in turn, is devoted to his dad. One day Raj loses his mind in an accident, and the two elder brothers begin a conspiracy that includes the death of their dad, and the disinheritance of their brother Raj, by declaring him mentally incompetent. Raj mysteriously disappears, and Kishan falls off a building; Murari (Kader Khan), a greedy employee of the Oberoi family, brings in a look-alike of Raj, namely Banne Khan (also Govinda), and his wife, Salma Khan (Raveena Tandon), who poses as his nurse, so that Banne Khan and Murari both rule over the Oberoi family, and reap the benefits.
