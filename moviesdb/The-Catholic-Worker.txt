The Catholic Worker

 The Catholic Worker is a controversial social outreach group started in the 1930's in New York by Dorothy Day. Steadfast in their beliefs, they strive to see the end of militarism in all it's forms, redistribution of wealth, and the elimination of the domination systems put in place by capitalism and greed.
