Vincent & Lucian

 Vincent & Lucian is a tale about becoming your highest creative self. In the Faustian tradition, Vincent meets an enigmatic and highly expressive character named Lucian. They have a meeting of the minds in which a deal is offered. If Vincent enters into this agreement, he is promised to be one of the truly enlightened artists of his time. The offer also includes being praised by the public and his peers, honored by women and financially rewarded for his work. It seems good enough, although things aren't always what they seem, especially in this tale.
