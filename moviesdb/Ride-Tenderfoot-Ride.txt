Ride Tenderfoot Ride

 Overly shy cowboy Gene inherits a meat-packing plant, then faces stiff competition from snooty Ann Randolph, rival owner determined to do him in. Because his father had once loaned Belmont the money to go into the meat-packing business, Gene Autry (Gene Autry), often awkward but never shy, inherits the Belmont Packing Company. Donald Gregory (Warren Hull) hopes to convince Gene to sell his interests to Ann Randolph (June Storey) of the rival Randolph Company. Gregory, who has intentions of marrying Ann, promises Gene he will combine the two companies but really means to dissolve Autry's company in order to pay lower prices for beef from the local cattlemen. Gene destroys the contract when he discovers Gregory's ruse and the battle to win cattle contracts then begins.
