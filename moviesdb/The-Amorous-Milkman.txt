The Amorous Milkman

 Randy Milkman Davey bites off more than he can chew when he starts to deliver more than pints of milk to some of the bored housewives on his route. In a short space of time he finds himself engaged to two different women; on the receiving end of a bad beating from the local gangster whose girlfriend has been two-timing him with Davey; and finally he ends up in court on a rape charge when an irate husband comes home unexpectedly and discovers Terry and his wife in a compromising situation.
