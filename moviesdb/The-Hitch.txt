The Hitch

 It's a nice day and while the neighbourhood is stirred up by the horrible deeds of a serial killer, a student of psychology tries to hike across Australia. He's lucky as he gets picked up soon. Knowing the dangers of hitchhiking, he looks scared when the driver suddenly takes a different road. Nothing happens though, he only goes to a shop to return with some ice cream. The ride goes on well, until the hitchhiker notices an article about a serial killer in the newspaper. On page 7 there's a photograph of the 'madman'.
