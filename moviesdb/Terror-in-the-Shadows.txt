Terror in the Shadows

 Five years ago, Christine went after the baby she gave up for adoption, claiming he'd been stolen, and wound up killing Alex Williams' wife and the baby the Williams' had adopted. Now, Alex has remarried to a woman with a young son and when Christine escapes from a mental institution, she heads straight for Alex, looking for revenge. A woman (Walker) who is mentally ill, had a baby years ago. Her family feeling that it would be in the child's best interest, decided to give it up for adoption. Feeling that her baby had been taken from her, she sought the people who adopted her baby to get it back. When the husband (McCloskey) came home, he found his wife and the baby dead, and the woman clutching her dead baby. She would be sent to a mental hospital. A few years later, she escapes, and all she can think of is getting her baby back. The man who adopted her baby has since remarried a single mother (Francis), and still lives in the same house. When she gets there, she assumes that her son, is her baby. So she gets a job at her coffee shop waiting for an opprtunity, while her husband, upon learning of her escape, is dreading what is she going to do, cause in her mind he stole her baby.
