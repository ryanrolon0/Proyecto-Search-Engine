Slightly Tempted

 Confidence man Professor Ross is released from prison and goes to Knoxton where his daughter Judy lives. She has told everyone, including her fiancEe Jimmy Duncan, that her father has been exploring in South America. Civic leaders ask him to lecture at a gala reception. Because Jimmy needs money to finance a toy train factory, Ross ends his lecture with a sales talk about the valuable Iridium mines he found in South America. Ethelreda Knox, big-time toy manufacturer, wants to get a monopoly on the Iridium stock, while Gentleman Jack and The Duchess, a pair of slick crooks, also want to chisel in on the deal. Ross gets the swindlers and civic leaders to deposit $60,000 in the bank and he finances Jimmy's factory with the funds. Feeling somewhat "taken", Gentleman Jack and The Duchess rob the bank, but with the help of his crony Peter, Ross sees to it that the pair leave town holding an empty bag. Ross reimburses the locals and suggests a merger of the factories owned by his bride-to-be Eltelreda and his future son-in-law Jimmy.
