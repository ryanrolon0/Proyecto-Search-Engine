The Closure Myth

 The Closure Myth tells the story of Aba Gayle, a woman whose daughter was stabbed to death in 1980, yet who now visits the murderer on death row and acts as an advocate on his behalf. By tracing Aba Gayle's dramatic transformation from before her daughter's murder to the present, and chronicling the emotional ordeal that she encounters as Douglas Mickey's execution nears, The Closure Myth tells a powerful story of forgiveness and articulates an often overlooked perspective in the death penalty debate.
