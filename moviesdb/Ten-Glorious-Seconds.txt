Ten Glorious Seconds

 Albert is in the last stages of Alzheimer's. His wife Josie is aware that time is running out for him and for them. She hopes that, as can occasionally happen, Albert may once again receive and return an emotional signal - long after the loss of his verbal language. Whatever she does and says appears to have no impact on him. But we understand that Albert is struggling with his memory and trying to figure out the identity of his daily visitor. We understand that Albert is everything to Josie; but what is Josie to Albert? We finally bear witness to the intensity which is their love as their parallel lives merge for just Ten Glorious Seconds.
