Use Your Delusion

 A dark surreal comedy about 4 foreign contestants who venture to Japan to compete in a karaoke tournament. Use Your Delusion is a film that spoofs the identity crisis that the traditional music industry and it's shallow value system is facing today as the digital age threatens its traditional hegemony. Faced with the reality of plummeting CD sales, big time music producer Phil Dutton starts a karaoke tournament in Japan broad-casted through the Internet in the hopes of capturing the digital market. But subsidiary to the event are its foreign contestants. Ridden with split personalities and delusions of grandeur, our contestants take us on an absurd journey as the audience is left questioning their true identities.
