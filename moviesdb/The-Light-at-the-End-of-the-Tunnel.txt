The Light at the End of the Tunnel

 The Light at the End of the Tunnel is a video-art film that stands up to make a statement about the disappearance of the Norman French dialect spoken in Jersey. The film shows the train journey between terminals in Gatwick Airport, the main airport connection between Jersey and the UK. Travelling in this train with people from different places of the world, the Jersey local dialect is dying in silence. Is there a light at the end of this tunnel?
