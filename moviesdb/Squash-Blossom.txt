 It is memory about my family and me from 2004 to 2006. The record of the sequence of times focusing on my younger sister who was preparing for university entrance examination explores the relationship with new point of view in the course of being transferred to a film. This film is a life story about agony of dancing art and current situation of dancing education of Korea in addition to family that was carefully observed from different angles as a teacher, dance composer, dancer and elder sister who teaches her sister, a prospective student in dancing department in a university. Two angles in the film finally reach into a dancing performance for a mixture spot through repetitive collisions.
