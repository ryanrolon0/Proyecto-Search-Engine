Tweet and Sour

 Sylvester Cat tries to catch Tweety Bird in Granny's farm house, but Granny catches Sylvester and warns him if anything ever happens to Tweety, she will have Sylvester turned into violin strings. A one-eyed orange tabby makes off with Tweety, and Sylvester must rescue the canary to avoid being sent by Granny to the violin string factory. Granny, frustrated with Sylvester's constant pursuits of Tweety Bird, gives the puddy tat an ultimatum on the canary, it's off to the violin string factory! She even punctuates the warning with a mimicking of "The Funeral March." While a sulking and intimidated Sylvester complies, an orange tabby cat (complete with a patch over its right eye) grabs the bird for his own meal. Sylvester must save Tweety, not out of altruism but to save his own skin. After a back-and-forth chase, Sylvester finally staves off the orange tabby by blowing him up in Granny's chimney (by way of a lighted TNT candle tied to a balloon). However, all's not well for Sylvester...just as he's putting Tweety back in the cage, Granny enters and, thinking he was after the bird again, scolds the puddy tat. "Aw, what's the use, she'll never believe me!" cries Sylvester as he falls into the violin case.
