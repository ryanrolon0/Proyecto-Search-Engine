The Reason We Dance

 Two scientists decide to try and calculate the reason people dance. As they observe dance and listen to music, they become more and more frustrated in trying to find the answer. The more into their research they get, the more the music becomes to overtake them. Finally, they give up on their calculations of the reason we dance and begin dancing themselves. The film shows the separation of science and art through color and motion, comedy and sternness.
