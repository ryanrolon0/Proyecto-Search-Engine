Putty Tat Trouble

 Tweety Bird is shoveling out his nest atop a city pole after a snowstorm and is spotted by Sylvester Cat and a one-eyed orange tabby, who fight over Tweety. Tweety runs into a cellar where he befriends a wooden dunking bird. The two cats then chase Tweety into a park and onto a sheet of ice covering a pond. Tweety cuts a circle around the cats so that they fall into the freezing water and become bedridden with cold.
