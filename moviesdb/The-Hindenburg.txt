The Hindenburg

 This documentary series tells the story of the development and use of the airship, lighter than air vehicles such as blimps and more rigid designs. The film documents their invention, their use in World War As an observational and bombing platform, the development of a potentially prosperous passenger trade and how this all ended with a series of accidents in various countries culminating in the spectacular Hindenburg explosion.
