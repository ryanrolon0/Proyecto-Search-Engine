Promises, Promises...

 What happens when a luxurious yacht sails into Killaragh harbour and an impeccably dressed denim-clad Yankee walks through the town? He's an American with pockets full of money and an agenda. A fifty-year-old love story comes to a final close and a new love blossoms as the people learn the power of humour, passion, love and the American dollar.
