Preventive Warriors

 Preventive Warriors examines George W Bush's foreign policy -- specifically in the National Security Strategy of 2002. The NSS states that the US reserves the right to attack any nation that poses an imminent threat to the US or its interests. The film focuses on terrorism, rogue states, weapons of mass destruction, and how the United States' actions may impact the rest of the world.
