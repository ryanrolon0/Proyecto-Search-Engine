Temüjin

 You're trapped inside the Stevenson Museum - unable to speak or remember who you are. In the chief exhibit - the Capricorn collection, artifacts from the tomb of Genghis Khan - your best hope is to be found spirit from the court of Temujin (a.k.a. Genghis Khan), trapped inside the Capricorn head. You embark on a series of quests and tests to regain your identity and uncover the plots underlying the calm surface of the museum.
