Psychotropica

 A confused and tormented young man (known only as "The Patient") must relive painful dreams and nightmares on a daily basis. The Patient's "treatment" is overseen by a mysterious and sadistic doctor who is not only forcing these total recall sessions on The Patient, but also testing a mind expanding drug on him called "Psychotropica". As the Patient continues to dive deeper and deeper into the wilds of his subconscious mind he comes to realize many horrible truths and shocking twists.
