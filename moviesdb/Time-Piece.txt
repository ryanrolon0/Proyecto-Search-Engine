Time Piece

 Twelve filmmakers, six from Turkey and six from the United States, come together to take part in this omnibus film. Some approaches literal, others more poetic, each artist reflects upon their own cultural backgrounds through a single short film. American and Turkish representations of Daybreak, Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Twilight and Dark of Night guide us through a cultural exploration of time. The first film to come out of the Full Frame Institute, Time Piece is a testament to lives lived in detail and the constructs that unite us all as human beings.
