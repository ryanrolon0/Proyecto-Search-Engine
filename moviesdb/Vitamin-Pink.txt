Vitamin Pink

 On the Western frontier, the Pink Panther is a traveling vendor of pep pills. He unwittingly sells some pills to a frail criminal, who gains the strength to rob every bank in a nearby town! Thus, the panther is in as much trouble with the law as the robber and must act to apprehend the scoundrel. The Pink Panther is a traveling vendor of a pill that gives a person strength. He finds himself selling his pills first to a dirty old man who goes chasing after a pretty blonde, but then he sells his pills to a man who seems to be frail, but it turns out he's a bank robber. The pills give him the strength he needs to rob the first three of four banks, and by feeding the pills to his horse, can get away from the posse of sheriff's deputies trying to catch him. The Sheriff of the town makes him a sheriff's deputy, and he either has to accept the job and catch the robber himself, or he is as good as an accomplice. Before robbing the fourth bank, the robber runs out of pills, and tries to get more from the panther by gunpoint. The panther give him a bottle of pills that are de-vitamin pills. They make the robber so frail that he can't even open the door to the bank, and gets pushed down by a child. This gives the chance for our panther hero to arrest the robber and throw him in jail.
