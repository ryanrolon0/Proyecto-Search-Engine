Psych-o-cysts

 Ensemble piece that takes place in NYC and suburban New Jersey featuring characters of struggling and alienated artists. All the characters have deep obsessions and fetishes which enable them to have borderline psychosis. Part political satire, part post-modern critique on pretentious artists living on the East Coast.
