Susanna Pass

 The bad guys dynamite a fish hatchery. They're trying to put the hatchery out of business so they can get possession of oil underneath the lake. Roy is a game warden investigating the dynamiting. Songs include the title, "A Good, Good Mornin',"Brush Those Tears From Your Eyes," and "Two-Gun Rita." Game Warden Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers) finds the remains of a slaughtered fawn which has been killed by two prison escapees, Bob Oliver (Robert Bice) and Del Roberts (Douglas Fowley.) He finds the sheriff of Susanna Pass is sick and has to take on the task of tracking them down himself, and gets more hindrance than help from ex-bullfighter Carlos Mendoza (Martin Garralaga) and his daughter Rita (Estelita Rodriguez.) Roy checks with local newspaper owner Martin Masters (Robert Emmett Keane)who professes ignorance of the whereabouts of the hunted men, though he is actually in cahoots with Roberts. The latter shows up after Roy leaves and tells Masters he has knifed Bob and left him for dead in the woods. The two have a scheme for dynamiting the lake and hatchery property for the oil underneath, and disposing of the property owner Russell Masters (Francis Ford), Martin's brother, and taking title of the property. At the inquest, after the murder of Russell, Martin is surprised to find that a recent will made by Russell, has left the property to his assistant Kay "Doc" Parker (Dale Evans.)
