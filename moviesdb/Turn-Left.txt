Turn Left

 Three hit men and a young recruit come out of hiding to do one final job that promises to be a huge payday. Their last hit, which was a setup, went totally wrong. Their new assignment comes from a mysterious Vegas casino owner, who has now encountered severe legal problems. They are instructed to blow up his casino without any casualties, in order to extinguish all evidence the FBI may be searching for. Their payoff will come only after the job is complete, which may be their biggest gamble ever.
