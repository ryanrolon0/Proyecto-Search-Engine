The Baron's Bear Trap

 There is no reliable documentation that any film bearing the title The Baron's Bear Trap was ever produced by L-KO or distributed by Universal at this time. It is another bogus entry from the error-ridden pages of Richard E. Braff's Silent Short Film Working Papers; most likely it is the same film as The Baron's Bear Escape (1914) q.v.
