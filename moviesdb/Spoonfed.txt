Spoonfed

 On any given beautiful day at a Beverly Hills cafE, patrons converge, converse, and chuckle over a beverage, entrEe and desert. At a casual glance, they are just small moments in time over a bowl of tomato soup, a slice of chocolate cake, or a cup of red tea. But from the vantage point of one spoon, there's a whole new insight on modern America. For the spoon, its just another day quirky and somber vision is brought to life by a seamlessly subtle ensemble and tantalizingly ambiguous screenplay by Cole Summers and Mike Cunio . After watching 'Spoonfed', you won't look at a spoon the same way.
