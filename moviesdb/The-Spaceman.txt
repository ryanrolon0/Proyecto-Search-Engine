The Spaceman

 Thomas is obsessed with outer space and the woman next door. Every night he sits in the garden looking up at the stars through his telescope, as well as using it to spy on the object of his affections. One day a new woman moves in downstairs. She seems quite forward. While Thomas works on his plans to make himself worthy of his next door love he can have no idea of the impact his designs will have on the woman downstairs.
