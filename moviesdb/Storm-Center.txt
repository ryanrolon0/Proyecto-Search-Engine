Storm Center

 A small-town librarian is branded as a Communist by local politicians when she refuses to withdraw a controversial book from the library's shelves. Alicia Hull lives for her work as a local librarian and the opportunity it gives to introduce the world of books to the children. When the city council put pressure on her to remove an obviously propagandist treatise "The Communist Dream" from the shelves she refuses on principal. Though she has absolutely no sympathy with such a creed, the council question some of her past activities and she finds herself not just without a job but also branded as a subversive.
