Postelnye stseny

 Seven interconnecting stories that take place in Russian bedrooms. These include a son visiting his complaining bedridden mother, a middle-aged couple bickering, one soldier bullying another in an army barracks, a rich childless housewife picking up the soldier for rough sex while her husband has a tryst with another man arranged by computer, and a wife who asks to be handcuffed to her bed while being videotaped by her lover.
