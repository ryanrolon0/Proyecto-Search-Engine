Saathi

 As children, Suraj and Amar had helplessly watched a police inspector beat their poor father to death by throwing him from a window of a multi-storied building. Amar and Suraj grow up and take to petty crime. It is this that leads them to a gangster named Pasha, and it is here that Amar and Suraj will decide to part ways, for Amar does not want to get involved in any gangland activity especially dealing with illicit drugs, while Suraj wants money and wealth and will do anything to get rich. Their paths will cross again, when Suraj accepts a contract to kill a young drug addict named Vicky from testifying against Pasha and his men. What Suraj does not know is that Vicky is the brother of Asha, the woman Amar has fallen in love with, and will do anything to protect her and Vicky.
