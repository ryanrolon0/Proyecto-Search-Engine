The Computer

 Science-Tone Films, maker of children's educational movies in the 1950s, presents a fantastical look at how computers will one day simplify the lives of all who use them. Our guide for this informative and astounding journey into the future is none other than the Science-Tone Professor himself. Delivering a lesson to Larry and Suzy, two well-mannered grade school students with excellent posture, The Professor foretells a time in the not too distant future when mechanical thinking machines, called "com-pu-tors," will increase our quality of life, send rockets to Mars, and help fight communism.
