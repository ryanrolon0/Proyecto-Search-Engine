Sobrenatural

 A woman sees her best friend murdered before her eyes, and thus becomes very traumatised. Her husband tells her to stay at home, where she discovers a little gris-gris bag. She opens the bag, without knowing it's magical origin and smells a powder. She begins investigating and discovers a strange address who warns her of the dangers of the powder she smell and the dark powers of voodoo. She then meets a psychologist, who becomes interested in her case and the black magic surrounding her. When a mysterious black man appears, and strange things begin to happen, her life turns into a race against time and against a powerful voodoo deity. Dolores Berthier is a well-to-do housewife living with her husband, AndrEs, in an elegant old building in latter-day Mexico City. After Eva, her neighbour and friend, is savagely murdered on her doorstep, Dolores freaks and starts to go delusional. Concerned, AndrEs asks her to meet with a psychiatrist, meanwhile she finds in a book at Eva's the address of Madame Endor, a mysterious sorceress who seeks to aid her, for it seems that, unbeknownst to her, Dolores is entangled in a web of voodoo and black magic. As her kindly doctor tries to figure out what is going on and joins forces with Madame, who finds herself dying, Dolores's marriage starts to come apart at the seams on lieu of certain shocking revelations of murder, treachery and deceit, and an eerie zombie-like figure starts to stalk her luxurious apartment, seeking to settle an old score...
