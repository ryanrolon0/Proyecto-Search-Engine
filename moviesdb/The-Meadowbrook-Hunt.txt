The Meadowbrook Hunt

 "The famous Meadowbrook Hunt Club in full cry. The hounds appear first in the distance hot on the trail, followed by the huntsmen in force. Two high fences are cleared in magnificent style, and the whole scene is full of dash and spirit. This picture is splendid photographically."
