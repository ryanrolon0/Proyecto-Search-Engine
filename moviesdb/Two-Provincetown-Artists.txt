Two Provincetown Artists

 One of the less known features of Provincetown is the artist studios on the second floor of the Post Office. In this documentary two highly accomplished artists speak about their work with uncommon openness. In one scene, Larry Collins sits in his library surrounded by his inspirations and touches on the year he was a combat illustrator in Vietnam and also took photographs of the quieter moments in the camp. In another scene, Jenny Humphreys down the hall, thinks through the orientation of her canvas before rotating it, and then mixes paint with a pallet knife, deep in private thought, before approaching her canvas to paint. Together these two portraits give a very personal, and visually engaging view of two local artists in their studios.
