Pride of the Plains

 Hurley wants to sell wild horses and is trying to get the Wild Game Laws that protect them changed. To get his petition signed, his henchman paints his trained horse to look like the wild horse leader and has it kill a man. Johnny Revere finds traces of paint on a horse and tries to arrest Hurley and his men. But he is captured by the gang and is now slated to be the next victim of the trained horse.
