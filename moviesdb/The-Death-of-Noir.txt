The Death of Noir

 Betrayal, denial, murder and revenge - it seemed like just another Tuesday for Private Detective Jack Carter. But somewhere between the end of one case and the beginning of another, Carter's past catches up to him. Now, sprawled out on the asphalt breathing his last, Carter is faced with his final case through his memories, to find the reason things have gone so terribly wrong. Slowly Carter finds the answers he is looking for, but in this city of shadows, those answers always come just moments too late.
