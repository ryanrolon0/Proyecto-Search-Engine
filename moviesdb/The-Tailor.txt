The Tailor

 A fierce dust storm blankets a vast and infertile desert. From under the sand and debris emerge four figures. Two survive and make their way across the desert, following a thin trail of smoke rising in the distance. Near dead, the mysterious strangers approach the home of Caleb Williams, a humble tailor seeking refuge from his wife's brutal murder. He takes them in and nurses them back to health, suppressing an unsettling recognition of the peculiar wounds marking their backs. In a nearby town, a desperate priest is approached by a familiar stranger. Unable to deny his horrific request, the priest accompanies him into the barren desert. Their journey will reveal not only the truth surrounding the death of the tailor's only love, but the presence of a much greater evil awakened in the desert wind.
