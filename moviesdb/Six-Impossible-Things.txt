Six Impossible Things

 Six Impossible Things' is a story about our beliefs, especially those of children still attempting to understand the world we live in. Growing up, we find ourselves struggling with what we should, can, and don't believe. This system of beliefs we have when we are young is a product of our situation, peers, and parenting, The film is a vision of drama, magic, and reality, re-creating the feeling one would get of reading a story of slipstream fiction, and addressing the situational development of what we believe and don't believe.
