Sy Smith

 An up close look into a live performance of underground soul siren, Sy Smith. Shot at her largest show to date in Santa Monica's famed Temple Bar, we are transported into the front row of one of soul music's hottest international performers. A mixture of funk, hip-hop, jazz, soul and the D.C. based Go-Go music, Sy Smith's music takes us on a roller coaster ride! With commentary by the artist and special performances by soul star Raheem DeVaughn and Emcee E Reece, we are given insight into the world of a truly independent musical mind!
