To the Other Side

 To the Other Side is a portrait of an American expatriate whose fear of imprisonment and belief in socialism compelled him eastward, behind the Iron Curtain. Victor Grossman reflects on his flight across the Danube river, life in East Germany, and political ideology. To the Other Side explores what it means to be a foreigner- to yearn for the familiar and then eventually lose what you loved most about your adopted country.
