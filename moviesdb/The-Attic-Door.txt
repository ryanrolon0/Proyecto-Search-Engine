The Attic Door

 A young brother and sister are forgotten in the vast and lonely landscape of the 19th century American West. Each day, they struggle to keep up the family farm, anxiously waiting for their parents to return. With nowhere to escape, the two siblings are about to discover that they are not entirely alone. As much as they try to deny the truth, something behind the attic door has awakened and they must now face their greatest fear. THE ATTIC DOOR is the story of love, loss, loneliness, and the truth behind childhood fears.
