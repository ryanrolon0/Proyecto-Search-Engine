Till Dad Do Us Part

 Banker Gavin Corbett refuses, unlike his wife Virginia, who would just wait, to stand by as his spoiled daughter Rebecca 'Becky' announces she wants to abandon her medical studies and marry idealistic, unruly environmental activist Dennis Qualintip. Gavin hopes the answer is to match Becky with a dream prince, rising bank executive Brent Fenwick III, whom he makes his protEgE. Alas the boy fears he's wanted as gay boy-toy, while everyone else warms to Dennis.
