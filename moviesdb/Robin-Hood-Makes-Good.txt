Robin Hood Makes Good

 A fox captures a group of squirrels while they're playing at "Robin Hood." The smallest of the bunch, who'd been bullied into playing the villain and thus avoided capture, uses his ingenuity to rescue his friends. This Merry Melody cartoon, "Robin Hood Makes Good," features three squirrels who find a book about the adventures of Robin Hood, and decide to emulate the hero by becoming merry outlaws of the forest. A fox reads the discarded book and decides there is something in it that will provide a meal (or three) for him.
