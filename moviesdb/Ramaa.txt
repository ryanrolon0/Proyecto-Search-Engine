Ramaa

 Snobbish Komal (Ananya Shukla) and her brother, Kunal (Koustov Ghosh); Sameer (Arjun Nandwani) - who is always ready for a snack; and siblings of smart class monitor Riddhi (Ishita Panchal) (Zankhi Pabari) - play a recently released video game 'The Last Battle' on TV. Shortly thereafter, they will be magically and mysteriously transported back in time to a prehistoric island - and will have to fend for themselves against wild animals, deadly gem-seekers, and an ageless, armed and fierce entity called Kaali (Taleb Ibrahim).
