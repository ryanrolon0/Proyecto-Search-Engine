 During an economic recession, a stressed-out middle-class worker is car-jacked by a man who has just robbed a bank. Over-worked, under-paid, and the main provider for his family, the weary worker's warped perspective on life causes him to make decisions that surprise both the criminal and himself. Sadly, the worker would later regret those decisions. Upon reaching their destination, it is revealed that the criminal and the worker are shockingly similar. Unfortunately, this revelation occurs when it is already too late.
