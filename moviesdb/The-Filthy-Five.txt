The Filthy Five

 Johnny Longo is a hopeful boxer who spends the night with Rose, a prostitute who has secretly used her racket connections to further his career. Johnny is up for a role on a local TV series playing a boxer co-starring Rita Roman, a once-famous actress who is now addicted to heroin. Johnny and Rita do not get along at all because of their constant fighting which upsets their acting rehearsals and Johnny's training schedule. Meanwhile, Rose, jealous over Johnny's career, plots with Rita to get him off the TV show by having him take LSD at a party, not realizing that the affects are more than both women will anticipate.
