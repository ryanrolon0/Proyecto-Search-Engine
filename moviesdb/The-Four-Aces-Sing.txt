The Four Aces Sing

 This Universal Musical featurette headlines The Four Aces doing their hits, "Tell Me Why" that was on the Lucky Strike Hit Parade for 13 weeks beginning from Feb. 2, 1952 through April 26,1952 and "Heart of My Heart" which made the Hit Parade for 15 weeks starting on Jan. 9,1954 through April 17, 1954 while never rising above number three on the weekly list. Eve Young/Karen Chandler sings "Hit the Target Baby" and "Positively No Dancing", while Matt Dennis does "That Tired Routine" and The Four Aces wrap it up with Guy Mitchell's 1951 hit---three Hit Parade weeks---"So Long." Universal also tosses in a juggling act called "The Houcs", which was better than the acrobats they often employed in these shorts.
