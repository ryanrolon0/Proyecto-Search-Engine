The Trio of Minuet

 Madolyn, Wesley, and Doh, three children from the town of Minuet, which has dancing (the primary form of communication) but no singing, follow advice of strange old couple Seemore and Melodia, who can sing, and encounter a creature called Susie who sends them on a trip to various singing communities by chasing them into the River Glissando. Seemore and Melodia explain at the beginning that the performers will indeed be singing in order to interpret the dances for the viewer.
