Tomorrow

 Terry is going to be great. He has a lot going for him, his children, friends and opportunity. One thing holds him back. Terry is an addict. One bite and he is powerless. Insanity has been described as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. 'Just one', turns Terry's day insane. Terry will be great...tomorrow
