Sock-a-Bye Kitty

 An alley-cat, plagued with a bad case of insomnia, reads that the eating of a blackbird is a sure cure. He catches the first blackbird that comes along, which happens to be Buzzy the Crow (not to be confused with Walter Lantz's Buzz Buzzard), who not only talks like Rochester but is nearly as smart as Rochester. Buzzy, smart enough not to want to be eaten, convinces the dumb cat that he has better methods of curing his insomnia, and then proceeds to severely punish the cat with a variety of all painful, sleep-inducing tricks.
