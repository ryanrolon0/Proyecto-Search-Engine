Sent Beyond

 This short documentary 'Sent Beyond' is retelling moments in the lives of French-Canadian political exiles transported to Australia in 1840 for their part in an uprising against British rule in Canada. The convicts were imprisoned at Longbottom Stockade, near Sydney. After years in detention they obtained a pardon from Queen Victoria and could work to save and return home, which most did except two who died in Sydney and one Joseph Marceau who settled and made a new life in Australia. Based on the journal of one of the exiles, Francois-Maurice Lepailleur, the film brings the journal's powerful musing about isolation to the screen.
