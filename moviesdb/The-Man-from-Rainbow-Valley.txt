The Man from Rainbow Valley

 Monte Hale, cowboy creator of the popular comic strip featuring "Outlaw", the wild horse,is as fond of the real horse as his thousands of fans are of the comic strip version. When unscrupulous rodeo promoter Colonel Winthrop gets the idea of capturing "Outlaw" and making him a show horse, his niece Kay North tricks Monte into believing she is a writer assigned to do an article on the real horse. With her help, Winthrop's henchmen Tracy and Lafe capture the horse, thus leaving unprotected the colt, "Shadow", and the herd of mares, against the wild animals who attack them when their protector is missing. Furious at the theft of the horse, Monte goes to the Winthrop Rodeo and, with the help of his kid sister, Ginny and Locoweed, an elderly comic-strip fan, rescues the horse.
