The Field Trip

 Richard Digweed is a teacher - bullied by the students in his class, inflicted with a sex ban from his wife Sarah and to top it off he's agreed to a weekend of camping and male bonding with his future slob of a brother in law Buck. Richard just can't be firm or put his foot down to anything or anyone. Buck is an unemployed, carefree manchild who enjoys life and what it has to bring, especially tinned hotdog sausages - and romps with Richard's sister Mel. He's probably Richard's least favourite person in the world. When Buck takes Richard away on his stag trip camping in the Wiltshire countryside, the result is one wacky and weird weekend that neither of them will forget in a hurry.
