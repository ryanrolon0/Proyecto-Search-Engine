This Is My Affair

 Navy Lt. Richard Perry becomes an undercover man out to discover the leaders of a group of well connected men who pull off bank robberies during the McKinley administration (early 20th century). President McKinley asks Lieutenant Richard L. Perry to go underground to identify some obviously very well briefed Mid-Western bank robbers. He infiltrates the gang in St Paul but to try and get to the well-placed informant he finds he is becoming more and more involved in their crimes and with Lil, sister of one of the gang members.
