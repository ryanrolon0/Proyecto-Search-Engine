The Inner Voice

 THE INNER VOICE is the story of one man's mission to become a famous motion picture director. Blind ambition drives him to lose sight of everything and everyone around him - as if he were on a "mission" from "God" - until he loses it all and learns that respect and friendship are the only values that matter.
