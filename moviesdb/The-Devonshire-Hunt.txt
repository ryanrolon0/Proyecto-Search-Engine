The Devonshire Hunt

 This film gives a very comprehensive idea of deer hunting as it is followed by the members of aristocratic society in England. As the scene opens, the deer which are used in the hunt, are shown confined in a paddock. Next comes the meeting of the hunters with the hounds in charge of the whip. Then the start of the hunt, showing the dogs bolting off at full speed, followed by ladies and gentlemen mounted on sturdy thoroughbreds. The next scene shows the deer being released from the covered van and bounding off across the country. The next scene shows the hounds in full cry, and traveling at high speed across the fields and crossing through a break in the hedge, followed by the hunters leaping the hedge, many of them in magnificent style. One hunter however, receives an unintended and nasty fall directly in front of the camera. This scene will create great excitement wherever shown. The end of the picture shows the hounds back at the kennels receiving their feed. The film is very fine throughout. The price of originals from this film is 15 cents per foot net. We can, however, supply an admirable duplicate of shorter length, some of the scenes of minor importance being omitted, at 12 cents per foot.
