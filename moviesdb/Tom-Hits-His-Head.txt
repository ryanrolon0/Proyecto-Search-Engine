Tom Hits His Head

 Tom doesn't usually do too well when his blood needs to be taken. This time it isn't different. He fainted and fell with his head on the floor. It wasn't too bad, he only was a little bit dizzy and went to home soon. The next day, however, trouble begins when Tom enters a tunnel in his car. Suddenly he gets a blackout. The blackouts continue, day after day, examination after examination. When he browses the internet, he learns a new phrase him though. The trouble only gets worse.
