The Cold War

 The subject deals with Europe's problem of economic recovery, following WWII, and the struggle against the expanding pressure by Russia. The film shows that the Communists lost their first test of strength in France when Premier Robert Schuman succeeded in breaking the Communist-agitated strikes. Life in present-day France (1948), with its economic and political stress, is exemplified by a typical Parasian family that wants neither the extreme Left nor the extreme Right. They prefer the middle-of-the-road party led by Robert Schuman. The conclusion is that The Marshall Plan (designed by and named after U. S. Army General George C. Marshall) will stabilize European economics.
