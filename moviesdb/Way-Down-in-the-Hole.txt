Way Down in the Hole

 The ghosts of America's radical past make themselves known in 'Way Down In the Hole.' Enlisting contemporary interviews, archival materials and a propulsive musical score, this short documentary journeys to the heart of one of the most violent episodes in American labor history, the great Colorado Coalfield War of 1913-1914. Indebted as much to Barbara Kopple's 'Harlan County USA,' as to Sam Peckinpah's 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,' the film is a meditation on class struggle, national identity, and violent insurrection, played out across the wild frontier of the industrial American West.
