The Procession

 Two aimless friends, Nick and Hayden, reunite to embark on a seemingly hopeless quest to attend a friend's funeral. Tensions build as they encounter strange circumstances and some even stranger characters. An old high school bully, Trent "The Trigger," and a mysterious man prove to be far more precarious than they are helpful. THE PROCESSION centers on two young men inextricably linked by death and coming to terms with the uncertainty of life.
