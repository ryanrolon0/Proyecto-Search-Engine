Swat the Fly

 Pudgy the Pup is sleeping peacefully; and Betty Boop is happily making batter. But a pesky housefly disturbs their quiet day. Soon Betty is throwing batter everywhere in the house, hoping to catch the fly; but all she does it break her windows, destroy her glass cabinets and splatter the entire house with the gooey mixture. Meanwhile, Pudgy, hoping to catch the fly himself, had jumped into the dough she was rolling. And now he's stuck in it.
