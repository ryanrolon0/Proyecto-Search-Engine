The Rains of Ranchipur

 India. The spoilt and stubborn Edwina Esketh, comes to a small town with her husband. She falls in love with an indian doctor, Dr. Safti. She also meets an old friend of hers, the alcoholic Tom Ransome. An awful earthquake is followed by days of rain. Circa 1938 in India, the wise and astute Maharani of Ranchipur sadly bids adieu to her deceased husband, Maharaj Man Singh Bahadur, and departs to smoke a cigarette privately. Following this there is a condolence meeting with several dignitaries in attendance. Amongst them are Lord Albert Esketh and his wife, Edwina; Thomas alias Tom Ransome, a bounder, a drunk, a womanizer, are some of the titles bestowed on him by Ranchipurans, not to speak of his former affair with Lord Albert's wife, and an on-going affair with an 18 year old American by the name of Fern, daughter of local missionaries; And then there is Hindu Dr. Major Rama Safti - a man who once belonged to the untouchables, was adopted by the Maharaja and his wife, groomed to be a doctor so that he can assist the poor in Ranchipur, which also included his travel to the United States of America, and who is currently involved in an affair with Lady Esketh, much to the chagrin of the Maharani, who has other plans for Rama, and would like Edwina out of the way as soon as possible. Then all their plans and lives are changed when heavy incessant rains pound Ranchipur and the region, followed by massive earthquakes, pollution, and then plague - and even the Caucasians nor the rich can escape the fury of the elements.
