The Persistent Poet

 Algernon Swinburne Higgs is a poor poet. He cannot pay his trifling laundry bill. Instead he reads his new ode to the washer woman, driving her away. He enters an editorial office but he shoots the chute into the street. He encounters an artist, smashing his drawing. He falls into the hands of the police and is sentenced to three months on the rocks. He hides his poem and brings it out when the guard is not looking. The convicts are stunned and the guard knocked senseless. Going into the Warden's office that official pleads for mercy, and accedes to the poet's demand for exchange of striped clothing for his old suit and liberty.
