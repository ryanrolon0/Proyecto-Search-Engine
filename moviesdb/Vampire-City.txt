Vampire City

 The search for the murderer of his father leads Robert Van Helsing to Vienna. There he meets Count Dracula who tells him that Vienna is a good place for Vampires because the people here are that weird, they wouldn't see any difference between a Vampire and a normal person. Together with Dracula's love Isabelle and the lovely Pia they are fighting against the evil Vampire Queen and her lover Morlock who are on their way to rule the world.
