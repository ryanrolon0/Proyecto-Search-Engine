Spills for Thrills

 A behind the scenes look (at Warners) at the life of some of Hollywood's top stunt-people, including Harvey Parry, Allen Pomeroy and Mary Wiggins. This short also incorporates much archive footage taken from Sennett's Keystone Kops to Warner's silent-days Rin-Tin-Tin to the most recent (late 1930s) Warner films in which Parry, Pomeroy and Wiggins had worked.
