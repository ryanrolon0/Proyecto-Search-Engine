Unconquered; Allan Houser and the Legacy of One Apache Family

 Spanning from the 1860's through today, the Houser/Haozous story is a journey exploring the incarceration of a people, growth brought on by freedom, and a family's personal expression of these experiences through art. Recently released as Prisoners of War, Sam and Blossom Haozous' passed down oral traditions of the Apache people to their son Allan Houser. These shared memories molded his artwork, and in turn helped him become one of the 20th Century's most important artists. Allan then passed these same family experiences down to his own sons who are fulfilling their destinies as the next generation of Native American artists. In the end, the American Dream is alive in the strength of this one Apache family's legacy.
