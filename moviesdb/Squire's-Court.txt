Squire's Court

 This is a typical court scene. You see the judge on the bench, the policeman bringing in prisoners, etc. One man who has committed burglary is given a sentence of six months, while a little boy who has stolen a loaf of bread is given a term of ten years -- thus illustrating the usual course of justice. By the use of printed signs, plainly seen in this picture, you can tell just what is transpiring.
