The Golden Spike

 "The Golden Spike" seeks to redress history's omission of the Chinese contribution to the creation of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869 and formed a reliable connection between west and east coasts. The film illustrates the importance of Chinese migration to the construction of one of the most transformative events in U.S. history. It also showcases the lives of Chinese laborers whose contribution was integral to the creation of the railroad.
