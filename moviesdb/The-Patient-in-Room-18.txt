The Patient in Room 18

 Lance is sent to the hospital to recuperate from a nervous breakdown. At the hospital, Sara is his nurse and she still holds a grudge from the last court case. At the hospital, a wealthy patient has just donated $100,000 worth of radium to be used on his skin problem. But late that night, he is murdered and the radium is stolen. Everyone has a motive except for Sara and Lance as they were looked in his room during the murder. As the bodies pile up, Sara and Lance try to solve the case as Foley is clueless. In the first of two films, followed by "Mystery House", in which Ann Sheridan played Mignon Eberhardt's Nurse Sarah Keate character (played previously at Warner's by Aline MacMahon and by Jane Darwell at 20th Century-Fox), private detective Lance O'Leary, her off-and-on boyfriend, is recuperating from a nervous breakdown in Room 18 of the Thatcher Hospital. Wealthy patient Frank Warren is murdered in a nearby room, and a valuable supply of radium, used in his treatment, is stolen. Lane suspects Warren's son, Jim Warren, when he discovers the father had turned him down on a loan for his failed business. And Jim's nurse sweetheart, Maida Day, is also suspected by Lance. While Police Inspector's Foley and Donahue are investigating the Warren murder, they discover Dr. Arthur Lethany murdered, and his body concealed in the closet in Warren's room. Lane thinks the missing radium holds the answer to both killings and, after Madia finds it and gives it to Lance, he places it where he knows the guilty person will attempt to steal it again. His plan is to make sure the killer is successful in the attempt.
