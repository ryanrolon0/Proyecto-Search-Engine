The Bungalow Craze

 The four wives of four indulgent and patient husbands are bitten by the 'bungalow bug' and contract the bungalow fever. The disease seems contagious, for the husbands, by contract, are also stricken. The wives have daily conferences, at which they exhibit their plans and discuss their localities. The husbands, too, unknown to each other and to their wives, each determines to give his wife as a surprise a bungalow. A dashing, rich widow, preparing to go abroad for a protracted sojourn, wishing to dispose of some of her property before she goes, moves into one of her own houses in a quiet little street, where her rich costumes, automobiles, servants, etc., are looked upon with suspicion by the modest, unpretending women of the neighborhood. The dashing widow advertises her suburban bungalow. The advertisement meets the gaze of the husbands above referred to and causes them to surreptitiously visit the comely widow. In an effort to make a sale, the husbands separately are requested to call on the widow, with a view to arranging the price. Each in turn does so, and they are seen entering the home of the widow and departing mysteriously in her sumptuous car to view the property. The husbands are finally seen by their wives, an a series of complications ensue, which are funny.
