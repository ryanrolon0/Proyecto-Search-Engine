The Wave

 The Wave is a documentary short film that attempts to understand surfing and surf culture in terms of history, physical science, psychology, and dramatic performance. Featuring numerous interviews with renowned surfing experts from around the world, the film paints a portrait of the sport that is decidedly more gripping and complex than even surfers themselves might expect.
