The Big Muddy

 Alex is making the big move to Seattle from Memphis. He's said goodbye to girlfriend Monica and he's on his way that is, until his truck with all of his stuff gets repossesed. That means he has to stick around for a while longer, but then he meets the beautiful Vanessa. Should he cancel his trip to be with her?
