Tanks for Nothin'

 A 1950s American tomboy is enthralled with her older brother's Christmas gifts. The animated short begins in black and white with a stylized 50s aesthetic. She's caught up in a series of vivid color fantasies, inspired by her brother's boyish/adventurous gifts. The story takes a turn when she opens her own lackluster gifts, a very 'girly' tea set, doll and buggy. She responds to her brother's jeering by once again appropriating one of his gifts in order to carry out her imagined vengeance.
