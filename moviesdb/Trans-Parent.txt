Trans Parent

 Zoe is 14. The teenage years are complicated enough but for Zoe things are increasingly tough. She and her transsexual father Robert have just moved to the city where Robert hopes to start over as Diana. She struggles both to accept her father's confidence to appear in public as a woman as well as trying to fit in at her new school. When a rebellious girl befriends Zoe she finds herself trapped between two worlds which seem to be impossible to combine.
