The Muppets Take Manhattan

 The Muppets graduate from college and decide to take their senior revue on the road. They hit the streets of Manhattan trying to sell their show to producers, finally finding one young and idealistic enough to take their show. After several mishaps and much confusion, things begin to come together for them. After graduating college, the Muppets travel to Manhattan to have someone produce their musical "Manhattan Melodies". When it doesn't happen, the gang splits up. Kermit makes friends with Jenny and Piggy is jealous, thinking that Kermit found a new girl. Now Rowlf is a vet secretary, Fozzie's living in a cave, and Piggy is working at a hotel with her partner, but apparently they get fired and now Piggy lives next door to where Kermit works at Pete's with Jenny. When Jenny and Kermit find producer-in-training Ronny Coleman, he promises to produce their show. The gang returns to Manhattan, but after getting hit by a car in joy, Kermit gets amnesia and now finds work making ads with other frogs. When Kermit is found at Pete's, they try to restore his memory.
