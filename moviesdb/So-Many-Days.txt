So Many Days

 In the Deep South, 1963. Bennie Patrick doesn't belong here. A stand-up comic from Chicago, he has been thrust into the south by fate and a contract with That Sordid Little Story, a family band on a tour below the Mason-Dixon Line. Tonight is just one more night to survive. Do the set and hope you don't get killed.
