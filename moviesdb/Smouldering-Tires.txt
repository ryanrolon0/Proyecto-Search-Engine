Smouldering Tires

 This two-reel short is actually Chapter 5 of a 12-film series called 'The Fighting Hearts." The series had the same cast but with different non-episodic stories in each short. In this one, the hero's enemies have tossed a wrench into his printing press and stripped the gears. So, naturally, to replace the gears he decides to enter an auto-race. He builds a car that will not turn over by building two cars attached by their roofs, with a driver (one always upside down) in each car. The car often turns over but half of it always has the rubber-meeting-the-road.
