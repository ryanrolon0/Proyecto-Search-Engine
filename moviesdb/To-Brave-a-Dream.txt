To Brave a Dream

 A fascinating film that sheds new light on the attempt of devout Christian Americans from Maine to turn the holy land into an American colony in the 19th century. Led by the charismatic Reverend George Jones Adams, they immigrated with their wooden homes to the Holy Land to await the second coming of Christ. Ancestors of the original settlers are interviewed in this film that details a remarkable and forgotten footnote in American history.
