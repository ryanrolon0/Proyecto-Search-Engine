The Draft

 `The Draft', is a hilarious mini creature feature in the spirit of the old 1950's sci-fi `B-Movies'. Our story begins in Shannon Airport, as American military planes off-load a mysterious cargo, destined for a secret location in Ireland. On route, one of the military trucks, drops its cargo amongst the treacherous hillsides of Cavan. The box smashes, releasing a silver canister that ends up on `Makeout Point', killing two young lovers in their car. From here all hell breaks loose. Who is the mysterious Professor Wigand, and what is his role in these ghastly events? Can our young hero, Garda Cormac Mc Kee, crack the case and save his girl, the beautiful but challenged, Katie Hamelton? What has the sinister General Earl Mc Carthy got in store for our heroes? And just what in the hell is `The Draft'?...
