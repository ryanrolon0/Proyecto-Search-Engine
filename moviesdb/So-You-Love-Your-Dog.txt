So You Love Your Dog

 Despite the fact that during the war, Joe McDoake's dog Dusty did everything wrong including giving information to the enemy, Joe brings him home with him. Dusty continues his dumb ways as a civilian with such playful tricks as helping a burglar, derailing trains and bringing strange people into the house. Joe and Dusty are drafted into the Korean War where more adventures await them.
