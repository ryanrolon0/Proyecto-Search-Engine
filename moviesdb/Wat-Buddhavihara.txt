Wat Buddhavihara

 Phramaha Payom is a Thai monk in the Wat Buddhavihara temple in Berlin-Wittenau. He speaks about his experiences he had with German culture since he arrived in Berlin a couple of years ago and about the very special relationship of the Thai people to the King of Thailand. When he speaks one can understand some of the problems Thai people have to face when they arrive in a country with such a different culture to their own.
