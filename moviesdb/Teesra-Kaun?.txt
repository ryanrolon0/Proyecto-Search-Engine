Teesra Kaun?

 Three Bollywood-stricken, Calcutta-based slackers, Vijay Verma (Chunky Pandey), Bingo Nagpurkar (Satish Shah), and Khoka Ganguli (Rakesh Bedi), board the Howrah-Bombay Mail, to watch a cricket match, and to meet Mithun Chakraborty. After boarding, the trio consume considerable alcohol. Vijay introduces himself to two other passengers, C.K. Kadam (Amol Palekar), and Manjula Saxena (Ritu Parna), as he finds the latter very attractive. He wants to change his seat to sit next to her, but the passenger, Pankaj Nigam, occupying it, refuses to leave, leading to a physical altercation, which ends in Vijay being asked to return to his seat. During a stopover, Pankaj departs, and when the train resumes its journey, Mr. Kadam finds Manjula's dead body. The police begin their investigation, and interrogate Pankaj and Vijay, and not only discover that Pankaj is not who he claims to be, but there is also a third unknown suspect.
