Summer Exhibition

 Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen guides viewers through the Royal Academy of Arts' Summer Exhibition 2006. Every year, thousands of artists submit works to the largest open exhibition in the world, hoping to follow in the footsteps of Turner, Constable and Hockney. Entries are anonymous, so having a famous face won't help comedian and artist Vic Reeves as he puts his creative credentials on the line.
