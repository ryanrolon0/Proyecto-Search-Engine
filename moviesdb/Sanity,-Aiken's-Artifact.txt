Sanity, Aiken's Artifact

 An artifact is discovered in the Middle East that aids a scientist in creating a serum that unlocks the full potential of the human brain, giving them special powers called "Psionic powers." After much more development with the introduction of psionic powers into society people began to abuse the powers, resulting in the creating of psionic crime fighters. You take control of Cain (Ice T), a psionic detective who has just caught wind of a master plan being hatched by a mysterious hooded figure who calls himself Golgatham.
