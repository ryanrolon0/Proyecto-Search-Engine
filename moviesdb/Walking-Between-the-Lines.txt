Walking Between the Lines

 A writer struggles to communicate through the words on a page and through the distance between him and his wife. In an effort to bridge their separation, she discreetly helps him through his writer's block by sending him out for a walk, armed with an Apple iPod. Along the deserted streets of downtown Los Angeles, the chains on his story come undone and he awakens to the parallels between fiction and reality.
