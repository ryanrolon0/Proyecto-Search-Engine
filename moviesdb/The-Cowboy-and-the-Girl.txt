The Cowboy and the Girl

 The scene is a parlor out West, with Ray Mayer sitting at the piano in is cowboy duds - hat, scarf, and chaps. He plays a little barrel-house music and then introduces Edith Evans, who enters wearing fur. She sings - her voice a light-opera soprano - while Mayer plays. After singing one song, she leaves the stage to Mayer, who does another comic song, this one with lyrics. Evans returns, having changed costumes, and sings "Sing me a little baby song," with Mayer's sometimes comic accompaniment. The set ends.
