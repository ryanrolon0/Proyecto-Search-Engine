The Mermaid's Ballet

 A beautiful and mystifying picture. A ballet dancer is seen performing her graceful dance upon the surface of a lake. There is a slight ripple upon the water, producing beautiful effects, and the audience is left wondering how the dancer stays on the surface of the water and why she does not sink.
