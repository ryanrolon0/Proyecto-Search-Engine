South of the city of Durban, on the east coast of South Africa, is an area consisting of a handful of middle to low income suburbs which are not only linked through their geography but more importantly through their love for soccer. This area is affectionately known as 'South of the Umbilo' and is responsible for producing many talented South African soccer personalities. An area where ruffians and footballers mixed to form a lifelong bond, a bond born out of passion, determination and a unique and undying love for the game. This is the inspiration behind the documentary film Soccer - South of the Umbilo. Directed by John Barker, the film pays tribute to his father Clive Barker, the well known South African coach.
