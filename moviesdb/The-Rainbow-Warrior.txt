The Rainbow Warrior

 This film tells the true story of the sinking of the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior (commanded by Jon Voight), in Auckland Harbor in 1984, and the subsequent investigation by the New Zealand Police (led by Sam Neill) which revealed French government responsibility. The ship was on its way to protest French nuclear testing in the Pacific.
