The Universal Hanging Together of all Things

 Two concepts control the universe idea of getting what you give. What goes around comes around. Synchronicity, a term coined by philosopher Carl Jung, is the idea of a universal consciousness, a set of coincidences so large and so improbable that it seems only logical to assume there's something deeper working on the fabric of reality. Together, the two ideas form 'the Universal Hanging Together of All Things,' a story of two men, Roman Huedan, a religious terrorist, and L. Martin Carlyle, the splitting image of gluttony. And through these two men, a modern fairy tale is crafted, chock-full of 21st century mysticism, magic, and cosmic jokes. Oh, and there's a moral of the story too; for those who like that sort of thing.
