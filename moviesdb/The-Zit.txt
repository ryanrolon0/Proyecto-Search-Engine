 Timmy, a young boy preparing for the big school dance, is forced to deal with his first pimple problem--and what a problem it is! Every attempt he makes to rid himself of the ever-growing dilemma only succeeds in making the situation worse. Timmy hatches an ingenious plan to rectify his situation but can't anticipate the surprising consequences of his actions. And neither will the audience.
