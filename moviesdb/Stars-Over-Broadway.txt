Stars Over Broadway

 Al is a down on his luck promoter who is thinking of taking the final bow when he meets Jan, the singing porter. He sees something in Jan so he signs him to a contract. Al works odd jobs to pay for Jan's singing lessons and drops the idea of Opera when he learns that it will take years. He has him sing in a nightclub and from there it is up. But Jan soon starts missing lessons and rehearsals and hits the bottle so the partnership between Al and Jan ends. Soon Jan is also unemployed and Al pays the professor to take him to Italy to see if he will be able to sing Opera.
