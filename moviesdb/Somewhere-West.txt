Somewhere West

 Ian, a terminally ill young man, decides to forgo any further treatment and heads out onto the road in search of solitude and a beautiful place to spend his final moments. And yet, against his best efforts, Ian becomes the center of a makeshift family of troubled, but kind-hearted characters who help him in the redemptive process of letting go, opening his heart and finally reaching his undetermined destination. 'Somewhere West' is a tender journey of forgiveness and friendship that travels 3000 mile across some of the US' most revelatory landscapes including The Badlands, Black Hills, Devils Tower, Yellowstone, and Utah's Salt Flats.
