Shere Punjab

 Highway no. 8 is one of the main thoroughways that link Ahmedabad with the rest of India. Trucks ply day and night on the highway, carrying goods to and from places as far as Mumbai, Bangalore and Punjab. Along the highway are cheap hotels called dhabas where these truckers halt, get refreshed and move on. Just before the city border is one hotel called 'Shere Punjab'. Truckers, mostly Punjabis stop here, unload their goods in the nearby godowns, pick up a new load and set off again. This film is about these men of the road and their dhaba.
