In search for relief from onerous discontent, 21-year-old rucksack filmmaker Theodore Martland confronts the truth about reality in this part documentary, part narrative, cinema verite exposition that elucidates the fundamentals of Buddhist meditation. His motivation was clear-to find the cure to his dissatisfaction-but when Martland set out on his journey to India to live in a Buddhist monastery, camera in hand, he had no idea what he would discover as he struggled to understand his own mind. Using the camera as a tool to unravel the truth about the Self, Wandering Mind is an experiment with the mind and film, as we witness the step-by-step realizations of a novice Buddhist practitioner. Filled with insight, inspiration, and clarity, this film will allow you to discover the path of meditation and leave you questioning even your own existence. The film features vivid teachings from numerous meditation masters, including one of the best known and most respected Zen masters in the world today, poet, and peace and human rights activist, Thich Nhat Hanh.
