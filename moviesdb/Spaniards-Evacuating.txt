Spaniards Evacuating

 "In the background of this picture are the grim walls of Morro. Down the steep hill come the Spaniards, horsemen, soldiers and mules. As the processing zig-zags in and out on the narrow trail, it presents a very picturesque scene. The men look dogged and dejected. The mules carry all kinds of supplies; personal baggage, camp utensils, cannon wheels, and all the paraphernalia of an army."
