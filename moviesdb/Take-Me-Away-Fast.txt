 The adventures of Frank Gossner, a DJ from Berlin turned 'Indiana Jones' of record digging, as he journeys throughout West Africa to dig for rare, vinyl recordings of African funk and soul music from the 1970s. Frank's mission is to salvage these recordings before they are burned or lost forever and bring them to new audiences in New York City and Europe.
