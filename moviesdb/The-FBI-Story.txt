The FBI Story

 The story of the FBI unfolds through the eyes of one of its agents. During his career he investigates gangsters, swindlers, the klu klux klan, Nazi agents and cold war spies. While giving a lecture at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, veteran agent Chip Hardesty recounts his career with the bureau. He goes all the way from the days when the bureau was nothing more than a over-glorified legal clerks office to the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country. He also recounts the various cases he worked on from fighting the Ku Klux Klan to fighting communist subversives.
