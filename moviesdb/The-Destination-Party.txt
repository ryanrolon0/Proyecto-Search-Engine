The Destination Party

 With a cast comprised entirely of children, The Destination Party is the story of a party celebrating the return of a long lost brother. High heels and ankle socks, chandeliers, wheat bread and sing-alongs all coalesce to create a strange and magical world imagined by children and made real by the camera's eye.
