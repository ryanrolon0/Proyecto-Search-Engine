Silver & Gold

 We begin our story with Maria rising to start her day of idealized and utopist labor solitary, yet divinely connected to nature. During her impossibly lovely work routine, she comes across a shimmering presence. It is a cheap mannequin with a sequin costume, but Maria sees a magical friend, which exuberantly takes her over and releases her from her diaphanous gown and transforms her into the queen of all her realm. At first Maria is willing to share her realm with the figure, but then discards it, as she steps into her new role of power. But this role comes with a hitch, as Maria discovers to her horror that she has acquired a penis along with the new costume and role. She hears a strange buzzing and discovers she is being chased by a swarm of penises! After a furtive chase she is knocked out cold, when she stumbles and hits her head on a rock by the creek. Lying in a state of unconsciousness, her penis turns into a pink, sparkling and talking oracle. He reassures her that her greatest curse is also her greatest blessing.
