Seven Generations

 300 Kilometers west of Toronto lies the forgotten town of North Buxton. Established by abolitionists and runaway slaves, it was founded as a place where communities could live free. The population, however, has steadily declined over 7 generations, leaving few there to continue the dream. While away at University, Chris Prince felt this obligation to his family and tradition, returning home to farm the land of his ancestors.
