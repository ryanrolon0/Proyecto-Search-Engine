 Up-and-coming R&B singer Sterling travels from Mississippi to Los Angeles in search of her dreams. She soon ends up down and out, sleeping in her car, and taking the first job that comes her way. Her prayers are answered, however, when she meets Nate, a music producer who holds the key to fulfilling her ambitions but not everyone is who they seem.
