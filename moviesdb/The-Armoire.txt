The Armoire

 Adolescents Aaron and Tony are playing a game of hide and seek in Aaron's house, Tony now the hider and Aaron the seeker. When Aaron can't find Tony, he gives up. Tony has apparently gone missing, which brings the authorities and news media in on the case. Ultimately Aaron is placed under hypnosis to see if he remembers anything significant about that day leading up to the game of hide and seek. As Aaron remembers backward from that game, he reminisces about an earlier incident in the armoire in his bedroom.
