Through Borrowed Eyes

 Through borrowed eyes is a short documentary about the city of Amsterdam. Trying to find the enchantment she once felt regarding this city she decided to break away from her safe surroundings and take the subway to the rougher edges of the city. During her search she met others who, like her, had come to Amsterdam by a twist of fate. Through their eyes she rediscovered her own city. This has led to an assortment of city images and portraits with a strong photographic character, that she put together into one documentary.
