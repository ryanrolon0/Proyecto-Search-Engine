Tom Dick and Harry

 Ginger Rogers, a telephone operator, is pursued by George Murphy (a down-to earth fellow), Alan Marshal (a rich man) and Burgess Meredith (a noncomformist). She dreams what life would be life married to each of them. Working girl/telephone operator Janie is engaged to conservative, dull, but very reliable car salesman Tom, who offers her a safe, stable marriage. Then she meets unconventional slacker Harry, a philosophical car mechanic without much ambition although she does hear bells when they kiss. Through Harry, the fickle Janie meets Dick, a handsome and charming millionaire playboy, who embodies her greatest romantic fantasies, and after a champagne-filled overnight flight to Chicago, she thinks she's met her dream man, but has she?
