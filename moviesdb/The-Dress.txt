The script, inspired by a poem by Rumi, is based on an eclectic mix of more than 400 weddings that have occurred over the past fourteen years on the Lyndhurst Estate. The Dress is a farce on the modern day wedding. It is a character driven film filled with humor and heart. Driving home universal themes of family, identity and absolute truth. Featuring up and coming film star, Taylor Treadwell, The Dress includes an ensemble of thoughtful, emotional, and talented breakout actors. Screenwriter and Director, Jessica Hester, leads the amazing cast along side her acting muse, Tommee May. In addition to the film's content, The Dress will feature an original soundtrack filled with vibrant and soulful home grown talent that set the tone of the film.
