The Last Wild Mountain

 Through first hand accounts, we follow the story of a handful of characters as they formed their own world fueled by discovery, obsession, disappointment, and hope. In 1970 Warren Harding attempted the controversial ascent of the Wall of Early Morning Light. This moment represented a fundamental rift that would repeat itself in the generation to come. Harding prided himself on being a rogue element in the Yosemite climbing society. Batso was a master of publicity, often calling the press alerting them of his latest climbing venture. This was in complete opposition to Royal Robbins, the most respected climber in American history. Robbins' talent and boldness were comparable to none and was known for his stern and seemingly esoteric approach to climbing that defined climbing standards for all. These opposing styles and personalities came to a head when in 1970, Harding lead an ascent of The Wall of the Early Morning Light. After a 30 day climb that involved media circus, Royal Robbins would quietly but violently head up the route and chop off all of Harding's bolts. The characters from this decade would all but disappear in the 1970's. This story is about wanderlust in the modern age, and how it is played out in the world of rock climbing. It contrasts the electricity of adventure with the fragility of life, while encouraging thought on our existence in an evolving and disappearing natural world.
