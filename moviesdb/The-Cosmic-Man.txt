The Cosmic Man

 The latest UFO, a white globe levitating in a California canyon, is investigated by the Air Force, aided by physicist Karl Sorensen. Just big enough for one "man", the object seems impenetrable, but that night a half-invisible being visits the town, and a strange bundled-up man takes a room at Angela Green's mountain lodge, the investigators' headquarters. Sorensen thinks the Cosmic Man is benevolent, but to the colonel he represents either danger...or military advantage. When a large, ball-shaped object lands in California, not far from an air base, air-force Colonel Matthews and civilian-scientist Dr. Karl Sorenson are assigned to the investigation, and the two men clash as to the reasons and means of the investigation. The investigators make their headquarters at an lodge owned by Kathy Grant, whose son, Ken, is a cripple. Eventually, The Cosmic Man, who can appear and disappear at will, emerges from the ball-object, and Sorenseon sees that he is merely studying the earth and its people. In an appearance before the scientists and the military men, The Cosmic Man asks them to change their attitudes so they can co-exist with others in the universe. The Cosmic Man sees that not all present think his request is a good idea.
