Victoria and Vancouver

 A look at Victoria Island and its capital, followed by a visit to British Columbia's largest city. The history of the island is one of fur trapping, a dispute between Spain and England, and the Englishness of contemporary Victoria, from its large buildings and its bobbies to its homes and gardens. We watch Scots celebrate their heritage, and we watch Royal Canadian Mounted Police conduct parade exercises. It's on to Vancouver, city of 250,000 people, built on trade, especially lumber. In Stanley Park, a statue commemorates the visit of President Harding to Canada in 1923 and Canadian-U.S. friendship.
