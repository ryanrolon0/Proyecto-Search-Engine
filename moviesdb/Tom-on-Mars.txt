Tom on Mars

 Tom is the astronaut who in 2049 goes on the second mission to Mars. Just a few days before the start of his mission he meets the love of his life - Maria. Going further away from Earth during his complex and risky space travel Tom starts to experience serious psychological difficulties. Close confinement, isolation and inability to remain in touch with Maria make him shut down communications with the mission control. The enduring test does not finish even upon his return from a 70 million-miles journey. The seven-minute love-story of Tom and Maria is based on a number of real-life cases of dangerous psychological challenges experienced by astronauts during long space assignments or by researchers staying in remote areas such as Antarctica.
