The Irresistible Lover

 J. Harrison Gray, a wealthy playboy and notorious womanizer, finally decides to find the "right" girl and settle down. He finds the right girl, Betty, who is a policeman's daughter. However, in his pursuit of her he is hit by a car, knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital, where a steady stream of ex-girlfriends visits to "take care" of him--which doesn't leave a particularly good impression on the woman he really loves.
