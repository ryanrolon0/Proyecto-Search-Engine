Rhapsody in Black

 Ten black artists that changed the face of American music forever. Ten magical performances immortalized by CBC cameras. They lived in the United States in a time when racism was legal and sometimes lethal. They confronted segregation daily in clubs, hotels and restaurants. They encountered it in the recording industry where, if their records were labeled "Race Records", they could be marketed only to black consumers. And in television, they were relegated to secondary roles, and racial taboos limited their interaction with white hosts. Despite it all, they triumphed. They took their music where the work was - at home or abroad. They lived in the United States in a time when racism was legal and sometimes letal.

CBC Television captured these musical icons in Canada at a unique moment in history, and now they have been restored to their original lustre.
