Right or Wrong?

 A group of young boys break some windows at a warehouse. The security guard recognizes one of them as a neighborhood boy, Harry. Harry is hauled into the police station and told things will go easier on him if he tells who his accomplices were. Harry must decide which is better, shouldering the blame for the entire incident or ratting out his friends.
