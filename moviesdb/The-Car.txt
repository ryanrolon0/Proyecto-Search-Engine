The Car

 The irresistable force of the modern world races into the immovable object of sleepy village tradition when Charlie roars his supercharged Westfield down the country lanes in The Car, a gentle comedy from Ascalon Films. Frustrated by the apathy of the local police sergeant, Charlie takes the law into his own hands and turns detective after his prized possession is stolen. But Charlie isn't counting on the natives putting a few spanners in the works and the brakes on his plans.
