The Vanishing Point

 A man returns to his basement apartment having just been rejected by the object of his desire, an angelic diner waitress named Mary Ann, and he sits down at his computer to record what might be his final entry of an ongoing video blog. "The Vanishing Point" is a short film narrative chronicling the final hours of a man's obsession. It's a dark comedy exploring a man's longing for beauty past, his quest to find that beauty in the present and the horror that he faces when he is unable to recapture it.
