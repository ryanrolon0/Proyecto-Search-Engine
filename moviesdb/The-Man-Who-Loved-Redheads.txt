The Man Who Loved Redheads

 The honourable Mark St. Neots is playing with some 'chums' when he meets and is bowled over by Sylvia. As he grows older he retains his image of this beautiful young girl with the red hair. Through a chance meeting, he can pursue his career in the diplomatic corps as well as the young ladies he meets. A charming comedy with a sting in the tail. When just a young boy, Lord Binfield briefly met and fell in love with redheaded-teenager Sylvia. He never forgot her face despite having gotten married and raised a family as well as having assumed his title and a position with the foreign office. One day on the street he meets a young woman who so resembles Sylvia that he asks her to dinner, posing as a bachelor and borrowing the use of the apartment of his friend, Oscar, and also the use of Oscar's man-servant Williams. He likes the excitement and decides to lead a double life so he can dabble-and-dilly with the opposite sex at will. Over the years, all of his dabbling-and-dilling are with women who resemble Sylvia. At one of his parties, his son Dennis shows up but Binfield persuades him to keep his secret. He and Oscar grow old but still go for an occasional fling, the latest being to take two models to the opening night of a show in which Dennis appears. He is startled to find his wife, Caroline, present and in the know about his young girlfriends and also his other escapades through the years. He is overwhelmed by her loyalty and affection and resolves to stray no more. He doesn't even recognize childhood-love Sylvia standing nearby, for she, too, has grown old. A young lad briefly and innocently meets a red-headed girl and never forgets. Though he becomes happily married he finds such a face framed in red hair continues to fascinate him whenever he encounters it. He even goes so far as to set up a second, secret, life and home to pursue his ideal.
