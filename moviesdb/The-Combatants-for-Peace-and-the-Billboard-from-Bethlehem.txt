The Combatants for Peace and the Billboard from Bethlehem

 The owner of an American billboard company engages Israeli soldiers and Palestinian resistance fighters (the Combatants for Peace) to form the backbone of interviews, historical footage, and stories of personal transformation. Together, they create a giant peace mural in the West Bank of Palestine. Featuring powerful music, poignant interviews with Israeli and Palestinian fighters, a brief history of the conflict, children having fun, and a vision for peace in the Holy Land, the film climaxes when 100 Israeli and Palestinian children paint a giant billboard that visits a mosque, a synagogue, and a church, before being posted on a busy American highway.
