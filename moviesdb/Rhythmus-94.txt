Rhythmus 94

 The generating material for Rhythm 94 is a sequence of photographs taken by the cinematographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge. The sequence is transposed into a single movement across the screen. The basic pattern arising out of the abstract nature of the photo animation is available for repetition at various speeds and in various spatial relationships.
