Stone of Destiny

 The Stone of Destiny retells the fascinating and true story of four young Glaswegian students who, in 1951, outwitted the British authorities in their successful attempt to take back the Stone of Scone - a beloved symbol of Scottish pride, back to its country of origin. In 1950, Ian is a university student and ardent Scottish nationalist in Glasgow. He wants to take back the legendary Stone of Scone, a 300-plus-pound sandstone block upon which kings of Scotland sat for their coronation before it was taken to Westminster Abbey in 1296 as a spoil of war. He confides in his friend Billy, gets 50 quid from a local politician, and goes to London to reconnoiter. He hatches a plan with two conspirators (hide in the abbey after closing, let in the burly Gavin while Kay watches the car, and carry out the stone). They set it for Christmas Eve, add Alan, a shy spindly teen who has a reliable car, and leave for England. What awaits them
