The Raw Truth

 The Raw Truth is a revealing and exciting look into The Raw Food Movement in Southern California. The Raw Food Diet is a diet consisting only of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. And is based on the premise that foods cooked over 118 degrees lose all of their nutrients while foods prepared below that temperature keep them. The advent of food processors, blenders and dehydrators has made this all possible. Could this be the next evolution of eating for our world? The film explores the world of raw vegans in Los Angeles, who eat only raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, claiming that cooked foods are the culprit for America's health problems. Are they on to something or are they paranoid victims of LA's ever-changing health-obsessed culture?
