Sex Gang Children

 On the 13th of June 2002, Sex Gang Children performed a rare London show at Ocean in advance of the release of "Bastard Art", their first new studio album in ten years. Shot from the audience's point of view, "Live at Ocean" showcases the music, both old and new, that has made Sex Gang Children legends of gothic rock.
