Sinatra racontE par le FBI

 When Sinatra died in 1998, nobody knows that the FBI had a file of 1275 dossiers about Frank Sinatra, by far the largest on any show business personality. What interested the FBI most was Sinatra's relations with organized crime, his friendship with the Kennedys Camelot and specially his links with left wing. He was followed by FBI agents, his phone conversations were taped and the FBI boss J.Edgar Hoover bugged all Las Vegas to watch him, in order to prove his links with mobsters but also with communists.
