Red Mountain

 Towards the end of the American Civil War, a rebel captain flees to Colorado to join a band of Southern mercenaries. He drags an innocent gold prospecting couple into trouble when the husband is accused of a murder he committed. Confederate Captain Brett Sherwood is on his way to Colorado Territory to join Quantrell (apparently intentional altered spelling of the actual Quantrill). He discovers that Quantrell is a scoundrel, serving only his own ends.
