The Paranormalists

 Kylie Harrison has a problem; her husband Mark just won't stay dead. At the end of her rope she calls in some experts, Chance and Ben of Aubrey/Bennett Investigations to deal with her supernatural problems. From the outset, the bickering paranormalists talk a good game, but it quickly becomes clear they may be out of their depth. Things take a turn for the surreal when Mark, alive and well, returns home from work to find his wife and a pair of ghost hunters creeping around a dark house. Is the house really haunted? Is Mark really dead? Do Chance and Ben have any idea what they are doing? When Chance and Ben rang the bell of the house on Young drive they knew what to expect passed for normal in their line of work. Kylie Harrison is far from normal. Convinced she's plagued by evil spirits - including that of her husband Mark - Kylie is at the end of her rope. Things only get worse when Mark arrives from work to find his wife raving to a pair of strangers. Is Kylie crazy? Is Mark alive? More importantly, do Chance and Ben have any idea what they're doing?
