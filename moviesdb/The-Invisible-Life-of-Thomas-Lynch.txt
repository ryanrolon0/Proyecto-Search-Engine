The Invisible Life of Thomas Lynch

 The Invisible Life of Thomas Lynch' is a dark comedy about a lonely small time hit man. Shot documentary style, the film reveals a pathetically empty and misguided man and the callousness of the film makers who just want to get the shots, unmoved by torture and murder. The contradiction between personal life and job, and the apathy of the people making the documentary reflects satirically the dispassion of the media
