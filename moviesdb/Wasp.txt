Wasp

 Wasp is about how wasps buzzing around you in the summer can be really irritating, and how the best way to cope is not to panic. The idea came from noticing how the motions of wafting away a wasp can be similar to Tai Chi, and about how you might use this to achieve a serene Zen state where you are then able to deal with the wasp, rather than manically wafting at it and getting more het up.
