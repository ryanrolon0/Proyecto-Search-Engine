 The old count Kristian Örnklo has four children spread around the world whom he has never met. His doctor convinces him that he should gather his children at his countryside estate. The doctor's son, John, is sent out to bring them back. They all meet at the estate, Kerstin from Sweden, Dagmar from Denmark, Olav from Norway and Enricor from Spain. They all have a wonderful summer, and John and Kerstin fall in love with each other.
