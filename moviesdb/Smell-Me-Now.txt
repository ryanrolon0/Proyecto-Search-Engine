Smell Me Now

 An unsuspecting couple make a pit-stop at a perfume store and find themselves in a literal war-zone of verbal/physical abuse and racial attacks. Never did a couple's need to smell good become so costly. Never before have salespeople tried such a blatantly aggressive approach to close business. In this time of economic recession, can the consumer still find a bargain without it costing them their lives?!!!
