The Shipping News

 An inksetter in New York, Quoyle returns to his family's longtime home, a small fishing town in Newfoundland, with his young daughter, after a traumatizing experience with her mother, Petal, who sold her to an illegal adoption agency. Though Quoyle has had little success thus far in life, his shipping news column in the newspaper "The Gammy Bird" finds an audience, and his experiences in the town change his life. Then he meets the widow Wavey... It's a film about an insecure man who starts a life only to see it fall apart in front of him. As he attempts to rebuild his life he meets some interesting people and learns things about his past and his family's past that he would not have been able to even imagine if nobody had told him.
