The Trans-Atlantic Mystery

 A group of jewel thieves have stolen the famous Stanhope diamonds and are trying to smuggle them into the U.S. through New York. However, there seems to be no honor among thieves as they quickly lethally double-cross each other. Doctor Crabtree and Inspector Carr are called into investigate when the ocean liner docks.
