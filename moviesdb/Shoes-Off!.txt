Shoes Off!

 On an elevator, Stuart sees an attractive blond woman in black boots, but loses his nerve before speaking to her. His life is dull include watering his cactus and buying a toilet brush. That Friday night, he sees the woman from the elevator get into a cab. He gives chase and watches her enter a house where a party is going on. Deciding to live dangerously, he crashes the party. The somewhat-stuffy host and hostess have a "shoes off!" policy to protect their new carpet. Before Stuart (plagued by a hole in a sock) can reach the blond, disaster strikes. Will Stuart be booted from the party and shooed away before he can connect with the mystery woman?
