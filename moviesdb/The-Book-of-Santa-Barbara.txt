The Book of Santa Barbara

 In this stunning documentary short, photographer Macduff Everton talks about the inspiration behind his stunning imagery in the recently published 'Book of Santa Barbara.' Featuring more than 50 photographs from the book and a soundtrack from Santa Barbara jazz legend Charles Lloyd, the short is simultaneously gorgeous and poignant. It explores the idea that more than just being another pretty book about a pretty place, Everton's work is a statement about what it means to be home. As an internationally-known landscape and travel photographer, Everton has traveled the world. But, as he says in the film, with his new book, he decided to rediscover his own hometown. 'I gave myself an assignment to photograph the place I live,' he says. The results are an artistic statement about what it means to be home, even when that home is to man others a vacation destination.
