To Fly or Fall

 Early one morning, a young man walks up to the roof of his apartment building. Peering over the edge, he is contemplating jumping. Not initially noticing her, he is approached by a young woman who was already on the roof contemplating doing the same thing. Their interaction with each other and the feeling of openness on the roof makes them believe that they would not fall but rather fly. As they approach the edge of the roof, what will they do, and if they do indeed jump, will they fall or fly as they imagine they can?
