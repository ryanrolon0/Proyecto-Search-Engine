Stupid Criminals Caught Doing the Act

 Criminals' failed attempts at fighting the law, with a bulk of the tape consisting of car chases. All footage is culled from archives of news feeds or surveillance camera recordings - and apparently even lifted from other similarly-themed compilation tapes. Many of the crimes featured are not unusual or particularly "stupid", but occasional graphical effects and subtitles are used as an attempt to add humor to otherwise mundane clips.
