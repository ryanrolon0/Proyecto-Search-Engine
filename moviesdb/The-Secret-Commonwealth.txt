The Secret Commonwealth

 Scotland, 1691 of his dead wife and child, clutching a slim leather bound book. This is no bible but 'The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies', a scholarly work on the inhabitants of the fairy world researched and written by the good Reverend himself. Kirk believes the contents of the book will allow him to reach his dead wife and child through the portal of the Fairy Tree on Doon Hill in Aberfoyle. He has worked long and hard on this book, talking to outcasts and seers, risking his faith, reputation and sanity. But now the book is complete.
