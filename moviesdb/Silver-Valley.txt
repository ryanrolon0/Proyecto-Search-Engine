Silver Valley

 Rancher Tom Tracey is so infatuated with flying that he adds wings and a propeller to the ranch jalopy, which spooks and upsets his horse Tony more than a little bit. But when rustlers strike the range and kidnap Tom's sweetheart, Shelia Blane, Tom hires an aviator to fly him over the countryside in an effort to locate the rustler's roost. When they do, Tom uses a rope ladder to swoop down and rescue the girl, and then returns to rout the rustlers.
