Quark and the Vikings

 In the third of a series of cartoons featuring Quark, the ugly troll from _Valhalla (1986)_ (qv), a group of sea vikings are caught by surprise when Quark suddenly dumps into their ship, causing it to sink. They capture him, but not for long, and instead he takes them on a ride.
