Snow Follies

 In a highly FICTIONAL (no selves)winter lodge, singer Lillian Roth sings pleasantly and Bruce Holden also sings a song; The Morrell Sisters & Billy give a roller-skating demonstration, followed by the (very young) King Sisters (Alyce, Donna, Louise and Yvonne)doing a fast-rhythm song. Lola Jense does a specialty dance and Consolo & Melba do some ballroom dancing. Accoddionist Ann Triolo closes this Universal two-reeler.
