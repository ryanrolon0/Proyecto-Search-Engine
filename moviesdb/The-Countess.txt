The Countess

 This is yet another bogus title gleaned from the error-filled pages of The Braff Silent Short Film Working papers by Richard E. Braff. There is no reliable documentation that a film bearing this title with Joyce and Morey was ever produced by Vitagraph or any other company at this time. Most likely the correct title is The Question (1917) q.v.
