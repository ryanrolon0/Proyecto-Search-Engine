Raja Babu

 Raja Babu (Govinda) is a poor orphan adopted by a wealthy village couple (Kadar Khan and Aruna Irani). He is a typical country bumpkin, good-hearted but lacking in urban manners. He falls for Madhu (Karishma Kapoor) when he sees her photograph in a studio and chases her on his bike decorated with plastic flowers with his sidekick, played by Shakti Kapoor. Taken in by his smart appearance and impressive talks, she reciprocates his love but walks out on him with all villagers watching when she learns that he is no match to her urbane, well-educated self. It was particularly humilitating for his father as it happened in front of villagers who respected him highly. The movies takes several twists with a typical Bollywoodesque happy ending. Villains are nabbed by police but not before being beaten black and blue by the hero, boy gets his girl and parents are reunited with their son. Kishan Singh lives a comfortable existence in a small town with his son, Raja, and wife, Janki. He had finalized Raja's marriage, when he still a child, with a young woman named Madhubala. Now when Raja and Madhubala are both grown up, Kishan goes to them to arrange their marriage. He is insulted and humiliated by city-bred Madhubala, who refuses to marry an ignorant illiterate like Raja. Enraged at this, Raja vows to make her his wife at any costs, and sets out to do so. After several misunderstandings and misadventures, he convinces her that they are suitable for each other. He returns home to give this news to his father, only to find out that his father has arranged his marriage with a senile young woman, and he will never permit Madhubala to become his daughter-in-law. Now Raja has a choice - give up his parents and marry Madhubala - or stay with his parents and marry a senile woman he does not love.
