Remember Last Night?

 After a night of wild partying at a friend's house, a couple wake up to discover the party's host has been murdered in his bed. A detective is called in to investigate, but his investigation is hampered by the fact that the partiers drank so much the previous night, nobody remembers anything that happened.
