Taxi for Two

 The night and next morning in the lives of a taxi driver and a couple who's eloping. The groom doesn't want to wake his bride's father on the night of the elopement, but Ben the cabbie gets a few things wrong. Next morning, after the wedding, while the newlyweds nap in the back seat, Ben has traffic problems. When he can't get the hack started, the police insist he push the cab out of the way. Not wanting to wake the couple, he gets help from Billy, a fellow cabbie, and the push turns into an adventure that ends in court.
