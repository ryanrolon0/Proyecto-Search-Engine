The Danny McKay Project

 The story of a young man named Danny McKay who discovers, in the prime of his life, that he has a terminal brain tumor. His journey begins with the difficult task of telling his family and friends of his life threatening illness with predictable results. His sister Michelle and girlfriend Sonya are both devastated at the news, while his ever defiant mother Celeste simply refuses to believe that her 25 year old son could possibly be sick. Danny fights through the treatment process, with the help of his loved ones and at his lowest point, he pushes them all away. His happy-go-lucky best friend Jordan drags Danny off to Las Vegas in hopes of cheering him up. While there, an awkward conversation with a Las Vegas prostitute brings Danny back to reality. With the assistance of his doctor and pastor Danny continues on, but his condition worsens. Nearing the end of his life, Danny has a chance encounter with a young boy named Benny, also dying of a brain tumor, and his mother, Sharon. Through his interactions with Benny and Sharon, Danny is able to come to terms with his own mortality and in the end he discovers what life is all about.
