The Lempke Brothers

 Two box factory workers from a small Soviet country called Kreplach, The Lempke Brothers accidentally discover a unique ability to dance and to dream. Wanting more out of life, they escape the communist country and find themselves in America - Minnesota to be exact - where their dreams turn to reality and they soon study their new found craft. Eventually this town is not enough for the siblings, so they head West and land in Las Vegas and become headliners at a local club called Spritz-N-Sparkle. But will that be enough for the dynamic duo and can they ever escape their communist past?
