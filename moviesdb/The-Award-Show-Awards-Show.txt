The Award Show Awards Show

 A riveting 90 minute documentary, THE AWARD SHOW AWARDS SHOW uses vintage clips and interviews with awards show experts to explore the rise of awards shows. There are over 500 entertainment industry awards shows, 100 of which are televised, and this program explains why they matter and why they don't. Along the way, it takes a sardonic look at the way publicists manipulate red carpets, why nomination campaigns have become especially cutthroat, and why it was so hard for Susan Lucci to win a Daytime Emmy.
