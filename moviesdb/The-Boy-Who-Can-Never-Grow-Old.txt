The Boy Who Can Never Grow Old

 Imagine gradually losing the ability to use your muscles. You're born a healthy baby, but by the time you're a teenager you need 24-hour carers to do everything for you. Imagine knowing that the condition would eventually lead to your early death. What would you do? This intimate uplifting film follows 19-year-old Stuart Wickison who has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, as he prepares to leave the comforts of Treloar's, his special needs college, to study and live independently at university. Although Stuart is nearing death, the film follows him as he pushes himself beyond his limits, to achieve his dreams.
