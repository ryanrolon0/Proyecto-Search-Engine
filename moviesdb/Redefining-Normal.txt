Redefining Normal

 A coming-of-age tale about Tony Hensley, an innocently naive young man and nefarious outcast from the straight world who doesn't quite fit into the gay world either. Tony leaves his small-town trappings of Terre Haute, Indiana to find a new life under the bright lights of late 1980s Hollywood, California. He experiences the trials and tribulations of crossing into adulthood in a self-absorbed and shark-infested world of sex, drugs, and glam, alternating through the tinseltown's highest clouds of euphoria to the lowest pits of despair, and ultimately finds a balance on the road to self-acceptance.
