The Bewitched Traveller

 A man is getting dressed in preparation for going on a trip, but when he thinks he is done, some of his clothing suddenly seems to be missing. Then, when he is having breakfast, the table doesn't seem to be where he thought it was. When he tries to catch a coach to take him to the train station, he finds that his troubles are only beginning.
