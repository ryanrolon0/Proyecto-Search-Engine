The Silent Voice

 Franklyn Starr, a talented and wealthy young musician, suffers a double misfortune in the sudden loss of his hearing and in the death of his Mother to whom he is deeply attached. He loses his generous, joyous nature and transforms into a gloomy and despondent misanthrope. Sensitive about his deafness, he retires to an isolated home in the country, his sole companion being his faithful servant, and lives the life of a hermit. Wandering in the woods, he is unable to hear the workmen's warning cries and is injured in an explosion, Marjorie Blair, a young society woman, riding nearby, comes to his rescue and aid. Upon his recovery, he and Marjorie have fallen in love and are married. Just when their future looks the brightest, Bobby Delorme, a relative of Starr's, takes advantage of a past innocent flirtation with Marjorie, and creates a situation in which Starr believes that Marjorie has been unfaithful to him. He again becomes embittered.
