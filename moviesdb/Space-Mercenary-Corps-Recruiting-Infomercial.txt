Space Mercenary Corps Recruiting Infomercial

 The Space Mercenary Corps Infomercial is the first part of the sequel to the film 'Sci Fi Summer Girl's Off Day'. It is a captured recruiting video for one of the villain / antagonist groups in the Sci Fi Summer Girl universe of stories, in this case, the Space Mercenary Corps, who were also portrayed initially or introduced in the short film 'Sci Fi Summer Girl's Off Day'. Though it starts the sequel, it also works and was intended to work as a stand alone project / product. It does have some rough subject material, which would rate it PG.
