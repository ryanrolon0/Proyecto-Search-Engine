Under the Tonto Rim

 When the Tonto Rim gang attack Brad's stagecoach, they take the strongbox and kill one of his workers. Learning the gang member Patton is in jail, Brad gets himself thrown in also. Chito helps break him out and he takes Patton with him. Patton leads him to the Tonto Rim hideout, but needing to get to the Sheriff, Brad finds himself a prisoner. Brad Canfield plans revenge when the Tonto Rim band swoops down on one of his coaches, murders the driver and kidnaps a passenger, Lucy Dennison. Brad and his Irish-American partner Chito Rafferty learn that the Arizona Rangers have never found the gang's hiding place. Gang member Tony Patton is in the Tonto jail and, posing as an outlaw with Chito as a Ranger, Brad gets himself locked up and then stages a jailbreak, taking Patton with him. Patton leads Brad to the ranch of John Dennison, the gang leader, whose sister Lucy is being held prisoner. Patton introduces Brad as a new outlaw recruit. Brad tips Sheriff Curtis the location of the hideout, but the suspicious Juanita, who has been guarding Lucy, trails him and warns Dennison. Brad returns to the ranch and is taken prisoner, but he gets free, kills the guard and holds the gang trapped until the posse arrives.
