The Dissent

 An adaptation of the Book of Genesis. Here told with serpent replaced by a banker and father of two, troubled by dreams and fears of damnation. Like Dante, he travels into the depths of his nightmare, only to find a surprise that breaks his preconceptions of what hell is. He must take his new found knowledge back to his children, the 'Adam and Eve' of the tale. First Descending, then Dissenting, Gene learns a bit of reversal of the word. His daughter, Lillly, picks up the torch, and completes the cycle of Dissent, causing discord and separation to be permanent and known, where it had perhaps always lain under the surface of suburban sanctity.
