The Repair

 The Repair is a short film combining both live-action and animation about a young, obese man named Glen who is obsessed with super heroes and television. He lives a sheltered distraction of a life propped up by junk food and his custom recliner chair, complete with built-in microwave. However, technical problems arise just as the final episode ever of Glen's favorite superhero cartoon is airing. A battle of man and machine ensues, as Glen fights to preserve his lifestyle and know his hero's fate.
