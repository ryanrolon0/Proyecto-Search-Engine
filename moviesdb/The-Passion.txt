The Passion

 A woman becomes fixated on a certain purse in New York City's trendy Meatpacking district. Her fiancEe says they cannot afford it. She is a woman who knows what she wants and won't let her financial reality get in the way of her desire. She secretly buys it only to have her friend betray her, tell her fiancEe that she bought it behind his back. This leads her down a path that she wouldn't have expected. Could there possibly be more to life than a purse, or material objects?
