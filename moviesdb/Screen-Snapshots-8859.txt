Screen Snapshots 8859

 Ralph Staub spends about two minutes talking to Peter Lawford and Las Vegas hotel owner, Wilbur Clark, in the new footage, and then dusts off 1952's Screen Snapshots, "Meet Mr. Rhythm," and, a new screen snapshots is born, with only about a couple of minutes of new footage and the other eight minutes of watching Peter Lawford and Wilbur Clark listening to Ralph Staub tell them about the day when Frankie Laine, and wife Nan Grey, first opened their Antique store in Hollywood.
