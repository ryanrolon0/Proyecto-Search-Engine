The Road to Nasiriyah

 The Road to Nasiriyah is the extraordinary journey of two American filmmakers to document the unprecedented looting of archaeological sites following the 2003 Iraq war. The film is a poetic meditation on postwar Iraq and an intellectual thriller that ends in a dramatic kidnapping. The journey includes characters whose stories become intertwined - an Iraqi archaeologist who risks his life to protect sites, our interpreter who quotes Hegel and Shakespeare, and a man who plays both sides for profit; protector and looter. This is a story about the chaos of war and the loss of values. It's a cautionary tale about a dark time when the beginnings of recorded human history, buried in the sands of southern Iraq, were destroyed.
