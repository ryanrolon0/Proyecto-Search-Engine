Toughi

 There is an old saying in Farsi, "if you catch a Toughi to keep, it will bring bad omens to the members of the family". ...And that's what happens to a very close nit family when Toghi is caught for keeps. A well respected uncle plans to marry a young woman who lives in a far away town. He asks his young nephew to bring the fiancEe home to him. On the way back the young people fall in love, get married in secret, and return home with their secret. They're both afraid to tell the truth to the family. Eventually the uncle finds out, and to teach both his nephew and his fiancEe a lesson he starts a bloody revenge.
