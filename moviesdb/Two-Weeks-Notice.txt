Two Weeks Notice

 Explores the question of whether it's ever too late to say 'I love you'. The story revolves around Lucy Kelson, a brilliant but neurotic attorney, and her client, who is "charming, irresponsible and fabulously wealthy." Lucy Kelson is a Chief Counsel for the Wade Corporation, one of New York City's top commercial real estate developers. She's a brilliant lawyer with a sharp, strategic mind. She also has an ulcer and doesn't get much sleep. It's not the job that's getting to her. It's her millionaire boss, George Wade. Handsome, charming and undeniably self-absorbed, he treats her more like a nanny than a Harvard Law grad and can barely choose a tie without her help. Now, after one year of calling the shots-on everything from his clothes to his divorce settlements - Lucy Kelson is calling it quits.
