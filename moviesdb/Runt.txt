Runt

 When Christopher confronts his own violent temper which threatens the family life of his wife and children, he flies home to Jamaica and engages in an exorcism of the spirit, from his memories of his abusive, philandering, and hard-living father, Henry, whose name for his only son was "Runt". "Runt" is a strikingly passionate story of a Jamaican-American man, Christopher Davis, who confronts his ancestral demons in order to become the man he wants to be for his son. From Los Angeles, Christopher returns home to Jamaica when he feels his "snap" coming on. A "snap" is that moment the nice gentle Jamaican man everyone knew, all but disappears to reveal the headstrong, philandering, macho, prideful, violent, male spirit that lives within. During his "healing" and through his childhood flashbacks, we discover a character that is complex, conflicted, and passionately layered.
