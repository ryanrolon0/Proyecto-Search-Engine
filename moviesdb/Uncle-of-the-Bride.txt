Uncle of the Bride

 Preparations are underway for the wedding of Glenda, Wesley's daughter. Her uncle Seymour, a retired headmaster and enthusiastic inventor, is organising the stag party for the groom, Barry, and manages to lose him down a hole on the moors. With the assistance of Seymour's 'Self-propelled wheelbarrow' the groom gets to the church just on time.
