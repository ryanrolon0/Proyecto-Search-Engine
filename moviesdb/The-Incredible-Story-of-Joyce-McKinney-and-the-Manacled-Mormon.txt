The Incredible Story of Joyce McKinney and the Manacled Mormon

 Until Joyce got her pet dog cloned last year everyone seems to have forgotten all about her... But now... This may or may not be the true story of Joyce McKinney. But it's a hell of a story. And it is all true. But whose truth is true? Her story? Or History? Joyce McKinney was an ex-Beauty queen (Miss Wyoming 1974). Kirk Anderson was a Mormon missionary in the UK. Joyce and Kirk ended up in a deserted Devon cottage for three days. She said it was a love fest - he said he was forced to have sex with her. Joyce was charged with abduction and held in Holloway for three months pending trial. A suitably titillating tale to whip up the tabloid war in 1977, with a story you couldn't make up. But this isn't a film about sordid sex. It's about the British public's nouveaux-Victorian attitudes and how the tabloid press foster their approbation.
