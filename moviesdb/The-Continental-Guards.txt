The Continental Guards

 For many years the Mardi Grad held annually in New Orleans has formed articles for numerous magazines and newspapers. The celebration is unique -- unknown to any other state -- and has made the City of New Orleans famous throughout the world, as it is attended annually by thousands of spectators from all over the country and the demand for moving picture films which would fittingly portray this celebration has been universal. We obtained last year special permits from the Mayor of New Orleans which enabled our artist to reproduce the principal scenes for the benefit of our customers.
