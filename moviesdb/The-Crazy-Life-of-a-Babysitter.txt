The Crazy Life of a Babysitter

 A petite teenager explains the perils of babysitting to a documentary filmmakers focusing on American workers. During the interview she recounts the number of times she wound up bound and gagged on the job - either by her wayward charges or villainous home invaders. The brunette remembers one time when the children she was babysitting tied her to a chair, cleave-gagged her with a black piece of cloth and tied her feet to a piano bench. While the poor girl struggled impotently, the children tied matches to her toes and proceeded to give her a hotfoot. She also recounts times when she was grabbed while sunbathing, sitting by the pool and taking a shower by villains her left her to roped and silenced while they robbed the house.
