Traumrauber

 In this magical musical, adventure-seeking twins Finlay and Marty Ranger face their greatest challenge. During Science Week, reigning class mischief, Magnum Opius, reveals his most evil creation, his much-labored TRAUMRAUBER - a machine that steals people's dreams. Before the children of 11B can do anything, Magnum successfully nabs Marty's dreams. Now all hope rests on Finlay to make her way through the classroom obstacles and face the malevolent Magnum, or all will be lost forever. The first ever TRAUMRAUBER has arrived.
