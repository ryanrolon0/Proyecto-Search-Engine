 The Special Forces are nothing like James Bond, and are no slick young boys with inflated muscles. Their profession is killing. They use any means available to achieve the goal set before them... A gang of well-trained and highly disciplined guerrillas is on operation not far from Chechnya. Their commander is a legendary figure, who can allegedly not be killed by bullets or mines. The Special Forces team has the mission of eliminating the gang commander. The Special Forces sniper knows his enemy well; the two of them have their own accounts to settle...they are more than enemies.
