This Is My Witness

 This is my Witness follows the journey and personal transformation of two women who go to New York to tell their stories of brutality at the hands of the military regime in Burma. Inspired by the example and leadership of their beloved Aung San Suu Kyi, the women join a global movement to bring democracy to Burma.
