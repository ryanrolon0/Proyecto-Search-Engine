Raaz Ki Baat

 Kishore Rai comes from a wealthy family and lives with his older brother, Ashok, sister-in-law, and a young nephew. He meets with a beautiful young woman named Kamal and both fall in love with each other. When Ashok comes to know about Kamal, he is displeased as he does not want Kishore to marry a woman whose sister, Ranjana, runs a nightclub. When Kishore persists, Ashok slaps him, and asks him not to return home. Thereafter, Ashok is found wounded and hospitalized. The police come to know of the altercation between the two brothers and arrest Kishore, and hold him until Ashok regains his senses and can make a statement. The question remains, was Kishore the assailant, if yes, will Ashok implicate his brother in this assault?
