Rivers of Babylon

 Rivers of Babylon is a Jamaican Scarface/City of God style drama about of group of kids growing up in the slums of Kingston in the late 1970's. Recruited by the government to be bodyguards to the politicians who need the support of the sufferers in the slums, these same politicians, once elected, find them expendable, and branding them outlaws, turn the army and police against them, forcing them to flee to Crown Heights, Brooklyn in the mid 80's. Here in the U.S. they lay claim to their new American territory with outlaw bravura. Known for being "harder than the rest", it will take six major law enforcement agencies to bring these Jamaican posses down. It is also the story of one young man, a talented musician, who chooses life over death, his daughter over his posse and heads to Miami for a fresh start. With echoes of "Scarface" and "City of God," "Rivers of Babylon" is about a group of kids growing up in the slums of Kingston, Jamaica, in the late 1970s. Brought up on Spaghetti Westerns and American gangster flicks, they're recruited by the government to be bodyguards to the politicians, who needed the support of the "sufferers" in the slums. Once elected, these same politicians found these kids expendable, and, branding them outlaws, turned the police and army against them. Seeing their older heroes gunned down in cold blood, they flee to America in the late 1980s, settling in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Feared and honored for being "harder than the rest" they would lay claim to their new American territory with outlaw bravura, and the dance-hall music born of their world would define "gangsta" culture for a generation of angry sufferers in Jamaica, America and England.
