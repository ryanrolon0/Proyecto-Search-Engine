The Last Birthday Card

 Scott is a painter, a very bad painter whose stuff is worse than what's on the walls at your local coffee-house. To make ends meet he's got a side job - he's a professional killer. Now that he's good at. When Scott finds himself competing for a job with San Francisco's most notorious hitman, the inimitable Nak, he realizes he must decide between a dangerous but lucrative career and doing what he loves.
