Seeking Wellness Part One

 A conceptual video project that uses traditional narrative film technique combined with unique visual and aural experimentation to tell the heroic story of a group of burn survivors during their first painful steps towards recovery. This film was shot through the closed-circuit camera security system of an actual burn clinic and features performances from several staff members and patients from that clinic. 'Seeking Wellness Part 1 of Friendship, Shrine of Scars' is the first in a series of projects exploring ideas relating to victimization, recovery and empathy.
