The Crystal Arch Project

 This documentary chronicles, from inception to completion, the creation of a commissioned art work, showing how one community comes together to make a vision a reality. Interviews with the artists, community craftspeople, manufacturers, and city officials are blended with scenes of the design and creation of the Crystal Arch, a crystal-glass archway in downtown Anderson, Indiana.
