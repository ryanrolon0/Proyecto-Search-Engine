Three Days to Vegas

 Fitzy, a Florida retiree, dislikes his daughter Elizabeth's fiancE and has three days to get to Vegas to convince her not to marry. He enlists the help of his three aged golf buddies - Dominic, Marvin, and Joe. Elizabeth's ex, a slacker named Billy whom Fitzy really likes, organizes the trip on a chartered bus. After revelry in South Beach, they set off, stopping in New Orleans at the mansion of Marvin's rap-star nephew, the Flow. En route, they fire their gay drivers who start their own crime spree, so the police are mistakenly looking for Fitzy and his "gang." Dad, golf buddies, the Flow and his entourage, the engaged couple and her ex, and the cops are headed for the chapel.
