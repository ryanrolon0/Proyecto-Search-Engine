That Was Me

 The story follows Ted Reyes, a genius. He works for a think tank, fixing other people's problems. As Ted struggles to relate to the world around him, he begins to understand that the people in his life don't care about him and their significance in his own life have always been overstated. He struggles to hold on to his dying wife as he struggles to hold onto himself, his identity and his sanity. Ted's story is one that everyone on the planet can relate to; how do we define ourselves when the world around us crumbles apart?
