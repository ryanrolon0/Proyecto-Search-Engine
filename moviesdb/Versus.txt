Versus

 Two mobsters meet in a bar to trade some stuff. They are mobbed by four of the bar patrons, who kill one of them. After a pursuit, thieves escape on their motorbikes. Toni, the surviving mobster, calls Jan and his hit men to get back his stuff and to make the thieves disappear. This will take to a desperate situation, full of shootings, blood gallons and some acid drops.
