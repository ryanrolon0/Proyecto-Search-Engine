The B-Boys

 When you're taking a shit in a public bathroom, you don't talk to people in the other stalls. You just don't. It's part of the social code of bathroom etiquette that everyone follows. In The B-Boys, a stressed businessman sits down in a stall to take a quiet, peaceful crap but soon is joined by his biggest nightmare, an overly friendly stranger who won't shut the hell up.
