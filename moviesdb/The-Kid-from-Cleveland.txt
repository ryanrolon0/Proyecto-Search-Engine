The Kid from Cleveland

 Teen baseball fan Johnny Barrows sneaks into the baseball stadium of the Cleveland Indians, then playing in the 1948 World Series; claiming to be an orphan, he befriends team members & broadcaster Mike Jackson. But it develops that Johnny has a troubled home life with his mother and stepfather, and is involved in juvenile crime. His 'better side' shows only when he runs away to visit the team again. Can Mike and the Indians (playing themselves) wrest Johnny away from bad influences?
