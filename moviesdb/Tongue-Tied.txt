Tongue-Tied

 Brad and Matt are studying while Sam stretches. After Brad burns his tongue on a light bulb, chaos ensues. After a bold and affirmative declaration by Sam, she decides to practice her yoga... on the table... between Brad and Matt. With her curves between them, the boys can barely concentrate. Only after someone announces that Julia Roberts is on the premise does the awkward conversation disperse.
