 Mateus, his wife Antônia, their three kids and his brother Pedro open a grocery/bar in Goiânia, Brazil, in 1959, called "ArmazEm Brazil". But in the opening party, the Police, headed by a violent inspector nicknamed "Capitão", arrives to arrest, with extreme violence, an outlaw known as "Flexa". This violent scene scars the family permanently, and becomes the prelude to a tragedy.
