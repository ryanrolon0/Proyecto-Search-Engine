Should Heaven Fall

 Transported to the seedy world of Film Noir, we glimpse into this police drama behind the curtains of power; a world the public rarely views and where no one is to be trusted. Surrounded by other dirty cops, Nails threatens to kill Lips, accusing him of ratting out their plans during a night of interrogation. Beautiful femme fatal Rita plans to entrap her man Hank into his admission of guilt and murder.
