Rapids Above American Falls from American Side

 So much has been said of Niagara Falls and its surrounding beautiful scenery that it is unnecessary to enlarge on it. The above-mentioned films are taken from the best portions of the Falls and show them to an advantage. We justly claim these Niagara Falls pictures to be the best that were ever taken without exception. The panorama of the Gorge Route is beautiful beyond description.
