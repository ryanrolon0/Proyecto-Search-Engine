Tera Mera Pyar

 Raj Singh runs a travel agency, is married to Preet, and is the father of a young daughter, Pinky. After five years of marriage and the arrival of Dolly, Raj's friend, his wife starts suspecting him of having an affair with his Secretary, Nikki, while she herself decides to establish herself as a singer/dancer, neglects her home and Pinky, and goes on to have an affair with Jeet, the owner of Jeet Music Company. Neither is aware that both are mere pawns, manipulated by a devious conspirator who has a motive of separating them at any and all costs.
