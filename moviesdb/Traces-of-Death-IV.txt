Traces of Death IV

 The fourth entry in the "Traces of Death" series stays on the same track as the previous films by showing scenes of real life violent deaths and gory accidents caught on film. This volume shows scenes of birth defects, tumors, leprosy, different piercings of the male and female genitalia and even midget wrestling, and like the previous entries this ones definitely not for the squeamish.
