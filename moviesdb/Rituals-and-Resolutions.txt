Rituals and Resolutions

 It's Christmas time and Arno, a guy with a huge gambling debt, seeks help from Larry in a bar. Larry is willing to pay, but Arno must earn it. He has to do just one little thing. At the same time, few tables further on, Will is consulting Henry and George, two grumpy old men. He has hallucinations about his fiancee cheating on him. Behind the bar Mirabell is crying. Her boyfriend has jilted her, after she found out he was cheating on her. Nadine is helping her out with advice. None of these troubled people know each other, but their lives have more in common than one might think
