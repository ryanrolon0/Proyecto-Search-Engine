Steps

 A father and son's struggle with the demands of economic hardship and the pressures of recent times. In a world that so many Australians would find familiar, the father and his son endure a day fragmented by hope, loss and the familiarity of each other. In the fathers search for a better life he has failed to realize the very purpose of his mission, not only to provide a home but his role as a father. His son watches on, day to day, never questioning authority but hoping one day, he will grow up to be just like his dad. Ironically, in a cruel trend of life, his father had forgotten his son's mere existence and the importance of the smaller things. The boy living in his fathers shadow, must find a way to step up to his fathers level and just maybe save them both with a lesson of innocence.
