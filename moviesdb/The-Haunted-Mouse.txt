The Haunted Mouse

 A starving cat wandering in the wilderness sees a sign that says, "Ma's Place/Home Cooking/3 Miles." The cat speeds into town, without noticing the sign that says, "Ghost Town / Population 100 Ghosts." One of these ghosts is a mouse eager to get revenge on cats for having tormented him in life. The dopey cat makes for a perfect scapegoat, and the ghost mouse immediately sets out to harass the hungry kitty.
