 Dave, who suffers from Mastrophobia, and his two immature buddies borrow/steal Dave's dad's gay partner's 69 Corvette to take to a party. While at the party the Vette sustains some damage. The boys have 10 hours to get the car fixed and back to the house before the dad and boyfriend get home. As the pressure rises, the friendships are tested. The story ends with a surprise, where Dave unintentionally and surprisingly resolves the conflict with his Dad and Dad's boyfriend.
