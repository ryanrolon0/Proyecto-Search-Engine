Trotting Thoroughbreds

 The true story of the trotting-horse champion, the bay-filly 'Shirley Hanover', from foaling to the winning of the "Hambletonian," the richest race for trotting horses, and winning it against 10-1 odds. The horse was raised at the Hanover Shoes Farm - owned by the Hanover Shoe Company - in Hanover, Pa.
