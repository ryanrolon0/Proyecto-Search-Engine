The Man Who Loved His Car Way Too Much

 The protagonist (driver) is obsessed to the extent that his fridge is full of motor oil cans, he likes to brush the rims with a toothbrush and feed oil to his car with a spoon and so on. The driver is accompanied constantly by a little girl who he does not like. The driver likes to race his car and win against older cars, he likes to fuel, polish and tune his car very often. He does seem to forget to take care of himself though. The girl reminds him to eat, drink water, clean-up but he has no time for it.
