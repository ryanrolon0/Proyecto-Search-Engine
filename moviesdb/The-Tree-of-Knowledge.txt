The Tree of Knowledge

 The wicked Belle gets her hands on Nigel Stanyon, a young man who was about to embark on a career as a minister. She seduces him, empties his bank account and tosses him aside. In the depths of despair, Nigel is discovered by Brian, a wealthy old friend, who secures him a job as an overseer on his family estate. One day Brian embarks on a trip abroad, and Nigel is astounded when he returns home with a new wife--Nigel's old flame, Belle.
