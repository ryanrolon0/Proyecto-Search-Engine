View from a Grain of Sand

 Combining verite footage, interviews and rare archival material, VIEW FROM A GRAIN OF SAND is a harrowing, thought-provoking, yet intimate portrait of Afghan women's history over the last 30 years - from the rule of King Zahir Shah in the 1960's to the current Hamid Karzai government. Told through the eyes of three Afghan women - a doctor, a teacher and women's rights activist -this documentary tells the story of how war, international interference and the rise of political Islam has stripped Afghan women of rights and freedom. Together with rarely seen archival footage, their powerful stories provide illuminating context for Afghanistan's current situation and the ongoing battle women face to gain even basic human rights.
