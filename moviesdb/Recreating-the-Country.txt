Recreating the Country

 Recreating The Country documents the story of the first 'Biorich' sustainable planting taking place in regional Victoria, Australia. This short film features an overview of the concepts and actions being undertaken between The Ballarat Region Treegrowers and Imerys Minerals Australia, who own the site on which the planting is taking place. This is an important project for the viability of sustainable forestry in Australia, which has one the worst rates of species and habitat loss in the world.
