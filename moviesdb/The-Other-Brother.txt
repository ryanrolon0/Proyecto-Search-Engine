The Other Brother

 Matthew shares a strong bond with his younger brother Andrew. He is devoted to protecting him. In an attempt to save face in front of two neighbourhood girls, Matthew makes a regrettable decision to send Andrew home from the local park alone. This short walk is long enough for a kidnapper to change the lives of everyone involved in the most unforeseeable way.
