The Consolation of Children

 In the wake of his death, the two survivors of English ventriloquist, Arthur Worsley (1920-2001), incorporate his dummy into their daily lives. Lovable, terrifying, covered in goat skin, "Charlie Brown" begins to take on deeper meaning for Arthur's elderly widow and his adult son as both grow older in the declining resort town of Blackpool.
