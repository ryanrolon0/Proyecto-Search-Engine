 Seven people with problems and two therapists. Spending time in a lonely hut in the mountains. A whole week therapy which could be strenuous but healing. One person has an eating disorder. The other is neurotic, another has a drug addiction problem and someone has panic attacks. In the one case a person always carries a photo album of his family with him. Group dynamics and no hectic can be an explosive mixture for the two therapists. Strange things happen. All seven use cameras to document there progress. They show mysterious clues from an uninhabited house. Someone leaves deadly messages, somebody that they know in their weakest and most afraid state of mind. From the nine people there are only eight...seven...six...
