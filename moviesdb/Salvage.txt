Salvage

 A group of raiders ransack abandoned homes for food and clothing in a post-war city, coming into contact with relics left behind. Due to a terrible accident, they are forced to spend the night and are confronted with the question of what can be brought from the old, preserved world and into the cold, dark world to be made anew.
