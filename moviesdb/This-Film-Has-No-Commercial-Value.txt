This Film Has No Commercial Value

 The twinkling light of distant stars, by the time it meets our recording devices, has been traveling for millions of light years. This means that the starlight of the distant future has already emanated from its distant source and is on a predetermined journey. Human civilization, in contrast, is much less predictable, capable of actualization but also prone to creating chaos and hell on earth. The film will mediate between order and chaos in the universe and compare / contrast this with man's propensity for manufactured chaos. An idea I'm interested in is the contrasting natural forces of time and space and man's futile attempts to control his own fate. This philosophical outlook, man's vainglory, his over-reaching tendencies leading to catastrophe, has been an underlying theme in my films.
