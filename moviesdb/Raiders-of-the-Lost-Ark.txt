Raiders of the Lost Ark

 This is a shot-for-shot remake of the original _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv), made by three teen-age boys in Mississippi over the course of seven years. Their production wrapped in 1989, and was shelved and forgotten until 2003 when a copy fell into the hands of 'Eli Roth' (qv) (writer/director of _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) who passed on a copy to 'Steven Spielberg' . Spielberg congratulated the boys on their hard work, and said he looks forward to seeing their names on the big screen. 'Scott Rudin' (qv) and Paramount have purchased the trio's life rights and will be producing a film based on their adventures making their remake, known as _Untitled Daniel Clowes Project (2006)_ (qv).
