Salt and Silicone

 A dark comedy that exposes one man's mixed feelings on breast implants. Vex (Warren Pereira) is conflicted about his girlfriend Keira's (Katie O' Grady) desire to get breast implants. To resolve this conflict they consult with their sexy friend Jamie (Rachel Myers) who has breast implants, and Jerome (Ethan Atkinson), a frisky furniture store owner, who reveals his own cosmetic enhancements. The film deconstructs Vex's mental conflict into three disparate episodes each purposefully infused with unique direction, color grading, camera work, score, sound design, and acting performances.
