Vincent, le magnifique

 Once upon a time, in a lonely valley forgotten by all, lived Vincent the magician. Every Evening, in a local cabaret, he presents his show "The Woman Cut In Half". As he ignores the necessity of a trick, he transforms the neighborhood in a graveyard. One night, his idol, the famous Blackstone, appears to Vincent to reveal him the trick. On the way to glory and fame?
