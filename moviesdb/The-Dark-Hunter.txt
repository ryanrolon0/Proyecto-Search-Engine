The Dark Hunter

 'The Dark Hunter' is a Mocumentary comedy inspired by films such as 'Spinal Tap' and British TV comedy series 'The Office'. Fictional characters Duncan and Mark are wannabe filmmakers who think that they could do a far better job than the makers of 'The Blaire Witch Project'. This spoof documentary follows them through a series of disastrous witness interviews to the tragic end of their production in the woodlands of Shropshire in northern England. Temperamental student film makers Mark Jackson & Duncan Cowan are setting out to make a documentary about a large deadly black panther which has been stalking a small village in Shropshire, deep in the English countryside. The two directors with their cast and crew in tow are being shadowed by BBC Cameraman Johnnie Oddball who is making a fly on the wall documentary of the two self-destructive auteurs. Director Duncan Cowna is a man on a mission to make the greates horror/documentary hybrid of all time - and his friend and co-director...is just plain weird. A London News cameraman follows inept London filmmakers, Duncan and Mark, to a small village in the Shropshire countryside that been plagued by 'Big-Cat' sightings and attacks. Using the gripping accounts of local witnesses and visiting the woodland location of the most recent sighting, they intend to make the greatest Documentary-Horror movie of all time.
