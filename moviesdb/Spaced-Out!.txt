Spaced Out!

 Jonathan Winters plays the host to several stand-up Comedians who are all on his imaginary Space Ship. At some point Winters even visits the Star Trek Bridge which is part of a Wax Museum, and makes fun of the Star Trek crew. Then he gradually transports each comedian to his own space ship, where a small comedy club audience is waiting to laugh and interact with the various comics. This Showtime Video features some interesting comedy routines and the strange comedy stylings of Jonathan Winters!
