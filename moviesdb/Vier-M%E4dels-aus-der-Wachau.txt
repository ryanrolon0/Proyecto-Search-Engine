Vier Mädels aus der Wachau

 A remote Austrian village depends economically on its wine production. But no-one has heard of the place, and the wine business is in the doldrums. Then two sets of twins are born in the village simultaneously, and due to a misunderstanding, word gets around that they are actually quadruplets. As one of the mothers can't look after her twins, the rumour is allowed to become fact. The quads make the village famous, and as they grow up they are a singing attraction to visitors. Romance complicates the issue the convenient myth last?
