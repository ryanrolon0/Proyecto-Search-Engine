Superhelde

 Superhelde Albert and Peet - two wannabe Superheroes - have been struggling since their early school days to fit in. The only place where they feel at home is at the comic store, Dimensie Komieks. Unfortunately, Dimensie Komieks is deep in debt. As if that's not bad enough, the store is being threatened by Albert and Peet's school enemy, the Lex Luthor clone, JJ van Tonder. Saskia, Peet's flaming hot high school sweetheart, Monique, a shy shop assistant, SuperWayne, a regular customer at Dimensie, Albert and Peet put their heads together to come up with a way to save Dimensie from the bulldozers. The question remains however - Is there enough time to save Dimensie before JJ and his father blow it up completely. Superhelde - Reveal the hero within!
