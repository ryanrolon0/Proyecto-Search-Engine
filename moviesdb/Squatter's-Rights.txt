Squatter's Rights

 Squatter's Rights is a lighthearted comedy that exposes a real estate con artist that takes advantage of the wrong people. As a result the police that have been hot on his trail for months finally captures him and gives him his just deserts. It is a sidesplitting comedy with one good hearty laugh after another.
