Puzzle

 Steve Reagan presents a prologue on symbolism, then Barbara introduces Marc, who has a task neither easy nor difficult. He walks the streets of Chicago with a bouncing ball animation on Willie Nelson's "Stay all Night", (stay a little longer). He then finds a metal ball under a box of McDonald's. Meanwhile, a man in a tuxedo top and tails and bell-bottom jeans starts a tape of Mozart's 40th symphony, and pretends to conduct it from a bridge over highway 240. Then Marc is covered in silver cloth and Christmas lights.
