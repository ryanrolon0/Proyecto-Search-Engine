The Eden Project

 THE EDEN PROJECT is a continuum of public site-specific performances touching on the ART OF BEING, embodied peace, body awareness, and women's health issues. These works are inspired by yogic practice, tantric philosophy, feminist theory, and visions for social change. They playfully provoke public participation and quietly comment on the pace of our society and consumer culture. THE EDEN PROJECT is always a collective effort of women artists. 'Yoga Street Theater' is one documented work in this series, presented as an experimental short art film, shot on location in Manhattan envisioned, produced and co-directed by San Francisco based artist, Bast.
