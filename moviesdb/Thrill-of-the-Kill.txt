Thrill of the Kill

 Brilliant New York crime author Graydon Jennings accepts to help Kelly Holden investigate her sister Allison's murder, which seems uncannily equal to one his anti-hero-lead character Carlton James's kills for the thrill. In the sisters' Vermont home, starting from her diary, they come up with a theory Senator Darren Hartford sent the murderer to keep his adultery covered up. The sting of the tale is in the tail, for several parties. Haunted by the untimely death of her sister, Kelly Holden enlists the help of a murder mystery novelist, Graydon Jennings to solve the crime. He arrives in town and they soon put the pieces together of the secret life her sister was living. Entrenched in a sordid affair with a senator and her scorned ex-lover she left behind, Kelly and Graydon embark on a mission to unveil the mystery - but she soon finds herself in serious danger and she learns that truth is sometimes as evil as fiction.
