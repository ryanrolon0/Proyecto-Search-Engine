Suave Bastard

 Nathan Flyn is one Suave Bastard...at least that's what he thinks! A night on the town turns into a disaster, though Nathan takes the first steps on a course that will change his entire outlook on life. The rite of passage that can only be granted to him by a woman is not without complication, as she's a bored housewife with a very angry husband.
