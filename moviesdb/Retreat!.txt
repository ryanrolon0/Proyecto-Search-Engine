Retreat!

 Inspired by American war films from the 50's, Retreat! tells the story of a small outfit of U.S. Soldiers who were forced to retreat into unknown territories deep in the heart of Korea during the roughest stretch of the Korean War. Unsure of their position and having no way to inform headquarters of the situation, they decided to hold post at an abandon POW compound they stumbled upon during their untimely exit from the battlefield. With very little ammo to defend themselves, and fear of surrounding enemy forces, they have been patiently waiting for the search and rescue squadron which should be arriving any day now...
