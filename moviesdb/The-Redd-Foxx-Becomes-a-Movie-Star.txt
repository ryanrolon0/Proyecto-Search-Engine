The Redd Foxx Becomes a Movie Star

 'Redd Foxx' (qv) has been in various aspects of show business for several years, but is now starring for the first time in a feature length movie, the comedy _Norman... Is That You? (1976)_ (qv), co-starring 'Pearl Bailey' (qv), 'Michael Warren (I)' (qv), 'Dennis Dugan (I)' (qv) and 'Tamara Dobson' (qv). The movie is produced and directed by 'George Schlatter' (qv). The movie tells the story of a man, played by Foxx, whose wife has run off with his brother and who as a result goes to visit his only son, Norman, played by Warren, in Los Angeles for some sympathy, but receives something else entirely. The making of this family-centric storied movie is very much as a family, as Foxx, Bailey and Schlatter have been friends for years and treat each other as family.
