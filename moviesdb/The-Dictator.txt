The Dictator

 The story opens in Copenhagen in the year 1776 on the wedding night of the King and Princess Caroline Mathilde. But the marriage was a political alliance, and the Princess felt only repugnance for her dissolute husband. On the night of their marriage the King leaves Copenhagen on a pleasure trip abroad, but his fast life proves too much for his weak constitution. Summoned to attend him, an ambitious young doctor realises that here is a great opportunity. He revives the King and, tremendously impressed, the King takes him back to Copenhagen. A love affair develops between the doctor and the Princess - but it is to have terrible consequences.
