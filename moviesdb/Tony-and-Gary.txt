Tony and Gary

 Tony and Gary is a short film about two people living in Statesboro, Georgia and the trans-formative power of their 15 year relationship. Gary is a 45-year old man with paranoid schizophrenia who has been collecting Halloween decorations since he was a little boy. Having lost all his family members, Gary's ongoing relationship with his guardian Tony has allowed him to get out of the mental institution he was living in before, work and live in his own home surrounded by his beloved collection. Tony has a family of his own and feels proud of his ability to offer someone like Gary a better and more enriched life.
