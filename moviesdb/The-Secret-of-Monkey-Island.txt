The Secret of Monkey Island

 Guybrush Threepwood is a pirate wannabe who has just ended up on an island in the Carribean, called MêlEe Island. Here, he learns from three old grogg-swinging pirates that there are three things to master to be a pirate loot. So, Guybrush's first quests are the master these things. For instance, when you fence somebody, your swordplay isn't the most important thing, but what really counts is your wits. If you insult your opponent and he doesn't come up with a snappy answer, you get the overhand. On the other hand, if he does come up with a snappy answer, he gets the overhand. Guybrush learns how to fence and find treasure and when he's trying to steal a small statue at the governor's mansion, he runs into the governor, who turns out to be a beautiful young woman by the name of Elaine and Guybrush falls in love with her. Much at his dismay, the instant he's mastered all three tasks, Elaine is kidnapped by the ghost pirate LeChuck, who from now on will be Guybrush's arch nemesis. He learns that she's been taken to the mysterious Monkey Island and from a Voodoo priestess he learns that in order to get there, he needs a map, a ship and a crew. Guybrush Threepwood is a young pirate wannabe. He sets out on Melee Island to find his fortune. But in a bizarre twist of a beatiful governor, an evil pirate, and a whole bunch of monkeys, he is lead to the most amazing (and downright hilarious) adventure of his life!
