Things We Said Today

 Clementine lives with Ippolita, an artist, and is behind on her rent, quitting job after job (or getting fired), and generally living a life without responsibilities. She meets Jo, a young woman whose limited social life centers on caring for her aged father. Without telling Jo about Ippolita, Clementine spends a lot of time with her, and Jo falls in love. Meanwhile, Ippolita and the landlord are both getting impatient with Clem he for his rent, she for affection, responsiveness, and some sign that Clementine is an adult. Will anything shake Clementine into honesty and responsibility?
