Urban Genesis

 After serving 20 years in prison, Clifford comes home to live with his daughter Keisha, in hopes of making up for lost time. But the road to redemption will be harder than he thinks when he realizes that he has to deal with Keisha's live-in boyfriend, Boris, who is a mirror image of Clifford as a young man.
