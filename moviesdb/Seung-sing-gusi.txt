Seung sing gusi

 Alan and Eric are childhood friends who are separated when Eric moves to America. They are reunited in Hong Kong when Eric finds Alan at the cafe where the latter is working as a waiter and singer. Together they forge a business which is destroyed in a storm. Meanwhile, both have met a lady named Olive, and both strive for her affection. In the end, Alan's rising singing career and Olive's tendency to favour Alan over Eric alienates all three of them. They are only reunited once again in San Francisco, where Alan discovers Eric is on his death-bed from illness, and they realise what real friendship is all about, and how Olive would only be happy if she and Alan got married.
