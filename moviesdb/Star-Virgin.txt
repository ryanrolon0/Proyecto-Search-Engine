Star Virgin

 From a far, far, far away galaxy comes a beautiful Space Virgin who is apparently the last of her species. Born in a test-tube in the outreaches of the universe, this star struck cutie's sexual desires are a complete mystery to her. In desperation, our lonely space vixen turns to her trusty robot to explain the facts of life. Through a series of vignettes, the robot shows Star Virgin all about carnal life on the planet earth.
