Ride on Vaquero

 The Cisco Kid is captured while keeping a rendezvous with cantina dancer Dolores but is released by his captor, the commander of a U.S. Army regiment, to help break up a kidnap ring. On his way to Las Tables with his pal, Gordito, he makes a stop at the Martinez Rancho, where they learn that his friend Carlos has been kidnapped, from his wife Marquerita. At the Crystal Palace Saloon, Cisco runs into an old girlfriend, Sally, who he once jilted for a tight-rope walker, but she doesn't betray him when the sheriff and an army officer enter searching for Cisco. While Cisco and the easily-forgiving Sally dance, the heads of the kidnap gang, the sheriff, Clark and Redge, meet upstairs to discuss the plans for collecting the $50,000 ransom they have on Carlos. Cisco follows the kidnappers after they collect the ransom money, but before he can do anything about it, he is arrested and thrown in jail.
