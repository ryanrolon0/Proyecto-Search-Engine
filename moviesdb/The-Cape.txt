The Cape

 Maryam, an American-Muslim college activist, is a strong and confident leader who plans to educate the world about women's liberation. During an eloquent speech about women's strength, Maryam loses focus and becomes flustered as her eyes catch a glimpse of a Cute Guy. With constant encouragement from her best friend, Ava, Maryam attempts to overcome her fluster and approaches the mystery guy. However, encounters with footballs, archery nerds, and her own clumsiness foil her plans before she can make her impression. The once articulate and focused female activist becomes putty in the presence of a guy. Will Maryam muster up the courage to overcome her Kryptonite and let her cape fly?
