Spies and Guys

 Joe Besser is sent on a spying mission with a beautiful female officer. Things, as usual when Joe is involved, don't go well and they are captured and about to be executed. The girl drops her cape to reveal she is scantily clad (the high point), the enemy is confused and she and Joe escape.
