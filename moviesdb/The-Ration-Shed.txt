The Ration Shed

 An evocative collection of personal stories of the time when the Indigenous people of Cherbourg were under the control of the Superintendent and forced to live on meagre rations. This is the story of a community's journey to preserve these memories, pay tribute to their elders, and to let their young people know about the past, in order to understand the present and to dream a new dream for the future.
