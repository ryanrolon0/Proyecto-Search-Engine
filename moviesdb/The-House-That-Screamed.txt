The House That Screamed

 Marty Beck is a horror novelist who rents an old house believed to be haunted in an effort to inherit enough inspiration to finish his latest novel. What Marty's about to find out is the ghouls and ghosts that inhabit the house have a special plan for him, and dying may be the only way out of his lease.
