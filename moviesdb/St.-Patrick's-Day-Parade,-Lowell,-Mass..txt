St. Patrick's Day Parade, Lowell, Mass.

 Lowell, Massachusetts parade on a muddy street. With formidable buildings in the background, lots of male dignitaries pass on horseback, wearing silk top hats and sashes, some carrying bouquets of flowers. Interspersed is the occasional marching band - a bugle corps, a fife and drum band, and a brass band. There's a carriage or two, and several platoons of soldiers, marching in lines, their rifles over their shoulders. After the parade ends, we cut to a solitary older man in black leaving a church and walking past our vantage. He tips his hat.
