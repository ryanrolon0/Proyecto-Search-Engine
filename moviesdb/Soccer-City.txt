Soccer City

 Witness the cultural importance of soccer in township South Africa through the lives of five individuals born and raised in the oldest and toughest of South Africa's townships, Alexandra, locally known as 'Alex.' Seventeen-year-old dribbling sensation Nancy 'Maradona' Majola, former national team player Isaac 'Shakes' Kungoane, current professional Patrick Phunwayo, 69-year-old Jacob 'Babes' Bopape one of the first professional soccer players in South Africa, and scholarship-winner Ricardo 'Rico' Kutumela will all take you into a culture dominated by soccer and into a storied township still largely unknown and misunderstood even among South Africans.
