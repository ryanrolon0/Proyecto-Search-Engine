Spook Louder

 The stooges are salesman selling a weight reducing machine. They have no luck until they show up at the house of an eccentric inventor where they are hired as caretakers. When the scientist goes to Washington to demonstrate his death-ray machine to the government, the boys are left to guard his house and must contend with enemy spies and a mysterious pie thrower.
