The Anatomy of Bug Catching

 Four badass/brutally efficient friends Kurt, Val, Sam, and Leslie are the only survivors after a sexually transmitted virus ravages Seattle in a 48-hour period. What was labeled swine flu turns into a zombie pandemic. Their only hope is to make it to a Hockey rink in the suburbs before nightfall. On the way, they discover, like Walt Whitman, that sometimes, existing as you are is enough. The Anatomy of Bug Catching is about the quiet between zombie storms the quintessential sweet and lowdown-undead story.
