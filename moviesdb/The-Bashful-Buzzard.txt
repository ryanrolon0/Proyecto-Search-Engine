The Bashful Buzzard

 Once again, as in 'Bugs Bunny Gets The Boid (1942)' (qv), Beaky Buzzard is sent out by his Italian-voiced Mamma to bring home something to eat. While his brothers fetch a milk cow (with farmer attached), a string of circus elephants (including a baby one brandishing a banner reading "I am NOT Dumbo") and a dog attached to a fire hydrant, Beaky manages to capture a baby bumble bee.
