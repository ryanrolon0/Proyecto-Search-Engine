Retaliation

 As the peoples of Iraq suffer in the middle of a violent struggle for power, war correspondent James Bradford searches for the truth behind the truth. After being attacked from within a convoy, James finds himself to be a captive of a small but diverse group of terrorists. Awaiting beheading, he is befriended Rasha, the educated wife of one of the captors, who herself struggles to find a way to free her own son from the perpetual cycles of violence. Through this predicament, James learns of the true reason behind the Coalition forces infiltration into Iraq and why the terrorists are there to oppose them. The only question is, can he survive long enough to reveal the story?
