Spooks A-Poppin'

 A documentary about the phenomenon of "spook shows," which were a sort of circus-type freak show/carnival act that were often performed in movie theaters before a horror movie was shown. Film clips from several old spook shows and interviews with some of the performers and producers are shown.
