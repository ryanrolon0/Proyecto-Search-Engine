Shikashika

 Filmed in the Peruvian Andes, this rhythmic portrait documentary reveals the process of making a colorful shave ice called Shikashika. To make it one family must journey afoot to the vast glacial apron of a mountain where they cut enormous blocks of ice with an axe and bare hands. On the return journey they strap the ice blocks atop mules to bring down through steep granite canyons. The following day Shikashika is sold at the steps of a cathedral in the valley far below.
