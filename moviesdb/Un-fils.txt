Un fils

 Selim, a young man adrift, is a transvestite and a prostitute who desperately longs for his father's love. Omar, his father, lives a secluded life of grief and has never recovered from the loss of his wife. Like two lonely ships, they pass silently without ever really connecting. Only destiny will bring father and son together... a little too late.
