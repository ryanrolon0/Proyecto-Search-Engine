Stanley's Dragon

 Exploring a cavern, Stanley lost his companions and found an old egg revealed by a landslide. He is overcome with joy back home when a dragon hatches from it. The authorities don't see it the same way and send the dragon to a zoo. But Stanley is convinced the dragon will die if it stays there.
