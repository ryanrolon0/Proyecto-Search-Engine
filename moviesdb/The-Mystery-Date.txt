The Mystery Date

 'The Mystery Date' is a story about a young girl's relationship with her mother; how that relationship influences her life. It is also an inspirational story of a family, which has strong spiritual roots in the church. The mother is the central root in this family and she has been the guiding force for the family's spiritual commitment. As she encounters difficulties, the family somehow loses their way and a tragic event reminds them of how important it is to have God in their life. We see Kristal looking out of the window with Francis laying in the hospital bed behind her with Jim at her side. Kristal's mind goes back to happier times we she and her mother were having a fun afternoon watching television together. Francis is telling her about how Jim the mystery date that turned into to the love of her life. Why did this story mean so much to Kristal at this moment? Her mind stays focused on the mystery date being the perfect mate for her mother. It's ironic that ten years later she wants to find her own mystery date.
