The Man Who Saved Geometry

 The Man Who Saved Geometry is a portrait of the great geometer Donald Coxeter, whose work inspired Buckminster Fuller, helped Escher to draw, and reveals the underlying forms of familiar things, from pineapples to the modem. It is a mind-expanding trip into the fourth dimension and into hyperbolic space, and shows the shapes that make up our world, from newly invented molecules to the geometry of the universe itself. The film follows Coxeter, at the age of ninety-five, on his last trip out into the world, as he travels to a math conference in Hungary, then branches out from that voyage to explore the worlds his ideas reveal. It is at the same time a feast for the eyes, and an intimate personal portrait of one of the great minds of our age.
