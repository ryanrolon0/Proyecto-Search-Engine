Season Greetings

 As children watch with eyes wide open, hidden dreams and secret wishes break through the superficial cheeriness grinning from every street corner on Christmas Eve. Christmas, just more closing time, in a shopping center parking garage. Three couples bump into each other. They have only one wish stuck in a parking garage, but that is when the problems in their relationships just get into gear.
