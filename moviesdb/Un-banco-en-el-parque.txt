Un banco en el parque

 Juan and Teresa have been lovers for two years. The day before she leaves to live in London, he abandons the apartment they were sharing. Juan embarks on a series of encounters with other women. He only allows himself to meet them by chance. Every afternoon at the same time, he sits on the same bench in a park, and then he also sits at the same table in the same bar. Shortly thereafter, using these methods, he meets both Alicia and Ana.
