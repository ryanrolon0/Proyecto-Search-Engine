Social Contract

 This is an episode of torture between a wife, Liberty, and her husband, Consequence. The whole story is a metaphor for the way the U.S. (Liberty) uses its foreign policy to achieve imperialistic goals in the domination of third world countries (Consequence). The dialogue describes actual U.S. political history from the Truman era leading up to the tragic September 11 World Trade Center collapse in NYC
