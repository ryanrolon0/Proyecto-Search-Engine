The Open Gate

 Hetty is engaged to George, but after her sister dies she breaks the engagement in order to raise her sister's orphaned daughter. After many years, Hetty's niece has grown up and has fallen in love with George's nephew, but they have split up after a quarrel. George, still heartbroken at losing Hetty, helps his nephew make up with Hetty's niece, and in doing so, reconciles with his own long-lost sweetheart.
