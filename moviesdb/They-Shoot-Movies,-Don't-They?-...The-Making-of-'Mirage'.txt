They Shoot Movies, Don't They? ...The Making of 'Mirage'

 They Shoot Movies, Don't They? is a voyeuristic look at first time director Tom Paulson and the movie he wrote called Mirage. Frank Gallagher is the documentarian whose camera waits and watches as Paulson navigates through a jungle of investors, colleagues, friends and family, searching for money to finish his film. They Shoot Movies, Don't They? offers a line-blurring examination of what one might give up, in order to succeed.
