The Clubman and the Tramp

 A tramp tricks a cook into leaving her wealthy employer's house. While the clubman's house is empty the tramp makes himself at home, starting by helping himself to a good meal, then going upstairs for a bath and a new set of clothes. Attired in the clubman's clothes, the tramp walks around town, where he is continually mistakes for the clubman.
