The Final Winter

 As the winds of change sweep across the rugby league landscape, Grub Henderson (Matt Nable) defiantly stands among all others as the embodiment of those before him. Foreign codes of business are tearing at the fabric of loyalty that exists between Grub's club and family. He collides head-on with an administration eager to bury him, and battles against his brother and coach's betrayal. At home his wife is troubled by the transformation of the man she married, and his children are left wanting for their father. In a bid to cling to his self-worth, Grub bitterly swallows his pride and bargains for his future. As the game that provides him an identity crumbles, he finds acceptance in the man he could be. The cast features Matt Nable, Matthew Johns, Nathaniel Dean ('Candy', 'Walking on Water'), John Jarratt ('Wolf Creek'), Raelee Hill, Michelle Langstone, Conrad Coleby and Kate Mulvany.
