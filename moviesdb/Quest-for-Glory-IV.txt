Quest for Glory IV

 Whisked away from his friends in Tarna by dark magicks, the hero awakes to find himself in the dreary land of Mordavia (whose culture, creatures and landscape are based on slavic and eastern-European folklore from our world). Facing both the suspicious and superstitious people of the local town and the ferocious monstrosities roving in the quiet woods around it, the hero must win the trust of the townspeople by helping them in their various plights and problems and by making the valley a safer place for them to live in. Moreover, he must unravel the mystery of the foreboding dark castle of the valley's former ruler, which has now been standing abandoned for years... or so it seems. For a terrible danger threatens, as a Dark Master prepares an unholy ritual to summon a demon from another dimension and cast the land into eternal darkness.
