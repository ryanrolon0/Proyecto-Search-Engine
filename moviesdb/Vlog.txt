Vlog

 Copywriter Rachels job relationship and sanity are put on the line when an unflattering video is posted on her roommates insipid blog. Vlog is a satirical look at being a twenty something in the highly branded consumerist Internet generation. While shot as a short film meant for local screenings and festivals it also has the ironic potential to be a highly branded consumerist web or TV series for the twenty something consumerist Internet generation!
