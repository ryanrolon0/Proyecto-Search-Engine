Sherni

 Village belle Durga lives a fairly peaceful existence, until her gypsy father gets in the bad books of Thakur Dharampal Singh, and is severely beaten. He joins a band of robbers and takes revenge against the Thakur, who in turn, kills his family. Durga helplessly watches her family die, and the police refusing to get involved against the powerful and influential Thakur, leaving her with only one choice - join forces with her father, and become a thug and robber herself - and make her one of Indian police's most wanted criminals.
