Un día de suerte

 Buenos Aires in the year 2002; the economical depression has caught the country. Elsa keeps her head above water through several badly paid jobs and occasional criminal offenses with her friends Walter, Laura and Toni. She's saving money for a ticket to Rome to get out of her life and visit an Italian with whom she had a one night stand several months ago.
