The Evidence Was Against Him

 The scene is laid in front of a Baxter street clothing store. The proprietor has just succeeded in dragging a man into his place to sell him some clothing, when a tramp strolls along. The man comes out of the store highly indignant, and seizing a suit which hangs on a peg outside the store throws it at the tramp. The various articles immediately, in the most surprising manner, take their proper places on the tramp's body. The Jew rushes out and seeing the tramp wearing the clothing, calls a policeman, who arrests the tramp and marches him off.
