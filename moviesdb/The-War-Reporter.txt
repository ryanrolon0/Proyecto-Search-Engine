The War Reporter

 On June 23, 2006, a brutal act of violence ended freelance war reporter Martin Adler's life. He was 48 years old and a brilliant journalist and freelance filmmaker. Shot in the back in broad daylight, by what appears to have been an Islamic radical bent on disturbing Somalia's painful return to peace, Adler paid a heavy price for his nearly 20 years of reporting conflicts around the world. Brave, honest, truthful, dedicated are words that come to mind from people who knew him. With two children and a wife at home, Adler continued his work in the most dangerous countries out of strong belief his work might mean something. Based on Adler's raw tapes and rushes, the filmmakers create an inspiring film about a compelling world.
