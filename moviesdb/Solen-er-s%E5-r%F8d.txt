Solen er så rød

 Apparently, a 7-year-old boy is on a holiday with his mother. But it turns out to be anything but a holiday! When the boy is left alone, a family tragedy begins to unfold, and he is brutally torn out of the comfort and safety that his mother has built around him. A touching and moving film.
