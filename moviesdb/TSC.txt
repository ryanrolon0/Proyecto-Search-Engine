 In the near future a special operations team is deployed on a one way mission to destroy the clone threat. Architects of Fear represents a short film set in the larger Sentinel Chronicles Universe between Seasons 2 and Seasons 3. The Northern Alliance (a female dominate hegemony) and the ISA (A post apocalyptic neo feudal corporate state) join forces to defend the remnants of humanity against the rising clone threat. The clones originally were used in war between the human factions, but the next generation of entirely artificial clones ('Bioroids') turned against their creators and proved a threat to humanity itself. Now, a team has been sent to one of their research facilities in an attempt to gain access to the cutting edge research that the clones have been producing. Unknown to the team, the entire mission is a ruse. They have a Leviticus model clone with them, whose death automatically uploads its experiences into a new body. The humans are merely a distraction. Yet despite being set up, they manage to survive anyway, much to the consternation of their superior officers.
