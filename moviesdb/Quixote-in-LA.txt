Quixote in LA

 When LA's delusional Quixote decides to steal the Spanish Conquistador armor from the Southwest Museum he enlists the help of David (Quixote's de facto Sancho Panza) to carry out the audacious plan... set in contemporary, urban, Mexican/American Los Angeles, hilarious madness and mayhem ensues as Quixote struggles with his plight and slowly transforms himself into Don Quixote. Comedy/Satire. Some Language.
