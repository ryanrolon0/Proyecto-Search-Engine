Sometimes... And Always in a Dream

 Selling is selling, as Jim Ellison, an aging carpet salesman, knows very well. Moving laboriously through an endless night, from one unlikely client to the next he desperately seeks to do just that. Sometimes...and Always in a Dream is a truly American story dealing with the conflicts of personal success against the tapestry of the American Dream.
