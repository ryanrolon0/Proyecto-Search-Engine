Trópico de Capricórnio

 Four transvestites are brought in to a hotel room on the same night. One by one, they take on the director's game the empty room with a camera. They recreate themselves to this camera and through that character they start to slowly reveal themselves fantasies, hopes, questionings and their experiences in the streets of Sao Paulo.
