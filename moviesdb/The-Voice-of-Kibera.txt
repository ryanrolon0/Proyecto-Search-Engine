The Voice of Kibera

 On August 4th, 2010, the people of Kenya voted for a new constitution. In the weeks leading up to the vote there was a lot of opposition towards the proposed constitution. Tensions were high throughout Kenya. In Kibera, Africa's biggest slum, the proposed constitution had a significant impact. This documentary deals with the issues the people of Kibera faced in the weeks leading up to the vote. Corruption, bribery, tribalism and poverty impact every political decision made in the slum. While following the build-up to Kenya's referendum this film will also break down how politics works in Africa's biggest ghetto. This film is intended to give a voice to the residents of Kibera, a community of people who stand for what they feel is right.
