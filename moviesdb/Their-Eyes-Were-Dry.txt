Their Eyes Were Dry

 "Their Eyes Were Dry" is a compelling and powerful documentary that brings light to the Ma'alot Massacre, a historic event that took place on May 15th, 1974. Three Palestinian terrorists, disguised as Israeli soldiers, infiltrated the Lebanese border and stormed into an Israeli elementary school in Ma'alot where teachers and students were spending the night. All the teachers escaped and abandoned the children, who were then left helpless and forced to face the terrorists on their own. The terrorist's main objective was to use these young hostages in order to demand the release of imprisoned terrorists held by the State of Israel. "Their Eyes Were Dry" documents the birth of terrorism against children but more importantly celebrates the lives of these heroic children.
