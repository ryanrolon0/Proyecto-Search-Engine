Sodium Death Kiss

 Four men of various attitudes, ages and occupations meet one final time in an attempt to kill off the last zombie on earth. There's just one problem. You don't get to be the last zombie by being a smelly, stumbling, mumbling maggot magnet - you get there by being a different kind of zombie. A rather hot, attractive and articulate one. Having planned for such an event, the four assassins are prepared, but not quite adept enough to carry out their mission as planned. That's a problem. Haitian legend states that the only way to truly kill off a zombie is get salt in their mouth. Armed with that information, four would-be assassins set out to kill of the last zombie on earth. Unfortunately for them, she's hotter and smarter than any zombie they've ever encountered, so accomplishing their goal could prove to be a deadly quest...for them.
