The Writer's Pub

 An English playwright spent his entire life trying to write a hit play to make himself immortal. Instead, he died on the stool of his local pub after drawing on his last five pound note, an unmistakable marking. Years later, when the bill reappears in the hands of a patron, the locals realize the curse of the bill and the playwright have returned. How far will they go to rid themselves of the curse of the Writer's Pub?
