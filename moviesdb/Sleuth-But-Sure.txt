Sleuth But Sure

 Moe the Hare (aka The Rapid-and-sometimes Rabid Rabbit)breaks out of jail so he can hustle down the road and marry his sweetheart. But, Tommy the Tortoise, an officer of the law who is a stickler that thinks jail-prisoners should remain in jail, turtles down the road after Moe. And he dogs after Moe, in his own fashion, until he returns Moe to jail...and winds up with Moe's girlfriend in the process.
