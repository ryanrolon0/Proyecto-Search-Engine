Soul of the Slums

 A young man, framed and sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit, is released after serving his stretch and vows to find those responsible for framing him. Meanwhile he sets up a mission in the slums he came from, and falls in love with a girl he meets there. Jerry Harris, after spending seven years in prison for a crime he did not commit, returns to the east-side slums of New York City, vowing revenge on the gangster who framed him. He is aided by missionary Brother Jacob, his sweetheart, Molly, and "Dummy", a deaf-mute who knows how to crack a safe when needed.
