The Millionaires' Playground

 We visit Palm Beach, Florida, the Monte Carlo of America, where people of wealth enjoy the winter season. Among the notables glimpsed are 'Chauncey Depew' (qv) in his wheelchair, Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt strolling along the beach, Mayor Demick of Palm Beach, Mayor Anderson of West Palm Beach, Hugh Inman, Mrs. Percy Williams, and Mrs. Payne Whitney.
