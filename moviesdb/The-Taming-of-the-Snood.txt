The Taming of the Snood

 The police are hunting for a jewel thief. Two detectives follow a suspect who ducks into Keaton's Snappy Hats, where all hats are four-thirds off. The thief, a good-looking gal, has the clerk model several hats before she picks one; she slips a huge diamond ring into the band and asks the clerk to deliver the hat to her house. At her flat he finds an irrepressible maid, Odette; complications arise when Odette bangs her head and the clerk revives her with too much whiskey. The thief, the clerk, the maid, and a parrot are soon in various forms of duress, distress, and undress.
