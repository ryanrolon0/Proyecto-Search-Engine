Så nära

 With the passionate kind of crush that only 14-year-olds can muster, Angela and Arina dream themselves out of their Stockholm suburb to Berlin. Their goal Tokio Hotel, at Madame Tussaud's. But just as the girls have their goal in sight; their world seems to collapse around them. A film about friendship, infatuation and the heartbreak of growing up.
