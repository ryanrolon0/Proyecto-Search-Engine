Sommersonntag

 Sommersonntag (Summer Sunday) is the dramatic story of Bruno Hansen, a bridge guard of a huge lift bridge in Hamburg. As his 7-year old deaf-mute son climbs down into the restricted area of the lifting equipment while a train is approaching, he has to decide whether to sacrifice his son or to let the fully occupied train drown in the river.
