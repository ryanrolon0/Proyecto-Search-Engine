Timber Stampede

 The cattlemen graze their cattle in the big pines, but the railroad wants to clear cut the land and sell the timber for profit. Then they can sell the land to another railroad and make a lot of money while destroying the wilderness. Scott and Henry are against them and try to show that Jay and Dunlap are robber barons. First they must stop the phoney homesteading scam and convince Anne, that her glowing tributes to the railroad are unfounded by their greed.
