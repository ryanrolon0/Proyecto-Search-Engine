To Shoot a Rurf

 "To Shoot a Rurf" is a surreal 3D computer animated short produced by Dwarfed Films, Ireland. This atmospheric dark-comedy tells the tale of a drunken man's attempts to sober up after bingeing on mind-altering drink 'rurf'. To achieve this he must literally go inside his own head and seek the source of his headaches! The film is written and directed by Shane Sheils and Paula Sheils and created entirely using Blender 3D Open Source 3D animation/modelling software.
