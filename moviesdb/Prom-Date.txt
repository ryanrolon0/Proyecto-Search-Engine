Prom Date

 "Prom Date" is musical comedy about asking people to prom in an overly romantic high school. Evan Jacobs wants nothing more than to ask his dream-girl, Deanna to Prom, but will he be brave enough to go through with his plan? This is a story about high school, unrequited love, friendship, dreams, and above all, getting what you want, no matter what.
