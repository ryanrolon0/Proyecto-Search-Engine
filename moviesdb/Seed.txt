Seed

 After a decade of famine and food riots, the Mendelian Corporation feeds and controls the world through its genetically modified seeds. Twelve-year old Juan is a member of the Sprouts -the Mendelian corporate youth program in which young boys are trained to be the eyes and ears of local authorities. When Juan inadvertently discovers that his father Mateo may be involved in a local seed-running ring, he is forced to decide just how far his commitment goes to the Sprouts motto 'Duty First'.
