Soul Searching; The Journey of Thomas Merton

 This documentary is a meditation walk along the interior landscape of a great American mind, It follows Thomas Merton's path as Trappist monk, poet, essayist, spiritual writer, peace activist, environmentalist and hermit. In bringing to life his 27 years as a monk, this deeply considered film reveals the struggles of Merton's spiritual search and how he emerged from this crucible with an international reputation in 20th century letters- part Augustine, part Emerson, part Gandhi- whose thoughts still resonate some 40 years after his death.
