Sour Lake Oil Fields

 The following scenes were taken by our special photographer at different places on the Southern Pacific Railway System in Texas. To the officials we are greatly indebted, who afforded us every opportunity to obtain these splendid series of Moving Pictures. This Panorama of a part of the newest and most productive Oil Fields in the United States, situated at Sour Lake, Texas. There are nearly 1000 oil derricks and wells in this field. The Sour Lake Field is just twenty miles from the famous "Spindle Top" of Beaumont. This film gives an excellent view of Wells.
