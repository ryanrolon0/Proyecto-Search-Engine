Strange Triangle

 Viperish Francine Huber seduces visiting salesman Sam Crane. Sam later finds out that Francine is married to a business associate of his and decides to have no more to do with her. Francine is relentless and soon gets Sam involved in trying to cover up her husband's embezzling activities and ultimately implicates him in a murder. Sam Crane, a returning serviceman form WWII, is having problems adjusting to his old job as a bank-examiner and investigator, and gets caught in a web of scheming deceit by Francine Huber, who he met in a cocktail lounge escapade. The money-hungry Francine has forced her bank-manager husband into embezzlement and keeps him safe from exposure by Crane through a mixture of seductive infatuation and blackmail.
