Upstaged.

 In 2004, a Pennsylvania high school produced "My Favorite Year" for their annual spring musical. Spanning the five-month long process from the first audition through the final curtain call, Upstaged. chronicles the anxiety, commitment, frustration, and joy of the students and teachers working to bring this theatrical production to life.
