Skrållan, Ruskprick och Knorrhane

 The children of Saltkråkan Island take a public ferry to visit a relative only to find that she has went to hospital. When they try to row back home they lose the oars and must take refuge on a desolate island. 4-year-old Skrållan is the first to discover that two colorful smugglers are hiding on the island.
