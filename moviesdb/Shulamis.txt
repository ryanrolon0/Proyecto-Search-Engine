Shulamis

 While wandering thirsty through the desert, beautiful young Shulamis is rescued by handsome Avsholem, who swears to marry her upon his return from Jerusalem. When Avsholem fails to come for her, Shulamis pretends to go mad in order to keep her vow to him, yearning both for his return and for revenge. Her choice is at the center of this timeless Yiddish operetta of love and deception, of the price of revenge and the power of forgiveness.
