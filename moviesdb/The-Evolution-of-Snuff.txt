The Evolution of Snuff

 Pornographer Robert Furch makes a movie inspired by "Lysistrata," he says. A documentary crew films the casting call, Furch's 14-day shoot, a lighting technician's becoming an actor, and the aftermath of the suicide (before filming ends) of Claudia Fielers, the film's leading lady. Comments by Roman Polanski, Carl Amery, and an unseen narrator connect the possibility of snuff films to the process of a commercial enterprise such as this and Fielers' suicide. Furch pleads innocent, cloaking his work in Protestant virtues. His posturings and his direction are comical; the commentary may be tongue in cheek. What about the appended snuff footage? Is this documentary for real?
