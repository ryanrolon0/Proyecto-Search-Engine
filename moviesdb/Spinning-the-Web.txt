Spinning the Web

 In June 2008 the Writers Guild Foundation presented, for the first time, an all-day craft seminar focused on writing for the Internet. It gathered together writers, distributors, producers, an agent, a lawyer, a WGA analyst and some prominent journalists in the field, and asked them to share their expertise, experience and some insights they have gained from working in this fledgling medium. The result is Spinning the Web, which we hope you find as instructive and informative as did our attendees.
