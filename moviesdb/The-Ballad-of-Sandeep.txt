The Ballad of Sandeep

 When his IT job is outsourced to Bangalore, Indian-born Sandeep Majumdar finds himself unemployed for the first time in eighteen years. In an attempt to get his old job back, he sets up a remote access in his apartment, tricking his former company into believing that he is really working from India. His performance is so impressive that the boss of the company-the same man who fired him two months prior-requests an interview with Sandeep to discuss a big promotion.
