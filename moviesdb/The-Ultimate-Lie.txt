The Ultimate Lie

 Claire (Kristin Davis) is the daughter of Malcolm McGrath, dean of a prestigious law school who is heavily favored for being given a chancellor position over a number of law academies. Claire is bored and restless as a daughter of luxury and wealth. Unknown to her parents, she begins working as a prostitute for a call girl service catering to wealthy clientele. One of the premier VIP clients who uses this call girl service is a mysterious man named Harold Beck. Several girls working for the service have slept with Beck and were as pleased with him as he was with them. But one fateful night, Claire is selected to spend a night with Beck at his hotel room, and finds that Harold Beck and her father, Malcolm McGrath, are in fact one and the same man... a revelation that will change the lives of the whole McGrath family forever.
