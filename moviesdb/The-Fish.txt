The Fish

 Squeaker, a young sea snail ventures too far and is swept into "The Pit of Darkness" by a marauding shark. Sqeaker befriends Fairchild when the plot takes a sarcastic turn away from a Disney-esque children's film and takes on a South Park-ian dialogue poking fun at Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Katzenberg.
