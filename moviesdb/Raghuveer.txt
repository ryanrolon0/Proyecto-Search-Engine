Ravi's younger brother, Raghuveer, a college student, is also honest and dedicated and will not tolerate any injustice being done to anyone. In so doing, Raghuveer, himself is arrested and imprisoned on false charges. Ravi is enraged at Raghuveer at his embarassment, and will have nothing to do with him anymore.
