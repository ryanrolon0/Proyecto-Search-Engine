Under Lock and Key

 Like every good women-in-prison film, most of the cast here are women. This one is particularly good as they seem to get naked at the slightest provocation says, "Please get undressed." Thank you. Unfortunately, several of them break out of prison and things get boring for a while as they battle against the evil drug-dealer Carlos. Then we find out that he also "is a fashion designer on the side" and they bust in on his fashion show, complete with runway models, and run amuck. An FBI agent goes undercover in a women's prison to find evidence hidden by a drug dealer's ex-girlfriend. After she is taken off the case, she finds that the drug dealer has kidnapped her daughter. She enlists the help of one of her prison guards, and together they take on the drug dealer's mob.
