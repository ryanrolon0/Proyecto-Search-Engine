The American Scream

 A family wins a free vacation to a mountain resort, where the town is strange and its residents downright odd. The kids soon find themselves in deep trouble, and have to do a bit of literal growing up in order to survive. Everybody's average family; two unmanageable teens, a stress riddled, bumbling father, and his ever present whining wife-- meet the Benzigers. They think they're taking a trouble free trip to a mountain resort.. think again! This winter wonderland is a perfect setting for the evil rituals and unorthodox traditions that take place. This is no holiday! It's a holy hell and no one has a prayer. A bloody transformation of roles turns tortured teens into adults themselves. Some kids would kill to be adults. These kids may have to.
