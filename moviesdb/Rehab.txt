Rehab

 Camp Recovery, located in the coastal town of Santa Cruz, Cal., features a mix of new and long-term addicts, most of whom stay for 30 days (the maximum allowed by most insurance companies). REHAB chronicles their experiences in the center and follows them out into the less-supervised, far more dangerous, "real" world, riding the emotional tidal waves that accompany incremental progress and devastating relapses. The film offers a rare insider's look at the ups and downs of each addict's journey to stay clean.
