Surface Dive

 "Surface Dive" is a visually striking abstract film inspired by a diving trip in a freshwater lake in the Yucatan. Made from three layers of artwork (each animated separately and shot on a multi-level animation stand) more than 600 sculptures, 200 glass pieces and 2200 drawings combine to fashion a work of dazzling detail and complexity." -Bill Foster, Northwest Film Center Surface Dive was inspired by an experience Priestley had while diving in an underground river in the Yucatan, Mexico. The film combines three layers of abstract animation solid sculptures. The sculptures were made in silicone molds, shaped into replacement animation sequences and painted with acrylics.
