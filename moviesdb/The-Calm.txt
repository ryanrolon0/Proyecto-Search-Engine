The Calm

 Love can heal a broken heart, a broken spirit, or a broken dream. But sometimes love is hard to find. "The Calm" is the quirky tale of a group of misfit tenants living in a flee-bitten boarding house. As manager, Hank tries to keep up with his duties but spends most of his time obsessing over a mouse he can never catch. Una is a beautiful young lady who lives her life on her terms, even when that means annoying everyone with her musical experimentations. Hashback prefers a reclusive lifestyle, he spends his days alone in his room, laboring over uninspired paintings. Cookie is a woman who has spent so much of her time hiding behind her religious beliefs, she has forgotten how to live with others. And then there's Mainard, a traveling bait salesman, seemingly trapped in an era long past. These distinctly independent lives will be forged together by the arrival of a mysterious resident in the middle of the night. Sometimes family is created not born.
