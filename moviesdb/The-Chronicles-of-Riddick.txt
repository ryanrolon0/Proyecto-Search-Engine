The Chronicles of Riddick

 Set before the events of "Pitch Black", this game tells the story of how Richard B. Riddick obtained his ability to see in the dark. Riddick has just earned a one-way ticket to Butcher Bay, one of the hardest prisons around. Savage inmates, prison guards, and horrifying creatures will make his attempt at escaping this hellish place that much harder.
