Random Chapters in the Life of Some Guy

 A short comedy that chronicles particular days, ideas, frustrations, relationship, and fears of a normal guy just trying to get through life. From traumatizing youthful experiences to dating difficulties to political alternatives to outrageous career possibilities to frightening marriage arrangements, this guy experiences many bumps along the road that are often relatable and, sometimes, just plain bizarre. The film includes twelve chapters. Each chapter is named at its conclusion. The guy is in all of them, sometimes as himself, sometimes as a character in his imagination.
