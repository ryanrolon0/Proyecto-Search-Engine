The Painter's Voice

 In "The Painter's Voice," Academy Award-winning filmmaker William Friedkin, working with editor and producer Darrin Navarro, examines the intersection of science and art as they follow the painstaking efforts of Getty Museum conservators to restore French master Jean-Baptiste Oudry's original vision to two of his largest, most resplendent paintings.
