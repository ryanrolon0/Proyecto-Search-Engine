Put-Put Troubles

 Pluto is towing Donald and his little motorboat. He gets distracted by a frog, and the boat runs away from him. While Pluto is struggling with the frog, and then a bedspring, Donald struggles with the outboard motor, which either won't start, or when it does start, has a tendency to destroy the boat.
