The Breaks

 A Sunday in the life of Derrick King, an Irish kid raised in South Central L.A. by a Black family. He talks Black, dresses Black, and thinks of himself as Black. It's a day of disasters house, his uncle fires him, the woman he loves dismisses him as childish, the LAPD (wearing Confederate-flag shoulder patches) impounds his car and tosses him in the drunk tank, a mean dude is after him for money, he's imprisoned in a store basement by gay sadists, and he's shot at. Along the way, however, he shows kindness to a near-sighted kid, and those random acts may prove to be his salvation.
