Shuffle - Politike, laknuri dhe rokenroll

 Five years after the NATO led campaign against Yugoslav Army Troops, one million Kosovars returned to their destroyed homes and begun their daily struggle. Lack of jobs, extreme poverty, political instability, inconsistent electricity and water supply, are some of these problems. While in 1999 people were happy to find freedom, five years later they found themselves disillusioned and angry. Six alternative music bands try to express all of these emotions through music and performance.
