The Story of Bob

 Robert "Bob" Bobson has a problem, "he loves Ikea, he loves everything about it." As a boy, young Bobby was infatuated with Ikea furniture and grew up building everything from lamps and chairs to wall units. Anything and everything he could get his hands on. As little Bobby grew up, his passion for the Ikea product grew along with him and eventually led to his position with the company profile promotion, coupled with the excitement of the annual Spring Sale, caused Bob to develop a rather peculiar disorder Tourettes-Like Syndrome." The disease advanced quickly, and what started as simple ticks and spouting furniture 'profanities,' soon advanced to complete obsession, sexual dysfunction and indecent exposure. After extensive testing and no cure in site, the Ikea Corporation was compelled to remove Bob from his position and affectively suspend the annual Spring Sale indefinitely. "The Story Of Bob" provides for us an inside glance into this troubling new disorder. Through reenactments, and never before seen interviews, the filmmakers were able to explore the inner workings of Ikea Corporation and the troubling Ikea-Obsessed world of Robert Bobson.
