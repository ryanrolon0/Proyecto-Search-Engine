Samaritan

 Fact-based story about Mitch Snyder (Martin Sheen), a Washington crusader for the homeless, who took their case to Congress. Working for the Community for Creative Non-violence, Snyder became outraged at the number of homeless people who had been dumped on the Washington streets without shelter from mental institutions and other care facilities. His advocacy drew national attention to the "missing persons" that live among us. Cicely Tyson also appears as a bag-lady who teaches Snyder and his cohorts how to survive on the streets.
