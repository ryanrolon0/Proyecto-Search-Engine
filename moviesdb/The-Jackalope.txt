The Jackalope

 A shy boy, Todd, is stranded on a desolate dirt road after his brother's truck blows a tire. Seeking assistance, they arrive at a general store and come across a beautiful young girl. His bullying brother pushes him into contact with the girl. Fumbling and flustered, Todd makes a fool of himself. The shopkeeper, John, witnesses the young boy's awkwardness and gives him a lesson in taking chances. He tells a story about a mysterious creature, some hunters, and a bible salesman who finds himself the target of a double-barreled shotgun. Todd is skeptical of John's seemingly irrelevant story, but the little tale turns out to be more than just a work of fiction.
