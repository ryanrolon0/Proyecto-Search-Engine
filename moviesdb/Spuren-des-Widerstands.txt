Spuren des Widerstands

 The history of the resistance group "Willy-Fred" is a model for the possibility of rebellion against a system in which any form of opposition once seemed impossible. Its story is tightly interwoven with that of the country and still presents an obstacle to some. It reaches deep into the narrative of the Second Republic and raises questions that are highly relevant today, 70 years after the "Anschluss".
