The Jogger

 On an average Australian street lives Dave, our bath-robe wearing hero. This light comedy begins when Dave catches sight of the beautiful neighborhood jogger, and falls madly in love. The problem is Dave's a little shy and she's already attracted the attention of the local male population. In fact Dave's about the only single guy she hasn't taken for a quick jog around the block. How can Dave get rid of her menagerie of potential suitors? Will he even have the 'balls' to ask her out? Why does Dave get such a weird feeling around her?
