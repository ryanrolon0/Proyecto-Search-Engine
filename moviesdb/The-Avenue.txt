The Avenue

 Across America, many cities' independent art, music, business and cultural districts have become victims of gentrification. But, Tucson's (in)famous 4th Avenue has managed to stave off the corporate influence and maintain its long standing eclectically maverick reputation constantly in the shadow of the ever looming bureaucratic enigma of 'downtown revitalization'. How does a quarter mile stretch of outlaw merchants, musicians, artists and activists manage to thrive decade after decade as one of Tucson's most successful cultural hubs? Can they keep their soul alive or is 4th Avenue's demise inevitable in order to feed the insatiable appetite of corporate interest, cost benefit ratios, and golden opportunities as was true for its sister street, Mill Avenue in Tempe? Or, is that exactly what 4th Avenue needs?
