The Fat and Lean Comedians

 Two comedians appear upon the stage, one very fat and one very lean. They go through numerous funny evolutions. Finally the fat man goes behind the scenes and returns with a huge cannon on his shoulders, and placing the muzzle directly behind the ear of the lean comedian, he fires, and the lean comedian is blown into atoms, but suddenly comes together again. The lean comedian gets a mallet and drives the fat comedian down into the boards. He comes back in his proper shape, and they go through a funny wrestling bout. Finally a policeman attempts to lead them both away, and they mysteriously fly up through the air and disappear. The funniest ever.
