Rwanda Rises Up

 Four Canadian recording artists and producer David Bottril write and record an album in Rwanda along with local musicians. The artists are inspired by the country's incredible transformation since the genocide in 1994 and the album's beautiful music reflects the infectious positive energy which is now pervasive in that scarred land.
