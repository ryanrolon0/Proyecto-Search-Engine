Uncivilised

 A white authoress, looking for a story in the outback, is kidnapped by an Afghan slaver, betrothed to a white jungle-man, and menaced by a jealous half-caste rival, a hostile witch-doctor, his crazed-killer son, and opium smugglers! Beatrice Lynn, a young novelist,decides to penetrate the unknown Kimberly Range district to search for the mythical, she thinks, white ruler of a tribe of aborigines. A Mounted Policeman DISGUISES himself as an Afghan slave trader and, after several days of guiding the exploration party, abducts Beatrice for use as a lure to get into the forbidden territory in an effort to break up the opium-smuggling ring that keeps the natives in a state of war. The un-named policeman knows there is a white king and that the white king is seeking a white bride, but he reaches the territory only after a narrow escape from a mad-killer tracking the party. Mara, the White King, takes Beatrice as his White Queen, but does not force his attentions upon her and this impresses Beatrice no little. Meanwhile, Trask, the opium smuggler, is trapped by the policeman and, after a fierce battle between the tribe's deposed witch doctor and his son, the afore-mentioned mad-killer, with the killer's tribe at their back, Mara's warriors emerge victorious. When the Policeman, no longer posing as an Afgan slave-trader, leaves Beatrice stays in the jungle as the white ruler's white queen.
