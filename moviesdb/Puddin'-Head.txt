Puddin' Head

 Harold l. Montgomery, the scatterbrain vice-president of the United Broadcasing System, is dismayed when he learns that one-foot of the ground on which the station's imposing new structure has been built is part of the adjoining lot belonging to Judt Goober, a hillbilly girl, who could sue them for millions. Mortally afraid of his domineering, ill-tempered sister, Matilda. who is the president of the company, Montgomery decides to say nothing to her regarding the problem and, instead, takes his equally-scatterbrained son, Junior, with him to the Ozarks to talk Judy into selling the property before she learns the truth. But Judy turns out to be a hard-sell and Montgomery enlists the services of handsome Prince Karl, a frayed-at-the-cuffs but glib-of-tongue Russian who faces jail for back-alimony payments, and needs any job he can get. A New York City radio station builds a new headquarters building, but unknowingly constructs part of it on a strip of property owned by a father and daughter in rural Arkansas. The station sends some slick operators to Arkansas to buy the property from the family, but things don't turn out exactly as planned.
