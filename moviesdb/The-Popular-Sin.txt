The Popular Sin

 Yvonne Montford is a sophisticated and cultured aristocrat and, while somewhat philosophical about the many loves of her philandering husband, Philip, is also somewhat bitter about it. Yvonne finally trips him up just as he is about to leave for Biarritz with Lulu, a chorus girl. Finding the tickets in his pocket, Philip tells her they were meant for her, and he will be joining her in a few days. She heads for Biarritz and philandering Phillip gives the other ticket to Jean Corot, a writer who is quiet and trustworthy. But on the train and at the resort Yvonne and Jean are constantly thrown together, and when philandering Philip arrives a few days later, Yvonne and Jean are very much in love with each other. Philip offers Yvonne a divorce, she accepts and then she and Jean are married. But La Belle Toulaize, a Parisian actress and vamp-first-class shows up to ensure the marriage ceremony doesn't provide the 'Finis.'
