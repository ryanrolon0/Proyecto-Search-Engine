Sophie und das Hohelied

 The relationship between the strongly religious educated protagonist Sophie and her boyfriend has reached a dead end. Sophie dreams of having children pretty quick. Fred is not ready for it. He blames Sophie about her timidity and is trying to have a life as usual. Their love begins to fade. Sophie seeks for advice. Her pastor in the village comes up with perspectives in love and sexuality she never heard of before. Inspired by the Song of Solomon he preaches for an open-minded discussion about love and sexuality. Her best friend Bettina complements these perspectives by her unrestrained nature. Sophie has to prove yet whether she can learn from this in order not to lose Fred.
