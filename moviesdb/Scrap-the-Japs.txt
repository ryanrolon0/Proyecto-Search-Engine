Scrap the Japs

 Popeye is relegated to swabbing the deck on an aircraft carrier and other mundane chores, which he does in creative ways. Suddenly, a bomb drops on the ship from a cloud, and all pilots (including Popeye) scramble. Popeye eventually discovers that the "cloud" is a piece of wood camouflaging a Japanese plane, and he shoots it down. The pilot lands on a "Japanese Scrap Repair Ship" where his plane is instantly rebuilt, but Popeye lands soon after, and with the help of some spinach, makes short work of that ship and heads for the Japanese aircraft carrier nearby. He fights off the crew, using them to punch a "V" in the side of the ship, then opens it like a sardine can. At the end, he tows the captured crew in a giant birdcage made out of the scrap boats.
