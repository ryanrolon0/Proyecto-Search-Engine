Shreeman Funtoosh

 Kishore, also known as Funtoosh to his friends and family, is an unemployed loafer who falls in love with the pretty Meena. Meena's father is a crazy, but kind, scientist working on a secret formula being sponsored by an evil businessman whose son is also in love with Meena. When Kishore stumbles upon the scientists basement lab he is zapped by iron rays which turn him into a semi-hulking strongman. Later his superpowers wear off and he begins to shrink at a very rapid rate. A rare Bollywood foray into the science fiction genre done up as a comedy with the usual song and dance numbers.
