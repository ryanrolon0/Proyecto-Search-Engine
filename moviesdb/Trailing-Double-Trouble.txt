 When Moreland's henchman attack Bob Horner the Range Busters break it up. Horner dies but they get the baby Moreland was after. He must have it to become it's guardian and take control of the Horner ranch. When the henchmen catch up with Alibi, they take the baby cradle not realizing Alibi has substituted his dummy Elmer. Crash having evidence Moreland is the one they want, now has a plan to expose him. This 2nd entry in Monogram's series of 24 "Range Buster" series was remade as "The Gunman from Bodie, 1941", "Gunsmoke Mesa, 1944" and "Riders of the Dawn, 1945" with Oliver Drake somewhere in the vicinity on all four. "Crash" Corrigan, "Dusty" King and "Alibi" Terhune, the Range Busters, sight a wagon driven by Bob Horner being pursued by gunmen Kirk, Walt and Drag. The trio takes a hand and the gunmen gallop away. The runaway wagon is stopped and the dying Horner asks the Range Busters to aid his baby boy, the Bar-H Ranch and Marian and to "look out for Amos." Marian is Horner's sister and she is consulting with the Sheriff regarding the murder of her brother, two other Bar-H hands and the disappearance of her baby nephew. She says all the trouble started since the State begin to buy gravel from the ranch for the Medicine Hat Dam. Attory James Moreland is also present and states that Horner's will appointed him the baby's guardian. No such thing, of course, as Moreland is after the property for his own purposes and the killers all work for him. The Range Busters, accused of killing Horner and kidnapping the baby, have their work cut out for them.
