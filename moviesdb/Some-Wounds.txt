Some Wounds

 SOME WOUNDS is a journey through the minds of Evan and Franky, two brothers deeply wounded by a childhood tragedy. Evan's grown up to be a respectable man. A religious man. The kind of man people admire in spite of, maybe even because of his tragic youth. The same can't be said for his younger brother, Franky. Evan's paid a visit by his emotional train wreck of a sibling after a year of no communication. As expected, they have difficulty relating to and understanding one another, resulting in one more tragedy in their cancerous time line.
