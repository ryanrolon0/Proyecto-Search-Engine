The Dealer

 A teenager is the dealer in a daily poker game at his highschool. He and his friend pair up to cheat in the games, and when the stakes get higher, he must decide whether they can pull off their plan unscathed. The film is a glimpse at the life of a Woody Allen-esque highschool student who must deal with school, bullies, a crush, and his strange family.
