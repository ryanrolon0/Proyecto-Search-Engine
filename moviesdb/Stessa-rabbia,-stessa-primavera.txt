Stessa rabbia, stessa primavera

 Marco Bellocchio makes a film on the imprisonment of Aldo Moro, the leader of Christian Democrats, kidnapped and killed in Italy by the Red Brigades in the spring of 1978. What spurs an uncompromising intellectual, an "irreconcilable" film-maker to face- 25 years later - such an over-whelming and unresolved episode of Italian history? The film-making is the occasion to explore again the Seventies -the most vital and contradictory decade of our recent history- and the tragic event that was the watershed of that decade. A documentary about people, who believed that a revolution -or something like that - could still be possible, in those years, without neither arms nor arbitrary sentences. A film about people who definetely believed in a better world or at least in a better Italy.
