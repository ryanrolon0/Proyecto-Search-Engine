The Important Witness

 A public stenographer, taking private dictation, sees a gangster shot in his room and she is taken along by the killers. The gang-chief falls for her, and she plays along to lull his suspicions, and eventually makes an escape. She takes a night-bus back to Los Angeles in order to give testimony that will clear her girl-friend who has been falsely accused of the killing. But the gang pursues her and she has to take over driving the bus when the driver is shot.
