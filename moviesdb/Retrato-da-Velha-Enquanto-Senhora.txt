Retrato da Velha Enquanto Senhora

 Mrs. Julia doesn't want to walk. The house where she was born is a family labyrinth where she lets herself being pushed in a wheelchair. She has got old and most of all, she's a widow. Without a man to embrace her, she is afraid to fall. She lives surrounded by women she despises and by the precious memories of the absent men.
