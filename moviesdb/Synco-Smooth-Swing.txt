Synco-Smooth Swing

 This entry in Universal's "Name Band Musicals" series of shorts is headlined by Ted Fio-Rito (a name we will stick with until we see the first instance in which this band leader used Ted Fiorito as a billing name in a film)and his orchestra supporting singers and dancers. Gloria Delson sings "Elmer Done It Again", followed by singer Paul Carley on "Let Me Love You Tonight" while Armand & Nita dance to same. The orchestra performs "Nola" featuring a piano solo, and The Soldaires sing "Boogie Woogie Lullaby." Evelyn Farney tap dances to a Stephen Foster medley and the finale is a jump version of "Hungarian Rhapsody" by Mr. Fio-Rito's orchestra.
