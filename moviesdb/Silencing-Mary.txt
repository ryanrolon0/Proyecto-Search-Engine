Silencing Mary

 History exam questions are stolen from Cornwall University's history professor's home by Falcons football players, who nearly escape campus police. Campus paper reporter Mary keeps pushing the case. Soon after, her friend Holly Sherman gets drunk and claims to be raped at that party by star player Clay Roberts. But then retracts the accusation realizing she probably gave the wrong signals. Mary pushes even harder, even after the college finds no proof, no case, ignoring Clay's denial and turning blindly on the whole team, even the supporters. So it gets personal on both sides.
