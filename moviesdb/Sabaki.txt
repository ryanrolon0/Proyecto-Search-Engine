Sabaki

 John Ruski is a man for whom life has lost its edge. Stuck in a dead end job his days run together in a meaningless blur as he watches his life slowly ebbing away into the monotony of everyday routine. His ennui drives away his partner who seeks a life of substance away from the depressive atmosphere of a man without ambitions. This is until he chances upon a peculiar advertisement, which challenges his notions about the world around him as well as the way in which he perceives himself. Empowered by these new found beliefs John creates his own philosophy, the actions of which enable him to embrace the more primal, savage side of human nature.
