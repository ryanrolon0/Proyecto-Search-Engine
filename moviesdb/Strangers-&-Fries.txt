Strangers & Fries

 Three strangers happen to sit at the same empty local bar one night. All of them feel quite miserable for different reasons, the bar finally comes to life when the two guys sitting at the bar get into an argument about "blaming other people for their own miseries". The situation becomes even more tense when bartender Nicky has a freak out upon their argument, and the quiet guy sitting in the corner tries to get his Veggie burger order straight, and killing everybody else's last nerve.. A character study..
