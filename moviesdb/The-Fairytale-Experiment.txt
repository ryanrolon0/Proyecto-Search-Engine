The Fairytale Experiment

 Charlotte Gaspard and Rose Robin, undertake the feat of organizing a road trip around the USA, to prove that it is possible to be a self sufficient performance group in America. Without really knowing what they were in for, Charlotte bought a yellow school bus and named it 'Lunette, The Fairytale Express'. She had no real knowledge about buses, she didn't know what a lug wrench was, let alone think to buy a spare tire. Rose films the road trip holding the camera off her shoulder, having never filmed before. The Fairy-Tale Experiment is a band of artists from different places and cultures, who traveled for 4 months together performing around the USA meeting other artists and improvising with them. The documentary brings to light what's happening in each state they traveled though and shows a side of America and Americans you don't see very often.
