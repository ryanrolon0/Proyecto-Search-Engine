The Hairy Hands

 Dartmoor moorland...1000 ghosts...and a fugitive racing a haunted road to meet one. 'The Hairy Hands' is the fourth in the series of 'Penny Dreadful' animations inspired by neglected aspects of English folklore. A haunted house movie set in a moving car and based upon a genuine Dartmoor legend it draws upon such influences as Alfred Hitchcock, EC Comics and 'The Hammer House of Horror'.
