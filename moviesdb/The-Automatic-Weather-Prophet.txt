The Automatic Weather Prophet

 Two small boys have constructed a device over a fence camouflaged by a poster. A rose is painted on the poster as well as the words "The Automatic Weather Prophet." Three people are intrigued by the sign. One is a large fat man who attempts to catch the two boys but is unable to get through the narrow slot in the fence. The other two men also receive red paint through a squirt mechanism behind the rose as well as a punch in the nose from a boxing glove on a pole
