Rastro de muerte

 During the 1930's a very honest man (Villamosa) is sent as Regional Delegate from the Capital City to Yucatan State (a very afar city). Once there he finds a deep corrupted burocracy, leaded by the Govermernor's Secretary (Torres). When the Governor discovers this, fires Torres, but then he leads a military movement that end with the assasination of the governor. Torres offers the place to Villamosa treating him as a puppet. He accepts trying to remove the corruption, but he finds more problems than he thinks.
