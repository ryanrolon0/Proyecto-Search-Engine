Silencio Fuerte

 A raw and brutally honest portrayal of an angry and foul mouthed Latina named Karla, who desperately needs to leave her violent mother but falls deeper into darkness trying to get out. Set in a run-down, gritty Latino neighborhood, Silencio Fuerte is an uncompromising look at lower class struggles and the absence of human connection.
