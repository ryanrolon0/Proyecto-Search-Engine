Shakey Grounds

 For Max Preston, coffee is everything. It is his obsession, his love, his life. Max travels across the country from Chicago to Shakey Grounds. A coffee shop full of Los Angeles freaks and Hollywood geeks, Shakey Grounds, is a coffee shop like no other. It snubs those who frequent the mass marketed coffee shops. It mocks the hilarity of the LA scene. It brews over 37 different types of international blends and to Max it i s the best place.
