 In his fight for innovation in a industrial plant, professor Olteanu discovers through lab research a new technique that can be very helpful in turning the iron ore into better steel and other metal products. His experiments don't always give the best results especially when he is "helped" in his endeavors by a conspirator. His wife and his collaborator help to unmask the conspirator and convince the professor to continue his work. In the end the conspirators face harsh punishment and his techniques are given patents and turned into successful industrial processes.
