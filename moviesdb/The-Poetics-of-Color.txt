The Poetics of Color

 This documentary is not only a history of one contemporary artist's journey, but a celebration of the Asian contribution to American contemporary art.The film explores the life and work of the noted Indian painter Natvar Bhavsar. Born in Gujarat in 1934, Bhavsar settled in New York City, the very nerve center of the art world, in the mid-1960s where he still lives and works. The central theme of the film is the multicultural nature of Bhavsar's work and how that has influenced the trajectory of his career. Although it's common today for artists to work cross-culturally and find critical and commercial acceptance outside their own spheres of origin, Bhavsar was a pioneer who paved the way for subsequent generations of artists.
