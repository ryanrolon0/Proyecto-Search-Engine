The Bing Crosby Show

 As this is Bing Crosby's first television special, comedian Jack Benny with his latest girlfriend Crystal Pond (aka dancer Sheree North) drop by to provide a few pointers. Bing sings five tunes, starting with the big production number "Y'all Come!" backed by The Cass County Boys and Jud Conlon's Rhythmaires.
