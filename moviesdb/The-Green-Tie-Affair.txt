The Green Tie Affair

 'The Green Tie Affair' is a short musical about accepting your identity. Hickey Pine is a puppet living in a human world. Every day, he sports a flashy green necktie and receives nothing but great compliments from his friends and neighbors. One day, an admirer of his, Vixie, takes a snapshot of Hickey wearing his green tie and publishes it in a local newspaper. Days go by and Hickey begins to notice that everyone around him is now wearing a green tie on a regular basis, causing Hickey to go into a state of depression, rudely rejecting Vixie's harmless advances towards him. At the height of his depression, Hickey is kidnapped by the villainous Miss Plaid and her less-than-enthusiastic assistant Roo. Miss Plaid, whose goal in life is to increase people's interest in plaid, explains how the community's fascination with green ties will soon get old, allowing them to turn to her for fashion advice. Hickey realizes that he is a role model of sorts and escapes Miss Plaid's clutches with the intention of making up with Vixie. The final scenes involves Hickey explaining to Vixie through song how important she is in in life.
