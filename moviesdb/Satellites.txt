Satellites

 The unending vast space of the universe. The furthest anyone can be from life. Brandon is being documented by a fellow college student for a capstone project. Brandon lacks all drive and purpose for life since he lost his parents years ago. He has been moving from foster home to foster home for most of his life, but has now finally reached the freedom of college. With a fading interest in space and science, Brandon meets someone that will change his life forever. As this real life documentary unfolds, the cameraman behind it all reveals his identity and purpose for this project, sending Brandon's life into a whirlwind of twisted realities. Satellites is not your conventional story.
