The News Reporter

 Once, John Marks reported on politics and believed in truth and in freedom of the press. But now it is the year 2028, and free elections are a thing of the past. His newspaper has been reduced to a catalog of meaningless news, and his assignments are limited to covering local happenings and trivial events. In one week, everything changes when Harold, John's editor and long-time friend, asks him to cover a recent outbreak of political vandalism. He is expected to vilify the perpetrators but goes against the grain when he simply reports the news. When he gets a chance to meet the gang responsible for the vandalism, he must choose between the security of his job and what may be his last chance to regain the sense of purpose he once held as a reporter. Harold, meanwhile, becomes torn between loyalty to his friend and his obligations to his job. As John gets closer to the gang, the stakes get higher than anyone imagined.
