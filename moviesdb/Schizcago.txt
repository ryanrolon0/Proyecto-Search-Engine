Schizcago

 Schizo Cool follows a bohemian bicycle gang-Lacey, Morris, Sandy and Renee-who rake in cash as clinical trial guinea pigs, fetish workers and youth consumer consultants. When Lacey gets eyeballs implanted in her wrists, and Morris convinces a major corporation to pioneer a new model for retail, the cohort uses the opportunity to take partying to a whole new level.
