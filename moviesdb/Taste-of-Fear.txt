Taste of Fear

 Three people, connected in a sprawling, busy city, each about to taste danger. They're about to taste raw hate and ruthless violence. They're each about to get a taste of fear. Hanga is a man who's fled thousands of miles from political violence, only to realize he has become an obsessive avenger. Gwen is the best in the business at what she does, but when someone else's mistake turns her world upside down, she must use beauty and sensuality to let her slip through a tightening circle. And Peter is a lonely businessman who seems to have uncanny insight into what makes others tick. Maybe he uses this skill for something besides pick-up lines.
