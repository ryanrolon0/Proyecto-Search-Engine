Swing, Sister, Swing

 Broadway press agent Nap Sisler sees a chance to make a national hit with a new dance, "The Baltimore Bubble", created by Greenvale filling-station attendant Johnny Bennett. Nap promotes dance instructor Professor L. Orlando Beebee out of $500 to bring Johnny, his dancing partner Snookie Saunders, and Greenvale grocery clerk and hot trombonist Satchel-Lips Peters to New York. Introduced at a night club by band leader Ted Weems, the trio is a hit. The Greenvale trio begin a theatre tour with their dance, now a national sensation. The craze soon dies out and Johnny stays in New York to try for another chance at fame with a dancer, Nona, while the other two return to Greenvale. The new act soon flops and Johnny returns to Greenvale and is met by Snookie, Satchel-Lips and the town band, who escort him to a new and lavish service station built with the money earned from "The Baltimore Bubble."
