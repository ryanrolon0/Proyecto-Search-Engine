Pyjama Jump

 Documentary short about the University of Sheffield's infamous Pyjama Jump, where the students invade Sheffield's city centre each November dressed in drag. The idea behind it is to raise money for different charities, but the evening generally ends up with the students drinking lots of alcohol, causing a lot of mischief and mayhem, and having a lot of sex. This particular year, it follows two second-year students, Alex and Adam, as they prepare to hit the town.
