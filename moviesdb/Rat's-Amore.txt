Rat's Amore

 "Rat's Amore is a hi-jinx filled buddy-buddy cartoon with a generous helping of heart, soul, spirit and gags. This series aims for the funny bone as well as the heart strings chronicling the life, times and misadventures of Sonny and Fredo, two rats from Italy, who are world class chefs. "Rat's Amore" is sure to satisfy all size appetites as our Heroes bake, baste, broil, roast, fillet, chop and mince their way through the great American melting pot.
