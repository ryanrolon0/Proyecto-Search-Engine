Secret Valley

 Rancher Lee Rogers allows Jean Carlo/Collins to hide out on his Reno ranch until she can get a divorce from racketeer "Slick" Collins, who tricked her into a marriage. She accompanies Lee on a cattle round-up and innocently causes a stampede that puts Lee into danger of losing his ranch, due to the crooked work of lawyer Austin Martin who is in league with Collins. Jean gives a check to Lee's friend, Russell Parker, to pay off the note and makes him pretend he has arranged a loan from the bank. Collins and his henchmen catch up with Jean, and fearing that her husband will kill Lee, she agrees to accompany him back to New York. But Federal Men are on the trail of Collins for income-tax evasion.
