Swimming in Nebraska

 An essay-documentary of what I suppose most would call an experimental kind. It is meant as an oblique critique of the kind of provincialism in which New Yorkers or Parisians or Angelinos say things like, 'Nebraska, there's nothing there.' This film is a celebration of the provincialism where there's 'nothing.' A rich tapestry of color, ideas, and a kind of spirituality. An electronic essay.
