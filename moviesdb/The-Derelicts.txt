The Derelicts

 Death before dishonor is the choice of a young factory girl, but she is saved from both by a young sea captain and turned into another life, in which she seems happy until an old enemy reappears in the person of her former employer, whose business interests have brought him to the far corner of the world where the new Eden is. The strange circumstances of his coming, the discovery of the serpent in that paradise, and the rapid series of events which culminate in the vengeance of the sea, form the second half of this dramatic story.
