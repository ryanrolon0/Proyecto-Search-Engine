Sex 'n' Death

 Ben Black is the host of a popular television program that aims to shock and outrage its audience, which continues to tune in even though most of them think they are 'above it.' But Ben's cruel persona as TV host often continues after the cameras are turned off and his ex-lover / current producer, his co-workers, and his lover are often at the receiving end of his barbs.
