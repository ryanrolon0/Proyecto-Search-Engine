The Gay Desperado

 Opera singer Chivo is currently playing a singing cowboy, and Mexican bandito Braganza kidnaps him (along with Jane, an heiress) so he can learn to become more like the American movie gangsters he admires. Lots of songs including "Cielito lindo", "Adios mi tierra", "The World is Mine Tonight" and "Celeste Aida."
