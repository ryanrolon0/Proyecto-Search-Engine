Somethin' Grand

 Madeleine tells her story in her own words in the included exclusive documentary, featuring footage and interviews with her in Paris and New York. This intimate portrait also features interviews with Madeleine's mother, long time producer Larry Klein, the man who found her Yves Beauvais, co-writer David Batteau, voice coach Joan Lader, musician and friend Danny Fitzgerald and Wall Street Journal writer Christopher J Farley. These interviews, archive footage and live performances build a insight into an artist in full flow and at the height of her powers.
