Restless Desire

 Jack is returning home to visit his estranged dying father. With him is his gold-digging wife, Karen, who is only interested in the money Jack may inherit. Jack left this place years ago in search of himself. Now he is back in hopes of finding the things he left behind in his youthful carelessness, including a relationship with his father, and the love for Susan, the woman who married his brother Ralph the day Jack left home.
