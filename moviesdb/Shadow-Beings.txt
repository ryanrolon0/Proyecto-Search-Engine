Shadow Beings

 The Evil Ones have been trapped in-between the worlds for millennia. They cannot cross the veil that separates our physical world from their realm without help from this side. During a sEance, lead by En'Kara, five friends unwittingly open a portal through the veil, which helps the Evil Ones to take possession of humans. Those who are unable to take a host appear as shadow beings, fleeting glimpses unable to manifest physically. Brien follows a shadow being through the veil to a parallel universe. He ends up finding his chase, Enki, who relates to him the philosophy on true nature of the universe. Brien learns that he has been charged with stopping the Evil Ones from crossing over before the number of their entities reaches critical mass, thus bringing down the veil. The possessed Aliester tries one last time to help his brethren cross over the veil. Brien thwarts his efforts by changing reality as he becomes one with the veil. Without the veil, there is no separation of the manifest from the unmanifest; the order of our universe would revert to the chaos before creation.
