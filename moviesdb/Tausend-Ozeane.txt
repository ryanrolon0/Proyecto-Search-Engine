Tausend Ozeane

 Five friends spend their holidays on a faraway island in the sea. On the last day of the holidays, out of the blue, Björn informs his friends that he will not return home but intends to stay in this paradise forever. There is no sign of life from Björn after that. His best friend Meikel is very concerned about the mysterious disappearance - but nobody cares and no one helps him in his search for the lost friend. Twenty-four years old Meikel Willer is forced to leave his best friend Björn on the Maledives because freedom-loving Björn has decided not to return back to everyday life. Back home, Meikel realizes that something must have happened while he was away. But his family doesn't communicate about it. Meikel, who always wanted to fulfill his parent's expectations, feels more and more like a misfit. Especially his father, who had always favored him, treats him inexplicably hostile. They advise him not to bring back Björn. Meikel becomes curious and wants to find out what secret lies behind Björn's refusal to return. But as his brother Eric slightly opens up to him, Meikel manages to reconstruct piece by piece. And the closer he gets to the hidden secret of Björn, the more he realizes that he is on the run from his own family. He understands that he doesn't have to rescue Björn but himself. Meikel faces up to the demons of his childhood with all his power to finally be able to go the way he avoided his whole life. His last decision is so serious that it could even destroy his family's life forever. And then, on a desert road in the wood, a fatal car accident happens in which four of five young people die right away.
