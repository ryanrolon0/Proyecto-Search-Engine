Until Dust

 With the ideas of 'fictionalizing' history I wanted to comment on the fact that cinema lends itself to this methodology, creating fantastic situations rife with artifice to communicate the mundane, a man and a woman well into their adult lives falling in love. While there are so many ways to express this idea, I wanted to explore the selflessness of love by showing the extremity of sacrifice, exemplified on my parents relationship.
