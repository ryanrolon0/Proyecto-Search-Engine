Trikal

 Set in 1961 Goa, this is a story of a rich and influential Goan family and what happens to them over a period of time. The movie is narrated in past-tense by one of the friends of the family. Circa 1961 Dona Maria Souzasoares lives a wealthy lifestyle in Portuguese-occupied Goa in post-independent India along with her husband, Ernesto; a daughter, Silvia, her husband, Lucio, and their two daughters Aurora and Anna. Also living in this household as a maidservant is Milagrenia, the illegitimate daughter of Ernesto, who was sired due to one of his many indiscretions with a variety of maidservants. When Ernesto passes away, Maria is beside herself with grief and seeks the help of Milagrenia to speak with her late husband's spirit, but instead ends up summoning the vengeful spirit of Vijay Singh Rane, who was beheaded at the behest of Ernesto's maternal grandfather in place of Kustoba Rane. While Silvia is overly anxious to get Anna married to Erasmo, who is studying medicine and has a very bright future, but is afraid of losing him if Maria delays the marriage. This does not happen, and Maria consents to the engagement, and it is on that fateful day when everyone finds out that Anna and Milagrenia are pregnant. Anna has three suitors, Erasmo, Ruiz Pereira, the paternal nephew of Dr. Pereira, and Leon Gonsalves, a freedom fighter fugitive, but it is unknown who may have been responsible for Milagrenia's plight. Watch what impact this news has on the entire family, what they do to resolve this situation amidst the blockade by Indian troops in order to force the Portuguese to leave India.
