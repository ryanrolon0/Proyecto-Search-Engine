Stalker

 Two guys and three girls decide to go out into the woods for a night of innocent fun. While talking amongst themselves, they quickly realize that they are not alone. Unaware of what hell is coming their way, they decide to go deeper inside the woods, seemingly away from what is terrorizing them. Quickly figuring out that the evil is all around them, they fight for their lives in an all-out-attempt to get out of the woods alive.
