Spats

 After years of hiding, estranged from his only son, Spats now lives the life of a nomadic recluse, keeping a close eye on things back home through trusted friends from the past. However, things have changed and enemies have converged to lure Spats back for an untimely demise. They kidnap and brutalize his son, Ronnie, a widely admired up-and-coming rap artist, forcing him into addiction and violence. When Spats gets the news from his flies on the wall, all bets are off as this godfather of the streets must return to the old neighborhood to seek vengeance on an overdue bill, only to be paid in blood. Further complicating things are his rejected attempts to reconcile with his son, balancing between defiance and success, ands yet to become the man his father knows he can be. Wheels, deals and thrills abound in this throwback to blaxploitation featuring the genre's trend-setting stars in which Spats has to wreck the streets to make them whole again.
