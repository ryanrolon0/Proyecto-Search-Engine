Speak Heaven

 Through a streaming of inner consciousness, Grace paints the world of stories that have echoed through human history for centuries, revealing to her brother Gabriel who she feels she truly is and what that will mean to the fate of the world. We follow her on her quest through the expressions of a Greenwich Village artist to reveal the identity of the Blue Woman in her visions--a coming Goddess said to be the savior of mankind. Inspired by Lord Alfred Tennyson's poem of the Arthurian Legend 'The Lady of Shalot.'
