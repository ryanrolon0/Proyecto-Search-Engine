Stackars lilla Sven

 Poppe plays Sven, an orphan who is being taken care of by the kind Mr. Carlsson. However, when Carlsson remarries a baroness, life becomes hard for Sven. The baroness and her two sons do all they can to make it so. The daughter (Anna-Lisa Ericsson) of their even richer neighbour is mistaken for the new house-maid and she helps Sven get ready for the ball that her father is having, while she and Sven secretly fall in love with each other.
