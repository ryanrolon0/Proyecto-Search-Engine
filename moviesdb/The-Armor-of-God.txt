The Armor of God

 A short film that follows six teenage friends as they face stress of grades and schools, high expectations, selfishness, bullies, and peer pressure to go to a party with alcohol. Can the kids navigate through it? Will they make it through or will they let these worldly things take them down? Will they turn to the only one and the only book that can help them find out what is right? Will loving caring adults come help them make sense of the crazy teen world or will they have to navigate it alone? Will they put on the armor or will they leave it behind?
