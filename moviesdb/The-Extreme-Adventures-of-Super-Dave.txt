The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave

 After a backfiring stunt and a mishap-filled New Year's Eve 1999, klutzy and legendary stuntman Super Dave Osborne decides to hang up the crash helmet and retire. Coupled with financial problems, a double-crossing protEgE' named D.J., and slimy promoter and arch-nemesis Gil Ruston, things do not look good for the super one. However, he meets klutzy mother Sandy and her son Timmy, who has a heart condition, who he immediately takes a shine to. When D.J.'s taunting prompts Timmy to attempt to jump a ramp with his bicycle (and fail), he aggravates his heart condition and requires an operation, forcing Super Dave to accept an offer from Ruston to do a stunt to get the necessary money for Timmy's operation.
