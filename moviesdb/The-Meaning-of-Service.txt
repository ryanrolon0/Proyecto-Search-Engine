The Meaning of Service

 Every year 20 disabled veterans from around the country are chosen to spend 9 days at Florida State University learning how to become entrepreneurs in the Entrepreneurship Boot camp for Veterans Program. The goal of the program is to help to the veterans transition back into society after their service careers are over. 'The Meaning of Service' is a short documentary on the EBV Program and how it has given hope to hundreds of disabled veterans.
