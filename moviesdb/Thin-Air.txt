Thin Air

 A whimsical tale chronicling the final days of Hector. Seated in a wheelchair parked on the roof of his apartment building, Hector flings fishing lines into the cold heights of New York City. He bids his time for the impossible catch, whilst reality bites in the form of Cecilia, his home-care aide. 'Thin Air' is not simply an elegy to solitude. Sometimes the quieter one's world is, the harder one dreams and sometimes the universe hears you.
