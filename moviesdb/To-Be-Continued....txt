 Five minutes. A girl's doll carriage rolls toward a busy street while her father ignores her to talk to a friend; an impatient husband waits for his wife to cook his egg; lovers enjoy a last embrace as a man - her husband? - climbs the stairs. The friends part and the father looks for his daughter; the egg timer rings; the husband returns. Five minutes are almost up, but little is as we expect it.
