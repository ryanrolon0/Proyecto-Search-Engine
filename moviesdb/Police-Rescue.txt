Police Rescue

 Constable Laurie Gordon transfers from the Drugs Squad to Sydney's elite Police Rescue squad after her partner and lover is killed when a raid goes wrong. When allegations of corruption follow her to Rescue, Gordon must fight to regain the vital trust of the squad and Sgt. 'Mickey' McClintock. This trust is tested when a gunman takes a teacher and kids hostage at a child care centre, and the Rescue Squad is called in to assist. Based on the Australian ABC-TV series.
