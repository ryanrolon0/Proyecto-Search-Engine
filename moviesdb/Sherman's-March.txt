Sherman's March

 Sherman Skyler is a young man on a mission. Sentenced to a forensic mental hospital, he quickly impresses the staff with his sharp intellect and eccentric personality. Sherman's release would be imminent, except for one lingering hang-up many lowbrow books, which he firmly believes are poisoning the minds of fellow residents. When Sherman ends up nearly destroying one patient's psyche - as well as the library restroom - doctors invite his brother Shep for a visit to help ease Sherman's mind. In a relentless pursuit of literacy, Sherman has other plans.
