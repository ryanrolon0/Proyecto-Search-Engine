Utopia X

 X-1568, a lonely creature desperately yearning for some company is visited by a synthetic outer space organism who grants him the ability to plunge into a new world of illusion where time is in a constant state of flux. Thus Z-8266 is born, a fantasy figure made of pure energy and relentless desire whose sole purpose is the satisfaction of X-1568's incessant lust for love.
