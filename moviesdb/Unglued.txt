Unglued

 Paul, a man in his mid thirties, is living the life he futilely thought would finally bring him happiness, but he has found only despair. He is called upon again to come to his estranged wife's aid when she believes their daughter is missing. On the journey, he stops to help Lucy, a girl having car trouble. As Paul and Lucy talk, he begins to loose his grip on reality. Lucy's intentions begin to come into question, and their chance encounter by the roadside seems less and less a coincidence. Paul begins to realize that something is very wrong. Why is this stranger doing these things to him, and who is she really? Paul's life unravels as he searches for answers, and comes face to face with a brutal truth buried in delusions.
