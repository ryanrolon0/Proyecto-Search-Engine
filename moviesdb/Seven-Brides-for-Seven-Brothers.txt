Seven Brides for Seven Brothers

 Adam, the eldest of seven brothers, goes to town to get a wife. He convinces Milly to marry him that same day. They return to his backwoods home. Only then does she discover he has six brothers - all living in his cabin. Milly sets out to reform the uncouth siblings, who are anxious to get wives of their own. Then, after reading about the Roman capture of the Sabine women, Adam develops an inspired solution to his brothers' loneliness. On one of his few trips into town per year, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee has a larger shopping list than usual. On his shopping list this time is a wife, not only a beautiful woman, but one that can cook and clean and transform his pigsty of a farm into a real home. Against the odds, he does find one in the form of Millie, the headstrong cook at the local inn. For her, it's love at first sight. Upon arriving at Adam's farm in the Oregon mountains, Millie finds her new lot in life is not only as loving wife, but housemaid to Adam's six brothers, who all live at the farm. The Pontipee's are rough and tumble and ill mannered as they haven't been exposed to much in life outside their remote farm. Adam's new life and a trip into town themselves inspires the six brothers to find wives of their own. Adam and Millie each have differing views on how best to achieve the brothers' collective wish. As the six unmarried brothers strive to achieve their goal, Adam may lose his in taking his wife for granted.
