Si liang bo qian jin

 A criminal monk leaves the Shaolin monastery on a brutal rampage that terrorizes the county. A massive manhunt quickly pursues him. Meanwhile, Chow, an amorous young man, is caught with lovely Tin Shun by her angry father who orders him hanged. But kung-fu master Lin, a marshal on the trail of the outlaw monk, halts the illegal execution. Chow promises Lin to help track the fugitive in exchange for kung-fu lessons. Now, in disguise, the renegade monk begins to plot master Lin's murder until Chow discovers his identity, provoking a final one-on-one showdown between two equally-skilled masters of the martial arts.
