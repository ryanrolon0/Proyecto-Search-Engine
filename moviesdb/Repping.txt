Repping

 Mike, a burned out sales legend, and Toby, a newly hired sales assistant with a hidden agenda, hit the road on the way to a Machinery World sales expo. Their goal is to close the largest ball-bearings contract ever landed with the U.S Government. Their goal hits some serious snags thanks in no small way to Kate Douglass, a former Goth girl sales assistant turned mega machinery parts sales magnate with a wicked golf shot and a back filled with Yakuza-like tattoos. Who's got the balls to win this raunchy funny romp in the world of sales and government contracts?
