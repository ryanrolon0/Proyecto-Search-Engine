Something Better

 Boozing and drug abusing Sam decides to get his life together and become an art dealer, but his brother and criminal partner, Eddy, and his ball busting alcholic wife, Sally have enough dirt on him to send him to prison if he should so much as think of leaving them. Sam falls in love with a philosophy teacher who teaches him an important lesson - that things aren't always what they seem, and that perspective can reshape reality.
