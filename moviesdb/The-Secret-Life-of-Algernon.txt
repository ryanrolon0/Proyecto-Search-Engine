The Secret Life of Algernon

 Algernon is an old man who lives alone, having conversations with a porcelain cat and enjoys making things out of bones... he boils a neighbor's dead dog for the bones... and he is visited by an old friend who is dying of ailments and thus commits suicide, leaving a million dollars in a suitcase. A woman claiming to be interested in Algernon's Egyptologist great grandfather pretends to be in love with Algernon... and he almost falls for it.
