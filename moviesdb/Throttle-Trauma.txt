Throttle Trauma

 Asphalt Junkiez is extremely proud to announce a motorcycle stunt documentary entitled "Throttle Trauma." This film is the equivalent of a "for dummies" book. If you don't have a clue what motorcycle stunt riding is all about, or what drives these perfectionists day after day, crash after crash, to keep on going, this film gives you an insider's perspective of the sport. Vancouver hasn't been known as a thriving motorcycle stunt city, until now. The local street bike scene is growing rapidly and so is this unorthodox sport. While the general public may view this as hooligan behavior on machines that exceed reasonable power, growing numbers of people consider it a challenging exercise in flawless control.
