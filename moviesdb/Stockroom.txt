Stockroom

 Samio (Hero Angeles) is left at home with his niece Naya (Maira Angela). By accident, they disturb an element of the past while inside a stockroom. This incident sparks the beginning of the spirits' intrusion into their lives. Samio and Naya find themselves trapped in the past, present and future of other dimensions while the angry spirits take revenge on them. As the spirits continue to haunt them in their dreams as well as in reality, there seems to be no way out for Samio and Naya.
