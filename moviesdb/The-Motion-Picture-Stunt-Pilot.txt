The Motion Picture Stunt Pilot

 This Movietone Special (in CimemaScope) shows famed-stunt pilot Paul Mantz exhibiting some of his most well-known stunts such as flying through hangars. Since most of his most daring stunts were in B&W films and not in CinemaScope, most of the footage is Mantz duplicating stunts from the past.
