TekTek

 TekTek is the story of Mark (Josh Grossberg), a 13 year-old boy addicted to the Internet, and especially text-based on-line "chatting." Taking the on-line nickname of TekTek, he's up half the night - or longer - chatting with his many on-line friends. In the morning, his mother finds him asleep at the computer. He doesn't have any friends in the 'real' world - they're all on-line. His mother's efforts to encourage him to make 'real' friends meets with hostility on-line friends every bit as real and important as the in-person variety. His obsession grows as he develops an intense relationship with an on-line girlfriend. TekTek, though, is in for a shocking dose of reality as he discovers that his chat friends - including his on-line girlfriend - aren't who they say they are.
