Samba

 Singer Laura Monteiro (Montiel) is murdered by her old protector João Fernandes de Oliveira (Giachetti), who has found out her love affair with Assis (Carlos Alberto). Favela-girl BelEn (also Montiel) is the look-alike who takes her place, unaware she is being used by a gang that smuggles precious stones sewn in Carnival costumes.
