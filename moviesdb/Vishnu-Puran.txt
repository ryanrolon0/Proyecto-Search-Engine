Vishnu Puran

 Beautiful Gandharva Kanya invites the wrath of Gandharav Raj Ambuj when she decides to take the advise of Devi Maa Gauri and get married to a Manav, Dharamketu. Ambuj soon humiliates and blinds Dharamketu, and the only way he can regain his sight is by listening to Vishnu Puran, and how Bhagwan Shri Vishnu came to Earth in the past nine Avtars and the future Avtar of Kalki. (Matsya - Fish; Kurma - Turtle; Varanha - Boar; Narsimh - Lion; Vamana - Alm-seeking sage; Bhagwan Shri Parshuram; Bhagwan Shri Ram; Bhagwan Shri Kishan; and Bhagwan Shri Kalki). Madhavi, in her haste to restore her husband's sight, will ultimately lose him to Rajkanya; she will then give birth to Gopal - only to lose him also; and be eventually sentenced to death at the hands of none other than Arya himself on the charge of abducting and killing the regions children.
