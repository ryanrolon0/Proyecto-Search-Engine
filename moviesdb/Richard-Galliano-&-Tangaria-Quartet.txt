Richard Galliano & Tangaria Quartet

 Made in Marciac, a quaint sleepy town in southern France, in the summer of 2006 during the annual Jazz Festival, the film shows Richard Galliano at his best. Galliano describes the concert he gave that year as one of his most beautiful. It contains astonishing performances by himself and his fellow quartet members Alexis Cardenas - violin, Philippe Aerts - double bass, and Rafal Mejias - percussion and also includes a special guest appearance by Brazilian mandolin virtuoso Hamilton de Holanda.
