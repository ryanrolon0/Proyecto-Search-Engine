The Ballroom

 A person doesn't just stumble into the Sonic Ballroom, he or she seeks it out. It's a place that some people affectionately call a shit hole. On a corner in the city of Cologne this DIY music venue has created a vibrant community and history over the last ten years. It's a place that will just make you feel whole, and make you listen to a lot of punk music.
