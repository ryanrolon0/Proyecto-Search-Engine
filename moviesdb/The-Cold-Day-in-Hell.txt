The Cold Day in Hell

 Short-timer Cecil Mills is nothing more than an old school paramedic ready to retire and get away from what he hates most -- people. Suddenly, new field supervisor Lilith Valdis demands that Cecil train new paramedic Gabriel for his final evaluation. Cecil boasts that it will be a 'cold day in Hell' before he'll train another rookie and demands his final paycheck. But Cecil soon learns that his final evaluation is more than final.
