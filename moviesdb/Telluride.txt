Telluride

 Whisperin' Jim owns the valley floor (west of Telluride, Colorado), and a greedy development company wants to own it. With the aid of Whisperin' Jim's grandson (Tom), a sinister plot is devised to kill Whisperin' Jim before he changes his will, cutting his grandson out, and declaring the valley floor 'forever wild'.
