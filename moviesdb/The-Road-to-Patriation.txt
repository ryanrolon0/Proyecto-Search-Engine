The Road to Patriation

 This film concentrates on the politicking and lobbying that finally led to Canada's patriation in 1982. It took over a century of haggling by successive federal and provincial governments to agree on a formula to bring home the Canadian Constitution from England. Principal players in this documentary are federal Minister of Justice Jean ChrEtien, Prime Minister Trudeau, ten provincial premiers and a host of journalists, politicians, lawyers, and diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic. The film examines the motives of some of the chief actors in this important historical event.
