Sword of the Avenger

 In 1827, in the Philippines, Robert Balagtas, is framed by his romantic rival and condemned to prison without trial. Years later, he escapes, finds a hidden treasure and returns to Manila a rich man. He generously distributes and shares his wealth among the natives that have been oppressed for so long by their Spanish rulers. His past is eventually discovered by the authorities, but he exposes their thieving ways to the government, and settles down for a happy life with Maria Louise.
