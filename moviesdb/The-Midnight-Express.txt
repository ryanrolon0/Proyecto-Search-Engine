The Midnight Express

 Created out of a desire to see more worthwhile films made for young audiences, "The Midnight Express" is a modern-day fairy tale with a story that appeals to children of all ages. Shot on 16m black and white film and cut together by hand, the film is crafted to offer its viewers a round-trip ticket from a young boy's bedroom to a world of fantasy. Encouraging audiences to look for the magic in their own lives, "The Midnight Express" will remind you that childhood is as much a ride as it is a journey. Telling the story of young Charlie Foster and the overnight express train rerouted through his bedroom, "The Midnight Express" shows the lengths a six year old boy will go to in order to get a good night's sleep. When his parents won't believe him and the City Planner insists a train hasn't gone through his bedroom for years, Charlie takes matters into his own hands to derail the train conductor's plans once and for all. Using a style all its own, "The Midnight Express" illustrates that nothing is ever what it seems and that while your thoughts are worth only a penny, your imagination is priceless.
