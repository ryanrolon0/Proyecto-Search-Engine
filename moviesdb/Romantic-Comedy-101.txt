Romantic Comedy 101

 Ambitious young script writer Igor Sullivan, who just lost his lover, concentrates on a romantic comedy. He gets advice from seasoned professional James Ford, who explains the 'fomula' way, while Igo keeps insisting on artistic input of his own. Thus they draft piece by piece, often after dropping or amending the first version, a (not quite) standard triangle. It involves Internet firm colleagues Patrick, the good boy, and his womanizing buddy Mark Gibson, the vixen being the firm's new consultant Jennifer.
