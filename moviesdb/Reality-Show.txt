Reality Show

 In search of instant celebrity, an eccentric millionaire bankrolls his own amateur reality show. When the female contestants realize they've been duped into fulfilling one man's sexual fantasy, they band together and rise up against him. Using actual footage from the doomed 2003 production of 'Rock The Party', this documentary exposes a darker side of reality TV that is bizarre, unsettling and completely true.
