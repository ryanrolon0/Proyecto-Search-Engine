Seven Guns to Mesa

 A band of outlaws, led by "Papa" Clellan, hold up in a ghost town as they plan an attack on a wagon train loaded with gold. The unexpected arrival of a stagecoach forces the gang to hold the passengers and driver as hostages. The later arrival of a wanderer, John Trey, sets in motion events not in "Papa" Clellan's original plan.
