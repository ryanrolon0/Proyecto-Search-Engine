 After 25 years in the fast food business, father McDermott one morning proclaims in front of his three sons that he hated dealing with chickens all the time, and that's why he sold the restaurant last afternoon. For his sons, who counted on taking it over some time, this comes as a shock. With the oldest son Brian moving out in rage and frustration, the family starts breaking apart. Will they manage to rearrange their lives and reconcile with their parents?
