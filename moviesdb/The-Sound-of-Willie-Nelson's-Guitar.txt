The Sound of Willie Nelson's Guitar

 Filmed on location in Alberta "The Sound Of Willie Nelson's Guitar" tells the story of Bobby Johnston, a Canadian peace-keeper who finds himself lost and stranded in a field with a dying Rebel Soldier. Separated by language and allegiance the two men struggle to survive, comforted only by what Bobby regards as the most beautiful sound on earth, the sound of Willie Nelson's guitar.
