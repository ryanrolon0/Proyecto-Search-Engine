The Auction Block

 Bob Wharton marries Lorelei Knight, a beauty contest winner. While on their honeymoon, Bob is laughingly abducted by the flirtatious Bernice Lane, who keeps Bob out way past his bedtime (and his rising time, too). Lorelei, having somehow gotten the wrong idea, returns to her North Carolina home alone. But Bob follows, intent on proving his innocence and winning her back. At a charity auction, Bob proves up to the task.
