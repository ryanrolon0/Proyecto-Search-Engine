Ultra-Toxic

 Twitchy 22-year-old junkie Peter Shek escapes from a secret experimental laboratory where the scientists have implanted a micro-chip into his brain. Said micro-chip not only encourages Peter to get high through extremely unusual means, but also compels him to have sporadic lethal and violent outbursts. Meanwhile, a few spooky types track Peter's every move and two opposing factions fight over control of his life and mind.
