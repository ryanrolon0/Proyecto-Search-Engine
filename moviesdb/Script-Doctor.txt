Script Doctor

 Just another day at the doctor's office nurses and physicians are busy. These patients need help with their screenplays. One requires two cc's of WhiteOut; a couple who can't seem to conceive an original idea are counseled to consider adaption (the option on an Elmore Leonard novel may be available). Into the waiting room comes a distraught screenwriter several days into shooting; his script ("B@tman 5, Batman Versus the Internet") doesn't work. The nurse calls a Code Blue and Dr. Goldman is rushed to the operating room. Even after a call to Roger Ebert, the script is flatlining, but Goldman will not give up. Can he resuscitate it?
