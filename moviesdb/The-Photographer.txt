The Photographer

 The year is 1929. James Lewis is a police photographer in a small suburb. His job involves high risks and little reward. Jem finds himself struggling to find a true standard of justice amid his turbulent times. Ella Reinhardt is a banker's daughter. Her mother died at an early age and Ella is left alone in their spacious home with her preoccupied father and a mystery her mother left behind. Jem and Ella are linked together as, quietly and unobtrusively, a thunder cloud threatens to drench them in a downpour that will reveal a mystery and leave an indelible mark. In every life there are hard choices to make. Only God can know what the world will look like beyond the storm.
