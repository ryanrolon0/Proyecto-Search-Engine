Waters of the Arrawarra

 For many thousands of years, the Gumbaynggirr people of the New South Wales mid north coast harvested the waters of the Arrawarra Headland, catching fish and other seafood with their stone fish traps. But with the onset of European colonisation, these traditional hunting practices began to wane until interest in these ancient structures was rekindled in the 1970s.
