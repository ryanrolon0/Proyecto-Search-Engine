Saving David Powell

 'How much pain is enough to make up for irreparable harm?' David Lee Powell held all the promise and hope of the gifted college student that he was in the late 60s. He was an idealist who fell into drug addiction and lost his way. In 1978, he was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Officer Ralph Ablanedo in Austin, Texas. After 32 years of living in desperate conditions on death row, after his case has been reversed twice, the State of Texas is moving toward executing him on June 15, 2010. Saving David Powell shows the true damage of the death penalty, from the inside out, as this man comes ever closer to the grips of the Texas death machine.
