The Absolute Truth of Thomas Schviefel

 Our hero, Thomas Schviefel lands heavily in a gated community in Warsaw. We pursue him as he stumbles across a psychedelically tinged version of the Polish landscape passing through a rainbow of color drenched realms and encountering the inhabitants of each domain elderly ladies, guard dogs and architects.
