The Toy Soldier

 A young boy, harassed by bullies, prays for protection, and soon finds a doll submerged in a pool of toxic water. He brings it home and wakes to find it has transformed into a real-life, six foot toy soldier. Have his prayers been answered? Or have his nightmares come to life? A cross between E.T. and My Bodyguard, THE TOY SOLDIER is a classic revenge story, with a supernatural twist. It imagines a new superhero, and offers an alternate vision for the world's most-loved toy.
