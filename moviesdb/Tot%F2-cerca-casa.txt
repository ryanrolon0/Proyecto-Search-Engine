Totò cerca casa

 Beniamino and his family have lived in a school from the end of World War II. But five years have passed and they are compelled to move. In Rome, however, it is difficult to find an apartment. First he gets a job as keeper of a graveyard but in the night they mistake Checchino for a ghost and they flee. Then they try lo live in the Coliseum. Last they find a fine and large apartment, only to find out that the same apartment has been rented to other people too.
