 The story tells about a young man, who is trying to live solely through the love for a Woman. He is trying to perfection this love in relationships with each of his women, in the same time being able to give the relationships up, if it loses genuineness. Even though he considers each of his women to be special, after all it is just a game fulfilling his own emotional needs. When he meets a rival - in a way similar to himself, but married and monogamous man - he is forced to lose the battle.
