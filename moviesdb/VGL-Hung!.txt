VGL-Hung!

 Terry is an average and slightly insecure bloke trying to navigate his way through the cutthroat world of gay life in London. Frustrated with his nights out at the clubs, he decides to surf for porn on the Internet and perhaps try online dating. He stumbles across a special website called Manfinder, which miraculously transforms him into any type of man he wants to be for whatever dating encounter he feels like at the time. The only stipulation is that he has to find what he's looking for by noon, or else... As Terry miraculously changes into the different variations of the man he would like to be, he goes on a series of dates, believing each will fulfill his wishes. But as each date fails and as the strike of the clock hits noon, Terry comes to the realization that he is just one of several average looking men searching for love in all the wrong places and that he has been on this quest without really seeing what has been in front of him.
