The Cowboy's Ruse

 John Norris, a wealthy Chicago broker, is spending the summer in the West, accompanied by his daughter Nellie. He meets Mrs. Thompson, a young widow, and the trio spend many happy hours together. One day on the golf links, Mr. Norris instructs Mrs. Thompson in the mysteries of his favorite pastime and she becomes so interested she mistakes him for the ball. Nellie's ball has rolled under the fence and she is vainly trying to recover it when Walter Pierce, a young cowboy, rides up and dismounting, returns the ball. They are mutually attracted and the cowboy is made happy by an invitation to call. The following day he presents himself at the hotel and meets John Morris, who intimates that they do not desire his acquaintance. Walter Pierce determines to see more of Nellie regardless of her father's objections and plans a ruse. He calls the boys of the 'Circle Heart' together and plans to hold up the Easterner and kidnap his daughter on their next drive in the mountains. Accordingly Mr. Norris is held up by the erstwhile bandits, his daughter is kidnapped, and he is left to the tender sympathy of the not unwilling widow. The cowboys deliver Nellie to Walter and he 'rescues her' from the bandits. Arrived at the scene of the holdup he returns the daughter to the distracted father, who is overcome with gratitude and invites the young man to call whenever he wishes. Matters have progressed most favorably for him with the widow and he feels that, should his daughter's acquaintance with her rescuer ripen into love, the widow--as his wife--will compensate for the loss of his daughter."
