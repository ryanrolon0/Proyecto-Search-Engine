The Spooky Healing

 On the other side of a shaking door a rag doll inside a man's black shoe. The woman takes him to bed. Darkness and nightmares. She sends herself a message in Morse code. Next morning, after watering an onion, she starts a loving relationship with him. But suddenly, in a dreamlike state, she feels anger and throws him away. She leaves him in a narrow corridor and vanishes without trace climbing up the walls. When she returns home, however, something moves her to bring him back. He's full of thorns now. Then a healing takes place...
