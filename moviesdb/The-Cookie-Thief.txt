The Cookie Thief

 Arguments. Accusations. A relationship on the rocks. When Lynn Margolis decides the best way to deal with her problems is to not deal with them, she heads to the airport to try to escape. If only it were that easy. As she moves through the busy airport her inner thoughts and emotions come to life, forcing her to confront the conflicts she'd rather avoid. When her flight is delayed she buys a bag of cookies and sits down at the gate to enjoy a moment alone. But the man sitting next to her has another plan, which turns a simple plane trip into a grueling struggle between two strangers that will turn the tables on them both.
