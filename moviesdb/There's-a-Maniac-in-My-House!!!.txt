There's a Maniac in My House!!!

 Vicious deranged masked homicidal lunatic Rory O'Kill terrorizes several screaming scantly clad bimbos in an old rundown house. Can Dr. Detective Fenwell stop gory Rory before he racks up a substantial body count? Or are a lot of shrieking young lasses in skimpy clothes going to taste the lethal steel of Rory's bloody blade?
