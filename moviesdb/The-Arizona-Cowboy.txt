The Arizona Cowboy

 Ex-G.I. Rex Allen, a song-singing, bronc-busting cowboy for the rodeo show ran by Colonel Shawnee Jefferson is arrested by Sheriff Elmer Fuller as an accessory in the theft of $50,000 from the Dusty Acres Irrigation Company reported to have been stolen by his father, Ace Allen, who has disappeared. Rex escapes and reaches the scene of the problem unknown and unrecognized. The real crooks are Hugh Davenport and his uncle Jim, head of the Dusty Acres band, who have kidnapped Mr. Allen as part of a scheme to wreck the community irrigation project which, they figure, will mean ruin for the farmers and ranchers who have sunk their savings into it. They plan to foreclose the mortgages and drill for the rich oil deposits they have secretly discovered. Rex, posing as a cowhand named Arizona Jones, obtains a job as a ditch rider and aided by Laramie Carson, daughter of his dad's partner David Carson, and cowhand I.Q. Barton, begins the project of clearing his father and trapping the real crooks.
