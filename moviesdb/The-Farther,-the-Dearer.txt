The Farther, the Dearer

 The dream of independence in Lativa came in 1991 but it has become an economic nightmare as families struggle for any quality of life in a new market economy. Aleksej Fedjukovs, a migrant worker from Seda in Latvia, paid an agency to find him a job anywhere in Europe. It happened to be Belfast. The Farther, The Dearer is a personal insight into sacrifice, patience and hope and follows Aleksej over a year and a half as he works to get his young family settled in Ireland.
