The Third Bill Cosby Special

 Bill Cosby suggests a way to put the squeeze on burglars-Take a python in as a border, of course. Tonight's color-cast is full of such provocative suggestions, as Bill ranges over a variety of topical subjects-from the fight against crime to the population explosion; from 200-mile-an-hour autos to the mixed blessings of kindergarten.
