Sex Trek

 Plot Summary 69 to retrieve Charly Walker, the lone survivor of a spaceship crash, marooned on a desolate planet for 20 years. Charly turns out not to be a grizzled old spaceman, but a "hot babe" in her early 20's. But that's not the only surprise in store for Captain Quirk and crew in this parody that blends two episodes of the original Star Trek series. Charly possesses an insatiable libido and the ability to transmit her consciousness to others, effectively wresting control of their bodies from the owners. She bends one crewman after another to her will and whim, even taking a turn as Captain Quirk. All your favorite characters from the series are here, albeit slightly skewed half-human/half-alien science officer from the planet Horny, helmsmen Jackoff and Screwyu, engineer Mr. Squat, the delectable Yeoman Gland, and a stunning African communications officer Lt. Uwhora (pronounced "You whore you").
