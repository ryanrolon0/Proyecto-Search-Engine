The Audacity of Democracy

 THE AUDACITY of DEMOCRACY is a new feature-length documentary film which follows the PUMA (People United Means Action) group through the tumultuous summer of 2008, during which they attempted to derail the tidal wave campaign of Barak Obama and clear the way for their candidate of choice, Hillary Clinton, to seize the Democratic nomination at the Denver, Colorado convention. THE AUDACITY of DEMOCRACY is funny, ironic, shocking and tragic. A sympathetic yet unflinching look at a genuine grass-roots political action group determined, for good or ill, to change the course of American history.
