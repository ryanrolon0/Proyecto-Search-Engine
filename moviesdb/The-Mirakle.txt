The Mirakle

 Two priests, Pep and Bruno, become fed up with preaching day after day to a congregation that is not present. They have truly hit bottom, and will do anything necessary to bring the community back into the church. After a few failed attempts, Bruno goes on a soul searching mission by himself in the woods. He comes across a false prophet who claims to be a priest, and offers a vial of miraculous holy water. The holy water reveals itself to be a concoction extrapolated from the souls of lunatics, and ultimately causes the main priest to have horrific visions. We are left wondering what happens to the church, as well as the people who have now come seeking a vision induced by the potion of a mad man.
