Ram Jaane

 Ram Jaane is arrested by a security guard after stealing cargo from a train with his best friend. He is shortly released and becomes one of the biggest hustlers in the city. After a deadly shootout, he is arrested by a corrupt police department and sent to jail again. After a few years of serving jail time, he goes back to the streets and to his friend's place. There he decides to help him raise the local kids in the area so they won't be corrupted by the streets. He quickly falls in love with a childhood girlfriend Bela (Juhi Chawla), but also goes back to his old ways. Abandoned at a very young age, an unnamed youth faces taunts about his name and religion. He asks a priest what his name is. The priest answers "Ram Jaane" (God knows), which the youth accepts this as his name. He grows up to be a career thief and criminal, and ultimately a feared gangster. He is in love with his childhood sweetheart, Bela, and believes that she too loves him. When other gangsters decide to take-over the building in which Bela lives, Ram decides to oppose them, so as to impress Bela, and get her to marry him. Ram only ends up antagonizing the gangsters and their men, and finds out that Bela dislikes him, and wants to marry another young man by the name of Murli.
