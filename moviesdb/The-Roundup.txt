The Roundup

 At Janet Allen's wedding to Steve Payson, owner of the Sweetwater Cattle Ranch, Greg Lane, her former fiancEe whom she thought dead and Steve's best friend, turns up. Greg disregards the fact she is now a married woman and tries to make love to her behind her husband's back. Soon, on the Sweetwater ranch, against a background of Indian uprisings, rustlers, gun-running and bandits, the young bride is torn between loyalty to her husband and a burning love for her returned sweetheart.
