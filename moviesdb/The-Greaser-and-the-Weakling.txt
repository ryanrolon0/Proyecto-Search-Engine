The Greaser and the Weakling

 On the death of Mrs. Burgess, her two daughters came home from the East. The ranch foreman paid his respects to the widow, and incidentally lost his heart to pretty Mabel. Claudine, the other sister, found herself beset by Jim Bradley, but little suspected that Jim was the victim of a cunning Mexican's tongue. They planned-Jim and the Mexican- to marry the girls and obtain control of the ranch.
