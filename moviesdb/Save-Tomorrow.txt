Save Tomorrow

 A week after Keith's wife had killed herself by jumping from the cliffs at Beachy Head, Keith found himself at the cliff edge contemplating the same fate. Instead, he met another suicidal woman who took a run at the edge... but Keith stopped her. Transformed through this event, Keith found his calling and began patrolling the cliffs to find others in their ultimate hour of need; and to try and talk them down.
