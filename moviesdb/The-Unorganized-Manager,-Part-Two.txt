The Unorganized Manager, Part Two

 The story of Richard Lewis--a harrassed overworked and over stressed area manager for a contract catering company. Richard is a well meaning man, but always cames off badly in his dealings with the boss, his Team of managers and his secretary because he hasn't learnt the two essential lessons of being a manager--how to organise himself and how to organise the others.
