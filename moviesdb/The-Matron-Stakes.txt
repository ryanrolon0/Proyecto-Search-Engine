The Matron Stakes

 This is a composite picture of one of the biggest of the American Turf events. Cameras were placed at the first quarter, the half and the finish. In this way the horses are taken around the entire race. The finish is very exciting and the picture has occasioned much favorable press comment wherever shown. The winner of the race is Mr. Clarence Mackay's "Heno." Among the other prominent contestors were W. C. Whitney's "Yankee" and "King Hanover," Pepper Stables' "Whiskey King," Albermarle Stables' "Lux Castra."
