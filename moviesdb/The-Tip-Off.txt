The Tip-Off

 While on a job, cocky young radio repairman Tommy Jordan meets Baby Face, enticing (if dizzy) girlfriend of jealous boxer Kayo McClure. Fleeing Baby Face's flirtatious advances, Tommy jumps from the frying pan into the fire when he pursues Edna Merino, girlfriend of Kayo's gangster manager Nick Vatelli. Can Kayo save Tommy from being "rubbed out"? Or will fearful Baby Face hold Kayo back?
