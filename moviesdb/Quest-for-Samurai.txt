Quest for Samurai

 Two mid-level sales reps JOHN JOHNSON and his partner TODD PUDOWSKI have big dreams and unorthodox methods to develop those dreams into reality. With the help of two new hires JUSTIN TIME and DIANNA WONG they begin snatching up new clients left and right with relative success. Jealously quickly ensues around the office, lead by the ice queen herself PAULLETTE McBRIDE; who quickly dismissed John's success as haphazard until he ropes in the largest client the company has ever had, nearly sending her over the edge. Paulette retaliates with her own new hire, hoping to counter John's success; or ruin him one way or another, eventually forcing John, Todd, Justin and Dianne pursue a bid to take over SAMURAI from its present General manager RICHARD DICKSON.
