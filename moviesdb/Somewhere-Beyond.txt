Somewhere Beyond

 Late one night in 1984, an intruder broke into a home and raped a young woman. Soon after, the man was caught, and sentenced to life for assaulting her and three others. Twenty-three years later, the woman decides to confront the man who raped her, and speak to him, in prison, face to face. That encounter would change both their lives - and the lives of many others - forever.
