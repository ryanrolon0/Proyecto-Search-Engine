Roll

 Innocent country footballer MAT plans to spend one uneventful night in the city before his important AFL trial game. The same night his stuff-up cousin GEORGE is embroiled in a drugs delivery for ruthless loan shark TINY. In eight hair-raising hours of twisting fortune on the run from the law and lawless, Mat will become a man and George will become a hero. When the odds are against you, all you can do is roll the dice, roll with the punches and stick with family.
