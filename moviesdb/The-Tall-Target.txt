The Tall Target

 The plot to kill Lincoln as he passed through Baltimore on his way to Washington D.C. to be inaugurated in 1861 is in no way historically doubtful. This incident, called "The Baltimore Plot" by such well-known Lincoln scholars as Mark Neely Jr. ("The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia") is an historical fact. Certainly, the details presented in the movie may themselves be historically doubtful -- but not the plot itself.
