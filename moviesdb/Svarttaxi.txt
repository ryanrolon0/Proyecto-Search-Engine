Svarttaxi

 Marko is a caring family father trying to earn his living by driving illegal taxi during late nights. Business is good until a policeman in civilian clothes takes a seat. The policeman just happens to know about a robbery earlier the same day and Marko just happens to be sitting in the suspected getaway car from the very same robbery.
