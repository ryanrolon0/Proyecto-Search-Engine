Southern Fried Rabbit

 Bugs heads toward the record carrot crop in Alabama but runs into Colonel (Yosemite) Sam who is under orders to let no Yankee cross the Mason-Dixon line. This cartoon has not appeared unedited on American television for decades. The edited sequence shows Bugs Bunny trying to cross the Mason-Dixon line in black-face (brownface?). He sings two songs (the second of which, "Yankee Doodle", enrages Confederate Sam) then, placing a whip in the bewildered Sam's hand, Bugs acts as if Sam is going to beat him. Bugs then exits and re-enters as an indignant Abe Lincoln. Bugs Bunny's latest run-in with Yosemite Sam centers on a Civil War theme. Bugs, who resides in the drought-stricken north, learns of a record carrot crop in Alabama! A shot is fired Bugs' way upon his crossing of the Mason-Dixon Line a Confederate soldier fighting the Civil War. After Bugs' accurate explanation that the Civil War ended 90 years earlier falls on deaf ears, a chase ensues across Sam's plantation. Bugs cleverly disguises himself as Confederate Gen. Brickwall Jackson, tricking Sam into falling into a deep well; and a southern belle, who feigns protecting a Yankee soldier hiding in a closet (which actually conceals a cannon). Bugs (pretending to be a roughed-up Confederate messenger) finally gets rid of Sam by tricking him to Chattanooga, where a different set of Yankees happen to be.
