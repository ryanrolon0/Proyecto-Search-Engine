 In 1973 in Gainesville Florida, seven former Viet Nam vets and one non-veteran were all accused of planning to attack the 1972 Republican National Convention with automatic weapons, explosives, cross-bows, and slingshots. The accusation was part of the FBI's attempt to disrupt the efforts of the Vietnam Veterans against The War.
