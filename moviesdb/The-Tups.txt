The Tups

 Shot in the style of those serious, observational documentaries that appear to seek out the most depressing and depraved individuals in an attempt to portray 'reality'.  This comedy mockumentary follows Raymond Driscoll who lives in the once popular English seaside resort of Great-Yarmouth. Addicted to gambling and unable to play for the big money Raymond turns to the 2p Machines or 'the tups'.
