Stolen Sweets

 Wealthy but unhappy Patricia Belmont meets fun-loving insurance salesman Bill Smith (and his fun-loving friends Sam Ragland and Betty Harkness)on a ship cruise and falls in love, much to the annoyance of her high-society, fortune-hunting fiancEe Barrington Thorne. (When Bill and his friends visit the Bennett estate, Stoner, the butler, asks them to "Walk this way, please," and they oblige by imitating his bent-knee walk, in one of the first uses of this now-standard routine.)
