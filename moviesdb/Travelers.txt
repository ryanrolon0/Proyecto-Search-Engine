Travelers

 A man falls asleep one night and wakes up to find himself in an alleyway several blocks from his apartment. When the man arrives back at his apartment he finds everything the same way it had been two days earlier. He is even more surprised to see himself from the past walk into the apartment. Along with the help of his best friend, the man must figure out what has happened and how to fix it.
