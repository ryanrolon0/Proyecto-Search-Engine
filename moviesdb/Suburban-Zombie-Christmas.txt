Suburban Zombie Christmas

 SUBURBAN ZOMBIE CHRISTMAS is a horror-satire that takes place over the 12 hellacious days of Christmas in Bedford, Nova Scotia. When celeb grocery guru Pete Potter praises an exotic new spice for Christmas pies and puddings, Suburbanites line up in droves for it. Unfortunately, this trendy spice is a secret soul-destroying herb from the isle of Haiti, the ancestral home of zombie-ism. Uh-oh! When undergrads Bailey, Harry, and Zuzu return home from college for Christmas break, they discover that their affluent parents have developed certain new 'tastes'. Instead of keeping up with the Joneses, they're now eating them. And the kids are next! Irreverent madness ensues, roasting Christmas conventions over an open fire. Preppy Bedford soon becomes a bloody battleground, as our young heroes fight to find the lost soul of Christmas in the blundering cannibalistic beast that the holiday has become!
