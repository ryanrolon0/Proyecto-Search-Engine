Puzzle Agent 2

 When we last saw Agent Nelson he was left baffled by the suspicious town of Scoggins, MN and it's mysterious cult that is connected with the red gnomes that terrified Nelson during his investigation with the Scoggins Eraser Factory. The case was declared solved when it was claimed by Nelson's superior that the head of the eraser factory was safe and doing alright. Neslon however disagree that everything is alright in Scoggins. Not when he had some many questions left unanswered. Which leads him to return to Scoggins to shed some light on the conspiracy that is hidden in the small town. Nelson must be prepared at all times when encountering puzzles and the gnomes that he previously learned aren't the type of creatures to mess around with.
