Timothy's Room

 Based on a true story. After the death of his wife, Greg wants a new start for himself and his adolescent daughter, Molly. At first, they both seem to love their new home, but Molly has a hard time adjusting. She starts acting out, and blaming her bad behavior on someone else -- a boy named Timothy. Trouble is, Timothy doesn't exist. Greg tries to be sympathetic, but Molly's behavior grows increasingly worse. And she refuses to take responsibility for her actions. Tensions between the two mount. Until Greg begins to see things Molly's way.
