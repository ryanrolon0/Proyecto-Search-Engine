The Real Thing at Last

 A satire on American films, in which Shakespeare's Macbeth is performed as it might be imagined performed in an American film. (The film was prepared as part of a live benefit for the YMCA attended by the British royal family. Edmund Gwenn (QV) appeared onstage but not on film as the American producer.)
