Rear View Camera

 Rear View Camera combines an American wanderlust and obsession with cars with an emigre's sensibility. With brakes on, artist Julia Kim Smith takes a look through her car's rear view camera at love, fear, and immigrant life. Through juxtaposition of words and video, she poses the existential American question 'How did we get here?'.
