The Snow Schralper

 The Snow Schralper was created in less than 48 hours and was produced for the Big White Spring Fling Film Festival. The Snow Schralper is two minutes of Mitch Yrjola magic. Prior to shooting this video I had met Mitch very briefly on two occasions. He clearly enjoyed the attention and was fun to hang out with. Until we started shooting I had no idea Mitch was such an animal. This is a spoof based on the Hinterland Who's Who spots from the 70's.
