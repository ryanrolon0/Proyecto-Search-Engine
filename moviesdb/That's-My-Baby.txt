That's My Baby

 'That's My Baby' is a lighthearted look at maternal instincts gone awry. When two women in a park both lay claim to the same child, tempers flare and the fight is on. Though neither seems to have a strong grasp of parenting, both toss their conflict to the wind when the child's safety is threatened. Who is the real mother? Could the child have two mothers? What's best for the child? Assumptions about child ownership and child rearing are a gentle undercurrent in this rollicking physical comedy.
