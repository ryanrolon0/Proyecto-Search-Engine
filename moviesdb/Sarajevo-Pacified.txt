Sarajevo Pacified

 Emira and Adis both survived the siege of Sarajevo during the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. Now, more than 10 years later, Emira, aged 28 and Adis, 26, tell us about the life as a teenager in a war zone and how it has affected them. The interviews in the film vary with shots - at times very brutal - from the harsh reality of the war, both from the official archives as well as private recordings from people who lived in the war zone. With its unique language and strong intensity Sarajevo, Pacified is a journey through the memories of the two young people - memories they rarely share with others.
