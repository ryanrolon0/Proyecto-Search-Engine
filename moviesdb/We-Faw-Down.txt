We Faw Down

 Stan & Ollie are stuck at home with their wives, unable to sneak out to a poker game. When their friends call to ask why they're delayed, Ollie pretends it's their boss, inviting them to a show at the Orpheum Theatre. En route to the poker game, the boys offer to assist two young women, Kay & Vera, who are trying to retrieve Kay's hat from under a car. The boys also attempt to retrieve the hat, but are doused with water when a street-cleaning truck passes. The ladies invite them to their apartment to dry off. Meanwhile, Mrs. Laurel & Mrs. Hardy hear that the Orpheum Theatre is on fire, and rush out for news. While the boys relax in dressing gowns, Kay flirts with Stan, but he resists her. Suddenly, her tough boyfriend "One-Round" Kelly returns, finds Stan & Ollie, and pulls a knife on them. They escape out a window frantically pulling on their clothes, unaware that they're been seen doing so by their wives. On their return home, the boys tell an elaborate tale of the show they attended at the Orpheum that day-- until Stan notices the afternoon paper's headline, ORPHEUM THEATRE BURNS. Mrs. Hardy exits to fetch her hunting rifle . . .
