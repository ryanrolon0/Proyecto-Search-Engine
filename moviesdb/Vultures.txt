Vultures

 Based on the story "The Vultures of Wahpeton" by Robert E. Howard, the film combines somber violence with an underlying dark satire in telling the exciting tale of Steve Corcoran, a Texas gunslinger who finds himself far from home in a mining boomtown called Wahpeton Gulch. He soon finds it a place with secrets lurking around every corner when he accepts the job of deputy and is drawn into a conspiracy by The Vultures -- a gang of merciless, thieving, murdering outlaws. But Corcoran is his own man, and when danger threatens his saloon-girl sweetheart, Glory, he has to decide whether to remain quiet or to dispense his own brand of .45-caliber justice. The journey takes him from cowboy drifter to man of the law to lover. Along the way, he'll use every ounce of his cunning and pistoleer ability to save the town, the girl, and his own life.
